In: Boards ► News ► Events ► Gimel.US



E.S.Reaver



Posted on August 19th, Y1:I’ve seen a few articles and wanted to compile them. There’s a narrative here, if you don’t grasp it then bear with me an I’ll sum up my thoughts at the end.Article: Strange Reversals: Villain to Hero & Forum Thread



The number of heroes is rising. Multiple known villains have shucked off the black capes for white ones. Which is a good thing, right?Article: No Witnesses Remain & Forum Thread



The article identifies three villains who we know about in heroic groups – two with the Wardens and one with Shelter. They committed crimes, we have some limited information or scraps of wiki articles, but the witnesses of those past crimes are either dead or yet to establish themselves. We established standards for amnesty, but sometimes those standards can’t be met. The ex-villains find places on the team with nobody to naysay.Article: Two Black Raincoats & Forum Thread



Let’s get to the examples. Four youths tried to get superpowers by working off of the ‘trigger’ theory of power gain, and became a newsworthy case in 2004. The event got out of hand, one boy and one girl took charge and preyed on the two younger members of the group, torturing them over the course of a weekend. Nobody gained powers, the search for the missing children led to the two older children being identified as they went into town on the Monday to get food and buy power tools, including a circular saw. They revealed the location of their victims; one of whom apparently lost fingers as the wire that was used to attach them to the toilet tank was too tight. Unnamed Boy was sent to juvie. Unnamed Girl was sent to psychiatric care. Both gained powers while in care, both were released in or around 2009. Reuniting, now with powers, they killed three people, wearing black raincoats to keep the blood off, and were not caught. They have been spotted in several locations at the Rochester span, wearing the black raincoats.“For the time being, the amnesty applies,” Chief Armstrong stated to the media. “We know where they are and we’re keeping tabs.”Good enough?Article: “Rended”, “Torn Up”, “Dismembered” & Forum Thread



Written after Miss Militia and Vista, heroines under the Wardens, were seen on several occasions in the company of Hellhound, also known as Bitch or Rachel Lindt. Raises questions about the moral compromise the amnesty has wrought and the longstanding allegations that the Protectorate team in Brockton Bay was cooperating with the local villains. Once the relationship is established and we’re reminded of the past examples, the article devotes the latter half to reminding us of some of Rachel Lindt’s deeds when she was working with a group of warlords to seize Brockton Bay.“Every day, I wake up and I try to move my leg. The wind gets knocked out of me when it doesn’t move like it should. If I’m active at all during the day, then the pain hits me in the evening.”Article: Fallen: What You Need To Know & Forum Thread



The Fallen operate as a cult and they’re one of the largest cape groups around. The article doesn’t talk about it directly, but the forum thread has some great posts on the subject (see page 3 and 12). Their recruitment numbers are swelling and I (and others!) think it’s the amnesty that’s letting them get away with it. There’s a lot of talk of Lachlan Hund [article linked] elsewhere and there might be a court case revolving around what others are saying was a powers-assisted abduction. Totally Fallen M.O. for years prior, family says Lachlan never showed any pro-Fallen sentiment before this.Article:  No Cost & Forum Thread



Same article author as ‘No Witnesses Remain’. Following up on several villains who didn’t turn hero, the author finds two villains, both anonymous, who claim they received accommodations, at a time when many were still living in the tent cities. They got ahead of the ‘line’, they got basic apartments and utilities paid for, and they contribute nothing except the fact that they aren’t (as far as we know) committing crimes these days. It’s like we’ve caved to extortion.We need to have a dead serious conversation about the amnesty. Justice shouldn’t fall by the wayside. Absolutely horrific individuals get their second chances but they get them at the expense of the safety and peace of mind of others. They get things easier.We heard the arguments why at the start. We had other things to think about and deal with. Heroes had other things. We thought. We dealt. The heroes handled the biggest needs. That was then.Don’t get me wrong. I’m not buying into the anti-cape sentiment you see here and there.But I’m anti-these-capes. I’m anti-this.(Showing Page 52 of 52)► Dive Bucket

@ Mangled_Wings



1) villains aren’t cars. villains are humans. they’re accountable for their actions.



2) we have more choices than ‘get out of their way’. We’re part of a greater society. We have the choice of catering to them or treating them like the scumbags they are. we’re accountable for how we respond to them. our government is accountable for how they respond to them.



3) ‘imbeciles’ isn’t helping foster good discussion



4) can someone please ban mlekk? They’re in every other thread. Admin said they would deal with low-investment content



5) why the fuck is mlekk one of the only people with working badges?► Mangled_Wings

There are three kinds of villain. There are villains at rest that don’t do anything unless bothered and they may be easy to bother. Don’t bother them unless you’re sure you’re stronger than them. If you don’t have powers you aren’t stronger than them.There are villains in motion. They want something or they’re going somewhere. Don’t get in their way unless you’re a lot stronger than them. Catch them from the flanks or from behind if you’re strong and clever enough.These two kinds of villain don’t budge. I’ve known a lot of them. I know how they operate. It takes a lot to move the ones at rest and it takes a lot to change the course of the ones in motion. You can’t do either. Don’t try.The third kind is the kind worth paying attention to and they’re the ones that are changing or that can change. Objects in motion stay in motion and objects at rest stay at rest and the times and situations to watch out for are when they change states.The people bitching here don’t know enough and don’t have the power to handle any of that. Get stronger. Get smarter. Leave it to the people who know stuff to tell each group apart and to know when to handle things.► New_Ohmstar

Adding articles, part III (Keeping to OP’s format):Valkyrie Interviewed and Thread Link



Rising star in the Wardens. Exceptionally powerful, many references to the Green Maiden or something? Might harken back to before my time. She is asked directly about this in the interview and deflects.Shepherd’s Crook and Thread Link (not many posts)



Team started up and fell apart. Reason why? One ex-nemesis and lover of the team leader was invited to the team. They went full yoko. Shepherds no more.Endemic is the word.► Mangled_Wings

Like me, New_Ohmstar. I have worked with more than twenty villains. I am a villain. When I give you recommendations about leaving sleeping dogs alone I am referring to myself. When I tell you that you want to get out of the way if I have something I want? Referring to myself.I am not one of the leeches. I pay for my own apartment. I make no trouble. Yet. Yes I am talking to the heroes. They keep their eye on me and I keep my eye on them. There are other factors. This makes degrees of sense you are not equipped to comprehend. For now it is fine and you should take my word for it.I’m aiming to get stronger. I’m aiming to get smarter. I am not the only one doing this. If you spend your time bitching on the internet instead of doing the same then you’re one of the imbeciles because things are changing and you will fall behind.I can verify any of this if I must but I don’t know how as I am new to this site.► Point_Me_@_The_Sky

⊙♦ Private Conversation with Point_Me_@_The_SkyMangled_Wings: You said you’d help.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Hello to you too.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Click on your username while reading any thread you’ve posted in. Go to the Help panel. There will be a list of options. Third box, second option, badge verification You might want to open a new window so you can go back from this convo to thatMangled_Wings: It says import image.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Take a picture of yourself in costume and a piece of paper with your username on it. Connect phone or camera to computer. Find the image and select it, hit the ‘select’ button on the bottom corner of the window.Mangled_Wings: I don’t have a phone or camera.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Does your computer have a camera built into the monitor?Mangled_Wings: Yes.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: OS360?Mangled_Wings: Yes. I think.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Draw the circle in the center of the desktop to open the radial menu. Hit ‘C’ and camera should be something visible. Open it, wait for your image to appear. You’ll want to be in costume. Hit space.Mangled_Wings: It made a shutter sound.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: You were in costume already?Mangled_Wings: It’s fine.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Sure. You’ll find the picture in the ‘pictures’ bubbleMangled_Wings: Thank you. I found it. I imported it. It wants me to put in a label before I hit select.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: ‘Villain’, I guess. I don’t know if you really want to do that. You might want to go ‘Cape’ if you want to fly under the radar. People are sore about villains these days.Mangled_Wings: I don’t fly under the radar. I know what I am and I know what I’ll be, if I don’t die first. Thank you for the help. I respect this more than I respect the more self-pitying of the invertebrates out there.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Alright.



 Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I’m unfortunately afflicted with desire to help people.Mangled_Wings: A dire inflection, that.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: 0:) I don’t know if you’re at rest or moving or if you’re open to change, but you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Things will go smoother if you don’t call them invertebrates or imbeciles



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: And maybe stay at rest a little longer, given the chance?



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I think they really need it



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: We all need it.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Also. It just occurred to me. If you connect at a library, you’ll want to delete the image before you go. Overwrite it once it is deleted to be sure.Mangled_Wings: You kill more flies with vinegar in reality.



Mangled_Wings: A person can rest only so long. I’m restless.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: What a pity.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Spend more time online. Geek out. Learn! Less time spent being bad!Mangled_Wings: I am not averse to learning. We will see if there is any pity to be had.



Mangled_Wings: I am at a library. I will do that.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: You can draw the circle and hit ‘o’ to find overwrite.Mangled_Wings: I already found it. Thank you. Goodbye.⊙♦ Invitation to Group Conversation by Strange_Mammal

In: Boards ► Parahuman Science



Azavael (PRT Science)



Posted on : June 4th, 2002[Article] Studies into Parahuman abilities presently catalogue studied powers into three major databases: the PRT database in the US, the Cambridge Parahuman Studies facility, and the EUJP International Listing. The lists are formed by way of interview and laboratory studies with each institution using universally standardized forms in addition to supplementary material. Each of these three institutions have stated an express or strongly-implied desire to understand and predict expressions of power and tie these expressions to the inciting incidents. However, a longstanding problem in this process is that powers expressed, inciting incidents, and contextual factors can be dramatically different across individual cases. While some common themes can be drawn out, derived results are traditionally very big-picture. It is only recently that databases have begun to include sufficient numbers of special-case triggers that allow more focused study of how powers are expressed. We identified cluster powers, serial powers, matched powers, and Nth-generation powers as the special cases to focus on in more focused examination of how power instances can be mapped and we posit a ‘Hinge Point’ illustration of power expression and theory.[Definitions] • Cluster powers are defined as powers wherein multiple inciting incidents occur either simultaneously or within a minute of one another. Such parahumans will have a collection of smaller powers related to the others. • Serial powers are defined as cases where an individual or multiple individuals in longstanding proximity to a parahuman will develop powers…[Click to read full article](5 of 280 replies match search criteria)► of5

⊙♦ Topic: Multi-Trigger Case Studies – Parahumans 303 Class Notes (Spinky) – September 15th 2009



In: Boards ► Parahuman Science ►Non-Articles



Rightsector



Posted on : September 17th, 2009From Wednesdays with Prof Spinky. Posted with permission. Cleaned up where I couldOverview: What are clusters?



Other names are mosaic p. expression, grabbag, multi



Effect on resulting power



Why important & Importance to study.



Case studies



Greater effects, things to keep in mindPt. 1: What are clusters?



2-6 people trigger at same time or very close together. Each gets a suite of powers. Person A gets Person A primary power and fragment of B, C, D, E, F.



Person B gets Person B primary power and fragment A, C, D, etc.Pt 2: Effect on resulting power



Term secondary expressions. Weaker or subtle power. Can be conditional.



Primary powers may be weaker than if they had triggered alone?



Powers inspired by others but not identical. Relation may be tertiary.



Example given firebreath -> fire something or something breath



Prof stresses this is very basic example



Term for staying element is hinge (old) or dominant (current). Relates to 1998 article.Pt 3: Why important & importance to study



Suggests powers aren’t 100% predetermined. Certain elements are highlighted or made dominant.



We can extrapolate from studies like this & serial triggers to work out key elements of existing triggers. What changes & why = what factors are important in standalone non-special trigger?Case Studies: two cases & how we look at them



Two case studies. Interview, self-reporting, examinationCase Study #1: Sunder Bros



Take note for future week: matched powers. We come back to this.



Brother #1 – Destruction caused to objects ripples out indefinitely, stopping at clear demarcations (images included in lecture notes). Weapon extension without limit (except convenience)



Brother #2 – Weapon sweep extension – some range extension – wider arcs, shockwaves left/right of swing. Stomp to destroy ground in immediate area.Class pauses, prof asks & responds to input re: dominant factors in each power.Cute girl in red top finally comes up with answer that satisfies Spinky. Destruction & weapon attack augmentation dominant/staying/hinge factors. Question of range vs. breadth between brothers. Not very lopsided in power difference b/w primary & secondary power. Spinky’s stress on not.We get some slides of brother’s recreation of trigger circumstance. Distance from threat. Prof Spinky highlights personality traits brothers used on forms they filled out. All as reasoning for different power expressions.Case Study #2: Fowl & Fair (foreign capes, names that follow are badly translated)



Oxfair – Physical augmentation; size, strength, speed, agility (<- primary), deafening roar, transfer harm from falls/some impacts to nearby others, pain resistance/faster healing



Ramfair – Emotion affecting chant, size increase, some ability to heal very recent damage of others listening to chant/that touching, gather strength/concentrate -> giant leaps



Foulcock (yes, the class laughed) – Flight with build-up of speed over time, speed is transferred to touched others, interrupting flight to deliver high-impact blows. Increased agility, deafening shriek, fast recovery of smaller wounds (scratches yes, no recovery of larger wounds).



Foulpig – Personal biokinesis, swell into flesh bubble with fast recovery/personal mutations if not ‘popped’ in time. Some strength & size increase, but slower while grown. Ability to ‘roll’ with incoming impacts (mover expression? Turns into boulder). Guttural noise (flatulence? Burps?) to interrupt thought processes – turn off others’ brains momentarily.Discussion of dynamic. Fair & foul on opposite sides post-trigger. Only fair provided answers & allowed power testing, rest has to be inferred. Handouts.Some discussion of trigger event (see slides for images), some discussion of resulting ‘package’. Powers for each individual distinct but play off each other in semi-complementary way. Reflective of personality? Or ‘guiding hand’ principle?Pt. 4: Greater effects & things to keep in mind – things touched on in homework reading:



Kill / Kiss – more on this in parahuman psychology class in a few weeks



Personality Bleed – personality traits bleed over from 1 individual to other? Messy



Higher incidences of paranoia, confrontation, aggression, PTSD. Less bounce back?



Higher rate of death post-trigger. Kill / kiss again. Graph



Prof Spinky stresses emotional states may play into the above. Triggers that are sufficient to draw in multiple individuals are worse than average. Can’t jump 2 conclusions. Correlation =/= causation.(2 of 1140 replies match search criteria)► of5

In: Boards ► Parahuman Science



Jr_Max



Posted on : February 18th, 2005[Translation] Colloquially known as the kill/kiss dynamic, in cluster-triggers, there is a very high tendency toward passionate relationships, either hostility or partnership. Clusters have a 40% chance of one member murdering another, rising to a 50% chance when including attempted murder, 25% chance of a partnership forming, and a 10% incidence of partnership and murder coinciding. The term partnership is used for romantic pairings in instances where sexuality and gender allow, and close friendship or formed teams with members in other cases. In some (10% of) cases of close partnerships forming, the romantic pairing occurred despite one’s typical sexuality. The relationship entanglement study looks at existing cases and clusters to investigate why.The most dramatic case in recent memory is the Stáj, also known as the Stable, or the Foul and the Fair. The Good Ox was turned into a grisly display […]

17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: That leaves three options. The Kansas Cornfield massacre: 3 dead, 1 alive with no reason to care about multis. He ate the rest of his cluster.of5: Ate?17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: The book fair. Only ones still alive there are within spitting distance of me.



17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: Ate. I know why, too. I can share, but not for free.



17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: Leaves two good options. I can skip one because it’s mine.



17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: You’re part of the new cluster from the mall.of5: No comment.17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: I found one of you already. I reached out to him first. He said no. Bad for him. Lucky for you.of5: Lucky?17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: The one I talked to said there’s a woman, two boys, and him. I’m going to assume you’re the one I’ve termed the runt. The smallest, easiest target.



17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: The woman is gathering funds to hire mercenaries and come after you. The one I talked to hired an information broker to find you. Her name is Tattletale. She’s good. She has resources. including the mercenaries I just mentioned. She’s also preoccupied for now.



17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: A favor from me to you.



17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: That leaves you & the last one. It sounds like all 3 are coordinating vs. you.



17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: I can just about guarantee the people they’re gathering together are better than the ones you got.



17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: You need help. You’ve got a case of Kiss/Kill like I never saw and I don’t think they’re reaching for the chapstick.of5: You’re wrong17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: About the need for help?of5: It isn’t Kiss/Kill.

Lucky Luke (Hero)



Posted on : August 16th, Y1[…] We were ultimately unable to stop them, as they had two capes we had no information or records on. The first of the capes may have been a thinker, likely the same that shot down our flier. We were unable to glean much more from them, other than the fact they wore fur in the midst of a heatwave.



The second individual seems to be a grab-bag cape. She was a woman with a fanged mask covering her lower face, and a form-fitting dress with a slit up the side of one leg. She displayed a mover power [fourth term] with the ability to run on walls. She produced an emotion-affecting [third term] roar, which broke the ranks of one of the cooperating teams, and had metal claws [second term] which looked to be of tinker make. These claws may have been what enabled her to tear [First term not met, but within allowance] down doors and other barricades with the ease she did. We have the beginnings of a work-up going online shortly.The attack on the store opening was a failure on our side. We were late to the scene due to geography and we lacked full knowledge of our adversaries. It is our belief that with PHO in working order and more collaborative tools and measure being put in place every day, that we will succeed next time where we failed this once. We are working with authorities to keep an eye out for the stolen merchandise.[…]■♦ Joined Group Conversation: Questionable_Mammal, Heart_Shaped_Pupil, Cap

In: Boards ► Gimel.US



Khain (Guild Staff)



Posted on August 22nd, Y1:The Guild is presently established in three facilities outside of the city in Gimel.US, supporting authorities and serving as bodyguards and representatives for the onetime denizens of Earth Bet, as new areas are surveyed and contact with new cultures is made.The process is exciting and interesting, and we report back as much as we are able, but it does have its hazards. After two recent incidents, we have decided to reach out to those we are familiar with, who are familiar with us. This forum is one of many places we’ll be striving to communicate needs and necessities.Humans are explorers by nature. Our best count right now, excepting areas we cannot fully access, is that portals, devices, and tears between realities are currently allowing access to forty-seven Earths. Six of those Earths have been blocked off due to implicit threats or are fundamentally inaccessible. Two more have been closed off at the request of their denizens. Earth Aleph, which most Earth Bet residents are or were familiar with, has been blocked off as well.Speak with authorities before making any trips to territories unknown. We don’t and can’t mount effective rescue operations if someone leaves and fails to return, but we have some ability to do so if and when authorities know where you’ve gone and you’ve stuck to the established route. People got lost or stranded in the wilderness on Earth in 2012, with all that world’s satellites. It can and will happen in new universes.Do not travel to inhabited worlds. Absolutely do not make first contact. The first of the two incidents noted above was one where a family traveled across Earth Chamesh and happened across a settlement we were currently talking to. Much confusion and concern was had and we are still recovering.The second is to please stick to charted territories. Exploring the uncharted is exciting, but if you aren’t equipped, you can come to harm, even if the world is uninhabited. One ex-Bet government (which shall remain unnamed) sent one expedition to Earth Achat. The Europe of that world was home to an invasive species, which grew as a tubular mold in dark, shadowed spaces, particularly in forest. Eating food exposed to the spores these molds created causes stomach cramps that progress to reflexive vomiting over the course of two to five days. The vomiting then lasts another two to five days, causing death by dehydration for any who don’t receive care.Be aware:



• Earth Gimel has been partially explored and checked by thinkers. There are no guarantees. Except for some rare indigenous colonies, it is unsettled. Gimel has five major points of settlement, with civilization finding its foothold around these points. The City, as of yet unnamed, is the primary US point of settlement and one of the primary waypoints. The City is a megalopolis with a commonly cited population of fifty million. A rough map (one month out of date) here.



• Earth Mem has been partially settled by others from Bet. We are currently trying to establish some kind of communication and link.



For novice explorers and those looking to settle new territories, we would encourage Gimel and Mem as largely safe options.• Earth Bet has been deemed uninhabitable. Contrary to popular belief, radiation is not a major concern. However, many industrial sites were either destroyed or have weathered the last two years of neglect poorly, with chemicals leeching into groundwater and settling in valleys. Terrible numbers of deceased humans and other living species have led to other health concerns, particularly in previously heavily settled areas that received heavy damage. There will always be those who attempt to hold onto what we have lost, and many persist in trying to maintain some existence on Bet. However, new incidents arise on what seems to be a weekly or twice-weekly basis, with one in three having to do with powers, the powered, untended tinker technology, masters, and lingering threats. We may one day return to Bet, as some groups have fervently expressed a desire to do, but we have a great deal of work to do before this is possible. It may not happen in our generation or our children’s generation. Be aware that if you choose to return to Bet (and most authorities agree you have the fundamental right to do so) you may have to re-apply for entry and you will very likely be putting your well being in peril.Speak with authorities before traveling to any other worlds. More information on multiversal threats.More information to be disclosed about outside threats and cultures as we have it.(Showing Page 108 of 270)► Ohearn

It’s about concentration. The fight happened near here. Scion attacked. We don’t know why but it might have had to do with the Slaughterhouse Nine, going by the news reports and what some have said. It might have had to do with the Simurgh. It could have been something else altogether. But things wrapped up near here. People came through and most of us picked two worlds to settle in, with Gimel as the big one.But a lot of people fought. A lot of capes. Many were foreign. The fight ended… and then? We are doing or did our best to get them home, but not all want to go home. Or Scion didn’t leave them a home to go back to. A lot of them have gathered into like groups. That’s where we get the weird corner-world settlements.► Venturain



Replied on August 22nd, Y1:



the corner world places aren’t inherently bad tho, right? we (my family) just got into the city one month ago. right away pressure pressure. we can move into city but standardized rent and we need to earn wage and we may be asked to move. best option is to move to city periphery and farm. they say they will give us tools and resources to get started but good spots are taken or very far away and farming isn’t easycorner worlds are closer in a way. go to noon, go to wherever from there.if we aren’t reconstruction or farming we aren’t wanted. so why become cogs in the city’s machine? we can strike off on our own. minor risk but total freedom► Slayer of Isaac



Replied on August 22nd, Y1:



@ Venturain – that was our mindset. My family tried it.



We had the bad fortune of settling at one corner settlement. Two points removed. We got off to an okay start. Shelter up, food out, basic needs covered. Regular trips to the city to supply up and cover more advanced needs.Winter of Year Zero caught us off guard. We thought we were ahead of what we needed but staying warm gets hard and getting warm means chopping wood, which means physical effort, which means needing more food.I was handling most trips into the city. I was worn out and got real sick. My brother handled one trip, asked for help, came back with capes.They helped, yeah. Then they took over. It was bad. You can find my photo diary on my user page.My brother went out and asked for help again. The second time around, the capes were willing to fix the problem and leave. Most of us moved back to the city. Bitter feelings.► Athonic

@ Venturain – there’s need for other work. doctors. teachers. there’s a need for people that are good at finding and vetting the skilled labor. finding qualified doctors and getting them to hospitals, finding teachers and helping to establish new schools.organization is the hardest part.many injured, many with special needs. i’m in robotics and prosthetics and there’s no shortage of need. my friend is a radiologist and he’s in high demand.► Lex_Dogbell



Replied on August 22nd, Y1:



Many of those things require education. Letters started arriving yesterday. Rejected, rejected, rejected. No education. My friends are saying government is holding off on setting up schools because there is so much need for physical labor, industry, agriculture.► mlekk (was mlekk)

Right now we don’t seem to have many threats at home. Things are quiet. The monsters are out there if they’re even alive. Sleeper is still in Zayin and seems contained there. The Birdcage was abandoned and we don’t know if the residents were left to starve. Few of the real monsters seem to be here. The dictators don’t have the infrastructure. Our best capes are off doing good work and seeing what’s out there. Our capes at home are calm and quiet. I’m okay with that.► Fishmon



Replied on August 22nd, Y1:



Not all of the dictators. Not every place was ruined. There are monsters out there who I will not name out of fear for my safety. They were kept in check back on Bet and nothing holds them back now that much of the world has evacuated. The weather may be bad there but they may not have had industry or other problems to taint things. Things are looking up here but there I think it may be hellish for the citizens. Who can help them? Is difficult. If calamity comes in plague or bugs or rats then the people suffer, but dictators will not let them escape. I make calls every day.► Moor (Guild)

Cap: Some of it.of5: I know what you mean about mental energy.Cap: right? time management is a nightmare even without complications. add family, team drama, having to look good for the cameras and magazines and I wasn’t exactly thinking about upper management. I listened to the boss and I winked at the intern with the cute butt sometimes.



Cap: I didn’t dwell on the ins and outs. so if you want me to supply info on the ins and outs of how the corporate capes work as a business, I can’t.

Did you disconnect?Heart_Shaped_Pupil: So I was thinking we should meet in the city. You were talking about logistics and I was thinking about where eveyrone was. you’re closest to me and we’re the same age I think? So I was thinking we could meet and talk strategy over fast food. We could even do something after and build team bonds and things like that. Maybe a movie or arcade. Whatever you want to do.



Heart_Shaped_Pupil: No pressure.

AvenG: No offense, but I probably won’t.Heart_Shaped_Pupil: ok.AvenG: Sorry. I’m trying to get a fresh start, the Wards were pretty good times but that was then. You and I didn’t talk then, with the age difference, so it’s strange to talk now.Heart_Shaped_Pupil: It’s okay. You were frontline and I was backline. You were a teenager, I was the brat.

Please note that conversations with site administrators may be recorded and reviewed.Shower: I’d like a moment if you can spare it.Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Hello.Shower: Thank you for the prompt response. I’m Graham. I’m with the PHO IT team. You can call me by my name or just ‘shower’.Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Hi Shower. What can I do for you?Shower: We had some unusual search activity that seemed to be causing congestion. Would you happen to know anything about this?Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I might. It would have been during off-peak hours though.Shower: We update infrastructure during off-peak hours. it slowed us down. It stalled us for three hours last night.Heart_Shaped_Pupil: oh that’s not good.Shower: You’re piggybacking off of our servers?Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I was trying to help. We’ve been updating the wikis as much as we can and three-fifths of the work is gathering data that’s helpful to others.Shower: We?Heart_Shaped_Pupil: It was a stupid hobby project. I was thinking of what everyone wanted the most and information seemed most critical. I had some guys I knew from way before and I thought I’d get everyone up to date and on the same page.Shower: We often encourage hobby projects on PHO, though we cannot when resources are as tight as they are, and it would depend on scale and the amount of mess created. How easy is this to dismantle, and do I need to talk to anyone else?Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Nobody else. It was me alone. I can fix it right now.



Heart_Shaped_Pupil: How bad of a problem is this? Is there any leeway?Shower: It’s interfering with others’ ability to access things. It might not seem like a problem here, because you’re close to the home node, but there are people on the periphery or far-flung regions and they’re going from satellite to ground to satellite to here, across several Earths.



Shower: I think it’s best if you clean up as much of it as you can.Shower: I think that since you’re a chat member in good standing, we’d be willing to let this slide with a warning if it can be promptly dealt with without any mess.Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I’ll have to reboot.Shower: I’ll talk to you shortly.You have left the conversation.⊙Connecting to “gChat.ParahumansOnline.Treefort_Lookout(6667)” (Attempt 32)

Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Your voice doesn’t translate well.



Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I think you’re intimidating and you want to be intimidating on the internet and that doesn’t work at all. C is the intimidating one here. Somehow. He has that knack. That atmosphere. The skill.Mangled_Wings: C is?Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Funny, isn’t it?Mangled_Wings: I think I hate the internet to the very center of my being.Heart_Shaped_Pupil: If you think about it, with powers and all, the center of your being could include the vast monster in another dimension that’s all hooked up into you. Passenger stuff. The center of mass could be in the middle of an alien god monster the size of a mountain or moon. I imagine it has the energy of a small star stored in it.Mangled_Wings: This serves to illustrate the depth and energy of my hate for a setting where C might be more intimidating than I am.Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I think I might agree with you on the hate thing. I want to meet face to face and hang out with S and you and maybe C and definitely Cap and R. I want that to work out.

Heart_Shaped_Pupil: you aren’t runningMangled_Wings: I don’t scare.



Mangled_Wings: The world is filled with blithering idiots. More are only blither and more are silent idiots. You’re the exception. If you will work for me then I’ll damn well make good use of you. I’ll incentivize you to stay around.Heart_Shaped_Pupil: okay.

After discussion among the moderation team, we have agreed to allow the name change. As we discussed in the tech help chat, our primary concern in these situations is an abuse of the system or a lack of accountability. This being said, your account is in good standing and you’ve agreed to a probationary status.Your in-account email, curated lists, private messages, badges, and accesses will remain intact, as will your forum account’s connection to your wiki contributions.Let us know if there is anything else we can help you with.

August 24th, Y1



Thank you so much! I am having another problem. I’ve been getting caught up on my PMs/DMs/Emails and there is a lot of abusive content. All of the recent messages are very hostile or vulgar. It seems to have started before I even signed back on. I don’t know why. I’m so sorry to raise problems when I’m probationary.Subject: Re: Re: PHO Technical Assistance



August 24th, Y1



Graham here. I looked at the incident log and found one major incident that another site admin handled. An article came out here. Two groups online identified the people in that article and shared out their screen names and other information. We took action when people used PHO resources (direct messages, email) to harass one of the individuals in the article. We took action and removed them, but they may be returning with the use of new accounts and expanding the number of people targeted.If you could report any or all of those involved, it would help us a great deal. For solutions, I can think of three options: you can continue to report so we can continue to take action (as these are not the people we want on PHO) and we can hope this quiets down, you can move to a new account and start fresh, or you can agree to give PHO staff access to your private messages so we can take action. This would involve us reading anything private in the conversations, and it would mean anyone messaging you was notified that PHO staff can read your things. We would limit this to only recent and new senders, so your friends and pre-existnig conversation partners would stay private. As a bonus the notification could help stem the influx.

In: Boards ► News ► Events ►Gimel.US



Ball-Chan



Posted on August 23rd Y1:[Article Text, Editorial]His list of credentials starts off good. A two year tenure as a member of the Boston Wards with no offenses or misconduct reported to the media. He was the third monstrous cape to feature as an actor on a television show, the first to make a second appearance on TV, and the first monstrous cape with an onscreen kiss. He was the subject of a viral online image, released with various humorous captions, and it was a combination of this and arguably his small-network television appearances that gave him his popularity. He rode this success to a position as the first monstrous cape to be the team leader of the Wards. Ambitious fellow, isn’t he?Weld’s popularity and time in the spotlight made him a figure of interest when, following undisclosed events in Brockton Bay, he turned from the established heroes and brought the vast majority of the monstrous capes in the Protectorate and Wards with him. Speculation flew as to why, and Weld was cagey when asked. No comment, the teenager said.Weld’s team was dubbed ‘The Irregulars’ in a play on the term for unconventional military squadrons and on the team being wholly made up of monstrous capes. At this stage, it was still possible to praise Weld for his efforts. He reached out to monstrous parahumans both American and international, and he kept his team together while carrying out deeds for the camera. Maintaining a group of such size isn’t an easy task when its numbers are swelling like his group’s did. He wasn’t too open about his methods or his team’s motivations.Things take an ugly turn from here. When Chevalier announced that the PRT was mending its ways and that the person at the heart of the organization’s corruption had been defeated, Weld’s irregular team of monstrous capes kept away and kept silent. Heroes called for unity, the Suits answered that call, sending many members to America to serve, following a schism of their own.Even the defeat of Behemoth or the appearance of the new Endbringers didn’t serve to bring Weld back into the fold. If anything, Weld seemed to note that his team’s numbers were dropping. He and the monstrous capes serving under him stopped making as many public appearances. We don’t know what he started doing at this time, but his team was still recruiting. No comment, Weld said.It’s telling, too, that Weld’s appearance changed. He decorated himself with horns and scales. To those with an eye for the symbolic, Weld was a monstrous cape who was embracing the monster and turning his back on the cape side of things.More time passed, and more silence followed. No comment, he said, on the rare occasions when he appeared in front of the cameras. No comment.On that Thursday, June 20th, 2013, Scion took our world from us. He took almost everything from us. Based on our limited accounts of what happened, Weld was there for the initial foray, an organized series of attacks mounted from an oil rig. He was not there after, leading a substantial portion of his team to other venues. There’s no indication of what he was doing, but we do know he wasn’t there for the skirmishes on other worlds, against other major organized groups of parahumans. We do know he wasn’t there for the follow-up confrontation on the beachhead.Many will argue it was a chaotic time. No reports are wholly accurate, the world was ending, and the number of parahumans fighting was no doubt mind-boggling. Why make a point of this in particular?To start with, today was the day Weld returned to Gimel after some time elsewhere. We’ve been told he was doing a combination of work in Earth Bet and spending some time touring other worlds in the company of the mass-murderer codenamed ‘Garotte’ and a pair of unnamed capes the two were friendly with. He was extended an offer to join the Wardens as a leader of one of the group’s cells, and he accepted.People are applauding, it seems. Weld led a rather formidable team of monstrous capes away from the field of battle, at that critical point in our recent history. He came back practically alone, his team gone. He’s tight-lipped as to why.His Wards team didn’t do very well either, for the record. We haven’t heard the full story from him there either. He claimed that he didn’t want to disparage his former employer, and that they were still on positive terms.Does he deserve the position?



Is he trustworthy?



Is he even that good of a cape or a leader?I’ll remind you of two of his favorite words, while you mull over those questions.“No comment.”(Showing Page 13 of 13)► Wytchmlj

Nobody is saying why things happened like they did. Some are hinting @ it tho.



A lot are hinting at it. Conspiracy of silence.



Weld seems to know things and like the article says he’s keeping his mouth shut.



It is his right to keep quiet. It is our right to say he’s an asshole for doing it.► Capricorn (Hero)

Guys guys guys. this is a hit piece and it’s a bad one at that.Full disclosure: I know Weld some. he was and is one of my favorite peopleBut come the fuck on. Everyone has a motivation driving them. skimming through the comments on this article makes that v. clear. YES absolutely wonder at weld’s motivations. wonder about everyone’s. wonder about the people who are pushing hard for moving forward and about the people who want to go back to the way things were. wonder about the person who wrote this article and why he has the focus he does.but don’t make the mistake of focusing so much on the question marks that you forget about the other punctuation marks & if someone shows you who they are then believe them. Weld’s teammates in Boston and Brockton Bay only had nice things to say about him. Period. Weld did charity work with kids he definitely didn’t have to do. Period. Weld served as team leader for a city in need and he kept his wards alive thru the Slaughterhouse Nine and God knows what else- exclamation mark.Weld has never shown himself to be anything but decent. if you’re filling in the blanks or raising questions then take your cue from that first & foremost.► Tdren

Silence isn’t an option. Things are heating up, people are scared and we’re scared for a justifiable reason. Powers came out, and we started seeing broken powers. People with mutations, people with no off switch. Monsters who needed to be quarantined. Endbringers.Now we’ve got a different kind of broken power.It keeps getting worse. It gets worse in a linear and steady way. These things follow from one another. There is a visible pattern and there is a sense to be made of things. The new broken powers follow from the people made monstrous by their powers. If Weld knows something we have to ask.We have no authorities. We have no system of government. We have no national cape team or licensed heroes. We can’t even agree on a name for Gimel’s megalopolis!We can discuss all day but at some point we need to make decisions. We need to say we deserve to know and if you won’t tell us then no you can’t represent us and no we won’t trust you to have our back.► FFlash

@ Capricorn – I think you have some bias you’re not admitting to here. You disappeared too, didn’t you? You left Reach and disappeared. A couple of your old teammates are saying they’re thinking about joining the Attendant and you’re not included in that. Why? Are we supposed to use your metrics to evaluate you? Go by the face you presented to the public?I think I’d rather read between the lines. Your old team doesn’t want you for a reason► AtoLo

1000000000s of human beings died or have yet to make their way to us.1000000000s.1000000000s of humans with families. mothers and fathers. good days and bad days.i say 1000000000s instead of billions because billions barely sounds different from millions and i think the zeroes drive it homethe city is as big as it is because we were lucky. we only lost about half of those close to us in N.E. US.refugees of Earth Shin say a parahuman took over their Earth a decade ago. one woman. she went back home to continue ruling them.there is a world not far from us which is at constant war. there are tears in reality they can use to reach us and they have a lot of incentive to do so. they have parahumans too.there is a theocratic state which is more distant but they have some parahumans too.there is a world of monsters like Weld and his irregulars.there are others, smaller. there are probably others who we haven’t been told about.every week we get a handful of reports of people triggering with broken powers. They burn bright and burn fast and they do a lot of damage.on the smallest level we are quiet and still because we are afraid to disturb the peace. but on the big level our new neighbors aren’t focused 100% on us. we’re important. we’re a powerful few even though we lost 1000000000s. the tyrant queen is looking at us but also watching over her shoulder for the war world and the monsters and the broken triggers. the war world is wanting to venture out but maybe an expedition is hard to field and they get broken triggers too. they’re getting more regular triggers.the truce will break, both on the small level and the bigwe are hurting from the loss of 1,000,000,000s and we are only just now reaching the point where we need to make decisions. what do we call ourselves? what direction do we go? Do we move forward or backward?Like i said we are smaller in number than we should be. we’re hurting. we’re distracted and scattered.but i think we have the most powers at our disposal. that’s important.and i think we’re best equipped to have the answers when others come asking. i think that’s the most important thing by far. they are going to ask and we are going to want to have answers to offer themi think we need people to start telling instead of hinting. information is the most valuable resource at all.► Yipper

Information is also more volatile than oil, nitro, or nuclear material. Look at the secret identity leaks going on in this thread. Targeted harassment of Weld & others. If hundreds or thousands agree to keep quiet about things then maybe there’s a reason.Let’s not turn into a rabid mob► Space_Squid

Humanity has seen its worst test yet and it came out the other side.I’d like to draw a comparison. I’ve read some of these pages and I see an effort to make us out to be the enemy. the monstrous capes are this mysterious thing and some of us are made out to know things that we aren’t sayingI can tell you who we are. just like you we’re scarred. we were hurt very badly and altered very dramatically and we didn’t get to know why. we desperately wanted answers because our histories friends and families were taken from us. we were forced out of our homes and thrust into a strange place and many of us were left desperate or dangerous. Just like some of you.We learned some partial truths and that made things worse. Then after a very long time and a lot of pain we learned most of the rest of the truth.I won’t pretend its easy. I struggled every day and then I struggled more after the end of the world.But we fought a hard fight whether it was to save the world or to get to safety or to climb out of dark angry depths. We came out the other side. Every day we survive is a day we can say “I was THAT strong so I can definitely survive this.” Replace I with WE because we are all together in this.I don’t know if that will work for you but it helped meEnd of Page. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 … 11, 12, 13⊙♦ Topic: help

Posted on August 23rd Y1:I would like to thank you all for reading this. I was invited to post here by Quasi after I posted in some other places. Quasi has been talking to me and resurring me.I remember hearing about the monster heroes and I never payed much attention to them. Now I think I am one.My name is Casey Forks and I would be starting high school this fall if things hadn’t gone bad. My mom hasn’t been well for a long time and my brother has the same condition so we decided to stick it out and whether things. we had a shelter and we had some food. my dad and I went to stores and raided them for more foods that would last and we stocked up.The shelter didn’t work out. we all got headaches and dad said the air filters weren’t sufficent. we went upstairs into the house and sealed all the gaps and dad tried to fix up the filters. long story short that didn’t work out either. I should have tried to get somewhere safe but I stayed. I shouldn’t have stayed.I didn’t think enough about monster capes or about those with powers but now I am both. Maybe I am not Casey anymore. I am frozen like the dead people who have lying on the ground for the years since the world ended, like a mummy without bandages. Mold grows on me and grows around me and it covers everything I can see and think about. I am a god of death and decay and I am an open fridge door with mold growing inside it and spilling out. with every passing day and hour and minute I am less like casesy and more a god of gross fridge stuff. my world of mold gets bigger every momentI grew mold on my dads body and I could make him move. I grew mold on his brain and I got him to think and with his thinking I finally got the generator and the router and the phones working. It helped that I grew mold on the pieces and parts.Now I am making my sister type because I cannot move any part of me a milimeter and I am asking heroes for help. I’m internet famous and there are articles written about my situation so that gives me some hopeBut more importantly I am trying not to lose my mind. Quasi is helping me with that and he said you would all help by sharing your stories.I am so scared that the heroes won’t save me but I am just as scared they’ll save me but they won’t be able to fix me. I am scared that I won’t be able to move. I am scared I won’t be able to hug a pretty girl or lie next to her in bed. I never cared about the rude stuff that much I thought that the cuddling would be the nicest part. I want to see the world through eyes that aren’t moldy and to take a deep breath and scream or even laugh. I want to play soccer again with all my friends there and I want my parents to be there and be proud.Tell me I’ll be ok.(Showing Page 3 of 3)► Casey_F08

Be strong brother. With powers all things are possible. Through trauma and struggle we find ourselves so much stronger. It takes time to adjust and it takes time and effort to find the right keys to the right locks. With help (and you have so much help!) Clocks can be turned back and flesh can be reshaped. We killed a god and the worst is behind us. Slowly but surely we will put the pieces back together. If I did not believe this 100% then I would not be here to write this message to you. Be strong.► Casey_F08

I read some of your old posts Casey. when you fractured your ankle playing soccer you were worried you would never play again but you got there. When powers are involved the lows are so much lower but the highs are high enough to make it all so very worth it. You are funny, smart and cool and people wouldn’t be rooting for you if you weren’t. Your fears echo mine when I realized what had happened to me. I worried I would never have control or have a boy next to me or anything else. I can tell you it is possible.► Fishie (Board Admin)

FlippinMad: Hi.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Hi. How can I help?FlippinMad: Thank you



FlippinMad: I’ve been thinking about things for a long time and I’ve been digging for info and answers and trying to put it all together. Is hard because people don’t want to talk about things and a lot of people don’t want to talk to me in particular. People get upsetPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: The world ended. It’s kind of upsettingFlippinMad: I know. I know



FlippinMad: you were there?Point_Me_@_The_Sky: We were all there toward the end. Very few exceptions.FlippinMad: thousands of capes were there and nobody wants to talk about the specificsPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: The answer will come out in time. It may already be out there in places. Communication is limited. Pockets of humanity are spread out and the people who have a say in info getting from city A to city B are probably wanting to keep things peaceful for now. Gov’t or what we have that passes for gov’t, PHO and the 12ish other online bodies…



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: they control info. But they can’t stop word of mouth. Not easily. We will hear the full story one day. I don’t know if it will be a good day but we will hear it.FlippinMad: Ok



FlippinMad: I’m stressing about it so I’m not sure if I can wait



FlippinMad: Can I ask questions and you can decide if you want to say or not?Point_Me_@_The_Sky: you can ask. I can’t promise any answers.FlippinMad: Thank you



FlippinMad: Did you know Skitter? Weaver I guessPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: I didn’t know her. Not really



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: We crossed paths.FlippinMad: She’s one of the people I ask people about and they get mad or defensive. Or they tell me they have something to do and never get back to mePoint_Me_@_The_Sky: Yep.FlippinMad: Why?Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Short answer: I can’t/won’t sayFlippinMad: OkayPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: Longer answer: I don’t know how things unfolded, but I think people fall into types and categories. I don’t know enough to say one way or the other but I think she was looking for something.FlippinMad: I don’t know if I understandPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: You’ve seen the video stuff?



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: She hurt someone you know?FlippinMad: I tried to find everything I could get. I’ve seen the cell phone movie from the cafeteria. I saw a few. not just the big one that was on the news. Then I went back to find other news and footage. Then I followed along



FlippinMad: Her joining the heroes and later with her talking to schoolkids but there wasn’t much good video with that second one. I saw the movie of her in New Delhi and I saw her on TV here and there.



FlippinMad: She hurt people I care about I guess. That’s not why I’m askingPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: I’ve seen the same. I saw her as the novice warlord



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: She hurt an awful lot of people. A crazy lot.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: She killed one of our best heroes



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: She also joined the Levi fight. She apparently helped against the S9. She joined the Wards



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: It’s hard to reconcileFlippinMad: That’s my problem



FlippinMad: I want to figure it out but there are gapsPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: I don’t have the answers for you. I can only theorize



Point_Me_@_The_Sky:  I read a thread on PHO a few days ago and it made me think. I said I think she’s someone who was looking hard for an answer. I think she was wounded and lost and for this reason & probably because of other factors she did a lot of damage while looking. The people she was with. Things being primed for everything to fall down. Timing or bad luck. Personality.FlippinMad: WoundedPoint_Me_@_The_Sky:  I’m looking at my history and I’m having trouble finding the thread



Point_Me_@_The_Sky:  there are people who are searching I think and there are people who just are. I think both can be good and both can be toxic. Some people are searching because of something that pushed them. A lot of capes just are. Some are doing the pushing, instead. And there’s all sorts of types.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky:  I don’t know her nearly well enough to say which she was but I don’t think she stood still. Or when she did stand still it was because she was on a precipice, looking for a push or for something to push. But again I don’t know her.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky:  You would have to explain more about what you want to know for me to give you any more of an answerFlippinMad: I pushed herPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: You pushed her?FlippinMad: I really hope you don’t block me or ignore me



FlippinMad: I’ll try to explain but give me a moment.



FlippinMad: Do you remember me? We met a few times but I think the only time we had a conversation was before the Vice-Versa photoshoot. There were six of us who were around the same age and the designers were taking a while.Point_Me_@_The_Sky:  I remember that. A bunch of non-capes from around the city, dressed up as capes, some of us local capes in fancy dress. Skitter wasn’t a part of that, obviously.FlippinMad: Yeah. I’m starting back at the beginning



FlippinMad: They picked top athletes, valedictorians, bunch of others.



FlippinMad: You were hanging out with us. Shadow Stalker and the rest of us were joking around.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I remember now. Emma?FlippinMad: Her friend. I’m the short one. It was her biggest shoot ever and she was super psyched. I tagged along. We were joking around and you were laughing with us and the staff were running around freaking out and trying to do last minute costume changes



FlippinMad: You were in fancy clothes and you had one of those masks on a stick, and Clockblocker was nearby complaining about having to hold his mask up until Ageis (sp?) got some ribbon and tied it to his head for him, which made the hairdresser freak outPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: Aegis



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: They catered those nonalcoholic soda cocktails with layered colors. We drank them like they were water



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: and the one woman’s eyes bugged out when she saw what the bill was. I felt so sorry for her.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: We gave the staff so much grief.FlippinMad: But that was part of the fun



FlippinMad: Yeah. It was like a dream, hanging out with heroes and cool people. Everyone was so fancy, including my friend. It was the one time in my life where I felt like I was one of the teens in one of those overly polished scenes in a teen movie where everyone looks so perfect



FlippinMad: I was really really hoping that they were going to just pull me in as an extra



FlippinMad: Because one of the kids they’d invited had backed out.



FlippinMad: But it didn’t look like it was going to happen and I was having enough fun that I didn’t mind too much. I said things and people laughed at it. And everything was great until thenPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: I said something didn’t I?FlippinMad: You called us a bunch of bitchesPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: That was it.FlippinMad: You said ‘This was such a nice night and you c-words had to spoil it by being disgusting. Come on.’



FlippinMad: and then you walked away and most of the heroes and heroines went with you or whatever. Leaving just me and Emma and a couple of others.



FlippinMad: They 100% went into…



FlippinMad: I don’t know what you call it. Defense mode. They wanted to bring things back to center. Normalize. They were saying things like “what’s bugging her? We weren’t saying anything that bad”



FlippinMad: And I was sitting there being quiet and I remember thinking they were wrong. we were kind of being bitches and we were kind of going too far when ragging on people who weren’t there.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: The disabled girl I think. We were having to wait because they were having to adjust her costume to work around her back brace.



FlippinMad: Yeah.



FlippinMad: We said something loud enough for her to hear from the other end of the room and you spoke up and then you went to go hang with her instead



FlippinMad: The night didn’t seem as magical after all that. I was really bothered.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I barely remember beyond that. I did the photoshoot and we tried to cheer the girl up. It was mostly great and I saw Emma a few times after that and there were no problems but we weren’t friendlyFlippinMad: It was the first time in my life I stopped and took stock and asked myself “am I a good person?”Point_Me_@_The_Sky: To an extent you get a pass. To an extent. We were 13-20 I think. You were closer to 13 than 20. Teenagers are shitty and most teenagers make a couple of mistakes. Not excusing it. It sucked as a thing. But teenagers being asshats mitigates itFlippinMad: No



FlippinMad: I was really fucking shitty.



FlippinMad: I think its worse because I had this wake up call and I asked myself if I was a good person



FlippinMad: Except I never got around to answering that question. I kept putting it off and feeling shitty about it



FlippinMad: We kept being bitches. And then a couple months after that we put Taylor in the hospital. Skitter. I don’t know if she had powers then but if she did then I don’t know why she didn’t murder us allPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: You’re the bullies that pushed her over the edgeFlippinMad: Me and Emma and our friend Sophia and Julia and a few others. But we were the main three or fourPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: I feel dumb not connecting those dots before. Preoccupied atm and I was preoccupied then. Fuck me. Emma was one of them? They kept your names out of the mediaFlippinMad: Word still got out.



FlippinMad: So this is where I am because I almost feel responsible? Or I don’t know if I’m responsible



FlippinMad: But we pushed her



FlippinMad: And after that she joined bad guys and robbed a bank



FlippinMad: And then somewhere after that the empire got upset at her and her group and called them out before attacking the city and RIGHT after that the Endbringer attacked.



FlippinMad: There were all these theories about why it attacked Brockton Bay and the big two were that there was a holy grail or something? I didn’t follow that one. They said it might have to do with why people wanted to control the city?Point_Me_@_The_Sky: A target. Something that would make the city valuable. Or someone. Endbringers have gone after specific people beforeFlippinMad: Ok. I don’t know. The other one was that the city saw so much fighting in a short time. Taylor was a part of that and I’m part of what pushed her out there



FlippinMad: I know I sound narcissistic and shit but…Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Are you gonna finish that sentence?FlippinMad: I don’t know. I feel responsible



FlippinMad: I was pretty much there at the beginning and I pushed her and…



FlippinMad: it feels like I was at the top of a hill and I pushed a rock down it and it rolled down out of sight



FlippinMad: and then this rockslide starts further down the hill and wipes out a town and kills this really important person and a whole bunch of other horrible things.



FlippinMad: …and I go looking and my rock is lying there in the devastation. Nobody’s saying what happened. her wiki page is gone and people get annoyed or upset when I ask. I want to know what happened when I couldn’t see. Every non-answer I get makes it worsePoint_Me_@_The_Sky: She was her own person. She made her own decisions along the line.FlippinMad: I know thatPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: You don’t own her. You don’t own every decision she made or the whole fallout



FlippinMad: I know. But I didn’t help matters.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: No. You definitely own some of it.FlippinMad: And you can’t tell me what happened.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I can’t & won’t. But I guess I can say this.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: With the evidence we have we know she did some good things. She did some bad things. She did some incredibly controversial things. She was more vicious and ruthless than she needed to be maybe.FlippinMad: Am I responsible for that extra viciousness and ruthlessness?Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Can’t say. Neither can you. But it probably didn’t fill her with smiles and joy did it?FlippinMad: I spat on her once. It was Emma who really got to her and Sophia who went out of her way to hurt her. I was…



FlippinMad: I put her backpack in the toilet once. Books, notebooks and all. The water was clear but it was still the toilet and yeah. I put glue on her desk and juice on her seat and I stood by when the others were doing the worst stuff.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Fucking why?FlippinMad: I don’t know. I never really stopped to think about it. My friend was a model and my other friend was a top athlete. Maybe I wanted to keep up. I told myself it was prank tier stuff but at the same time



FlippinMad: I’m saying this because this is like I’m confessing but like…



FlippinMad: Some time between when that photoshoot happened and when we put her in the hospital we were talking. Emma Sophia Julia and I. We figured we were falling into a pattern and we kept knocking her down when she picked herself up too much.



FlippinMad: and I had this moment where I saw she was really low and I spat on her. I remember the look on her face



FlippinMad: what the hell was wrong with me? I didn’t wake up to what I was doing until I got fucking caught which is just so doubly shitty. My parents found out when we all got called to school and that was the last time I interacted with Taylor. Moved away with Leviathan.



FlippinMad: I fucking spat on her facePoint_Me_@_The_Sky: Stop now pleaseFlippinMad: okPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: Ok.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: If you kept going I would’ve closed this and left you to it. Now I’m going to try to give you your answer here. Ok?



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Even though you probably don’t deserve it.FlippinMad: YeahPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: Draw your own conclusions. Look at who she was and extrapolate. She did good she did bad. As time passed yes the bad things might have faded some but the controversial stuff she did might have gotten worse. Extrapolate.FlippinMad: You’re saying that’s what happened? At the end. She did some good and she did some bad but she did something super controversial?Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I am saying *nothing*. I am suggesting that if you are wondering what happened when you couldn’t see then you can make some educated guesses.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: She killed people. She hurt people. She may have played a part in a war over the city. She threatened innocents with bugs and choked more than one person to death or nearly to death by shoving spiders and centipedes down their throats. She killed Alexandria at a time when we needed Alexandria most. 



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: She consorted with rapists terrorists and monsters.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: And because it eneds to be said yes she became a hero. That counts for something maybe. Maybe she had to. Maybe not.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: She was there at the end and whatever she did, nobody will speak of it, at least for now. Fill in the blank



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Now she’s gone and you’re still here.FlippinMad: Gone?



FlippinMad: she retired? Or she’s dead? Gone gone?Point_Me_@_The_Sky: She is *gone*.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: But listen to me. because you made the choices and you carried on when you could’ve stopped and you spat on her and I’m not ignoring that. I’ve been holding back so I can get to it now.



FlippinMad: I’m listeningPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: She was all of those things and she might have still been a better person than you



FlippinMad: …Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Feel shitty? Good. Is it weighing on you or eating at you or making you wonder? Fucking good. That’s the way it should be.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Carry it. Own it. Make allowances for the fact that you were a teenager but don’t you dare excuse it or ignore it



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: If owning it means you assume the worst case scenario? that you pushed her and she took action and that line of action ended in the end of the world being uglier than they needed to be? Fine. Make do.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Maybe things would be better. Maybe they would be worse. Maybe someone else would have taken the same role. Maybe we would all be dead. You might not ever get a clean answer and that might be her justice against youFlippinMad: YeahPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: All this I’m saying? I feel like I can say it because I have my own regrets and misdeeds. I’m trying to own them just like I’m telling you to. I didn’t fucking spit on a girl when she was already having a bad day or make fun of a disabled girl on what should’ve been one of the top ten days of her life but I could probably make a priest’s jaw drop if I were the type to visit a confessional



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I’m not giving you advice I wouldn’t take myself



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Carry it. Take it with you and use it as motivation to make things better. We need a fucking lot of that motivation.FlippinMad: I’m training to be a teacherPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: Then I hope 10x as much that you own this and learn from it



FlippinMad: Yeah



FlippinMad: Thats kind of the plan. I want to anyway but the school turned me down.Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Anything else?FlippinMad: When do I get to put this behind me? When do I get forgiven or get to forgive myself?Point_Me_@_The_Sky: You’re asking me? Never.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I don’t believe in forgive & forget. Not for the things I’ve done. not for what others have done to people I care about. Not for what’s been done to me.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: The moment we forget is the moment we allow those wrongs to be done again.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Forgiveness is the easy way out. Less to carry.FlippinMad: That doesn’t seem fairPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: Villains outnumbered the heroes. Now heroes outnumber villains. Allegedly. People lost everything and they didn’t deserve to. Some people get powers and some don’t. Things are the furthest thing from fair.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Maybe it’s not fair that she’s gone and you’re here.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Maybe you will get the answer about what happened and you’ll feel better and that’ll be unfair because you shouldn’t.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Maybe the opposite is true and no good answer will come out and she’ll be forgotten without tombstone or anything else.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I expect we’ll get the answer and it’ll be an unhappy compromise between the twoFlippinMad: It doesn’t seem fair to yourself I meanPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: I’ll handle me. You handle you. You focus on making sure no girl you teach gets spat on, short girl from the photoshoot.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: It’s easy enough to keep something moving once it’s already moving, but getting it going in the first place is hard. That’s the thing about second chances and fresh starts. It’s a (re)start. You gotta get things moving all over again, the second time around.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Let’s try to make sure things are moving in the right direction. Alright? Deal?FlippinMad: Alright.



FlippinMad: Not quite the response I expectedPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: I had the impression it’s the response you were asking forFlippinMad: You might be right.



FlippinMad: ThanksFlippinMad has left the conversation                                                                                             Daybreak – 1.2                                                                                             I had badly neglected my locker.  I had an office, so my locker in the changing room was more for the things I didn’t use much at all.Bag.  The backpack was light, but it only had the nonperishables in it.  I’d done a few patrols for Gilpatrick over the winter, visiting some of the settlements that were a little further afield, while many of the students were taking Christmas off.  I’d also used it for my fitness test.I set it on the table in the center of the room.  Something to weigh when I was done getting outfitted.  For now, I just needed it out of my locker.  The bag took up the bottom half, the armor took up the upper half.Outfit change.  I couldn’t go out in a skirt and body armor.  I had some self respect.  The pants in my locker were part of an emergency change of clothes, heavier fabric intended for winter and trips to Bet when the weather was bad.I hadn’t put the pants through the wash since having to shovel snow over the winter, but I hadn’t worn them much either.  There was still salt crusting the heels, white against black fabric.  I walked over to the sink and rinsed the worst of the salt off, then rolled up the cuffs a bit so I wouldn’t have wet pants slapping against my ankle.I kicked off my shoes and hiked up the pants so they were under my skirt, then unfastened the skirt.“Victoria,” Gilpatrick said, behind me, a deep male voice in the girl’s change room.  I jumped a little.  “Are you free to talk?”I turned my head.  There wasn’t a door to the girl’s changing room, but there was a solid wall blocking the view.  I could see the edge of Gilpatrick’s arm – he stood with his back to the wall and the changing room.Camisola was in the room too, unpacking and repacking her kits for her bag.  She met my eyes.“I’ll step out,” she said.“Thank you, Cami,” Gilpatrick said.  I pulled my shoes back on and laced them as Cami left the room.Belt.  Holster.  I threaded the belt through my belt loops, careful to position the holster.Cami was apparently out of earshot, because Gil spoke again.  “Thank you, Victoria.”“Give me Jasper,” I said.  “For my squad.”“Jasper?” he asked.  “Why?”Well, that said a lot, didn’t it?“Because I’m paranoid,” I said.  Paranoid on more than one front, but I wouldn’t tell Gilpatrick that.  I had suspicions and his willingness to give me Jasper would tell me things.  “Is anyone else standing outside the door?”“This conversation is just you and me.”“Okay.  I know Jasper, and I’m honestly more worried about the attitudes of the people you gave me than I am about the protest or whatever it is people are going to pull with Bad Apple.”“Jasper’s attitude isn’t great.”“Jasper is a joker and he can be immature, but he can give that five pounds of gun speech because he believes it.  He’s in this because he thinks capes are cool, not because he’s pissed.  Give me one person I know will agree with me.”“I kind of need every senior I can get.  But I’ll give you that.”I bit my lip, thinking as I worked the combination of the safe at the topmost section of my locker.  I pulled out the pistol and holstered it.  I kept my hand there, reminding myself of the weapon’s weight as I tried to figure out how to word my question, and if I wanted to ask it.“Then how about you take some of the angry ones?  The new guys you were giving me.”“That was a quick assessment.”I gathered the pistol magazines and slotted them into the pouch, before setting to attaching the pouch to my leg and belt.  “I don’t want them.  I don’t want to get some people from elsewhere with their own habits and ways of doing things, and have to train them on top of doing this thing.”“Take them, Victoria,” Gilpatrick said.  “They came with good recommendations, they know their stuff, and if it does wind up being a protest, you’ll want the extra bodies.  If it doesn’t, then it doesn’t matter.”“Things are never that simple, Gil,” I said.“Take them,” he said, firm.“You owe me for this,” I said.“I know,” he said.I sighed.Armor.  I pulled my vest from the bottom of the locker.  I saved it for last because once it was on, I wouldn’t be able to bend down or move as easily.  The old name and number was still visible by the impression that had been made in the armor when it had been punched in and painted on.  The steel-wool scrubbing I’d given it hadn’t erased the whole impression.I didn’t know who Cameron was or where they’d ended up, but I wore their armor now.  I tucked the papers in between my chest and the armor, where the straps would help keep them in place.I spoke, “It’s a cushy job, I get to geek out and show off, and I like my office and the access I get to the portal, I don’t want to take that for granted, but you owe me a few already.  This is one more.”“I know,” he said.  “I’ll make it up to you.  I’ve got to run.  Kids to torture.  I’ll send Jasper your way.”“Alright,” I said.  “Do I need my full pack?”“No,” he said.  “No, I wouldn’t do that to you.  Full pack is a torment I reserve for the newbies.”I was glad to put my bag back in the locker.  I heard Gilpatrick walking away, raising his voice to shout orders.I used fingernails to comb my hair back, then began braiding it.  I had to look in the mirror to make sure I’d gotten all of the stray strands.Hi me, I thought, as I made eye contact.How to describe that feeling?  Something resembling relief and a sinking feeling at the same time. It was a small feeling but still one that I would carry with me for the rest of the day.  That day would be a little bit worse because of the moment, but it would feel more stable for the reminder, too.I had a good two years of experience to draw from, in figuring that out.I’d stopped braiding my hair, I realized, and I’d started holding my breath without realizing it.  I exhaled, closed the safe, spun the dial, closed the locker, and walked out onto the floor of the building, resuming the braiding of my hair.Forward.  Breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth.  Moving on with the day.I caught up with Jasper as he joined the group.“I’m driving, apparently,” Jasper said, wangling the keys in front of me.  “And keeping you company.  Gilpatrick explained the situation.”“Good,” I said.  I pointed in the direction of the bus.  We started walking.“You’re friends?” one of the new guys asked.Still braiding, I looked over at Jasper.  “Enhh.”“You can tell she’s really diplomatic,” Jasper said.“Work friends, kind of?” I said.“We don’t hang out,” Jasper said.  “I’m not sure what we’d do if we did.  We don’t have anything in common.”“We got stuck together for jobs and errands enough times we became familiar with each other,” I said.  “We get on okay.  Jasper’s cool.  Just don’t ask him about the tattoo.”“Tattoo?” someone asked.“I’ll explain when we’re driving,” Jasper said, smiling.We reached the bus.  It wasn’t pretty.  A half-size school bus, rust had been mostly scrubbed away and it had received a paint job in black with white sides.  The emergency exit at the back had been redone so it was the main way in and out, and a passenger seat had been added at the front.  There was an area for supplies and bags to be stowed between the wheels at the right side.I wrapped my braid around itself a few times, and tied it there in a slightly messy bun-coil, then climbed up to the passenger seat.  The seniors climbed into the back.  There were a few faces I recognized but couldn’t name, a dozen more that I didn’t recognize and definitely couldn’t name.  I could tell that they were from elsewhere by the fact that the armor they’d brought with them had been painted black, rather than have the white letters scrubbed away.  Twenty-four in all.Jasper took the driver’s seat, starting up the bus immediately.Even parked in the shade, even in September, the heat was such that the seats were uncomfortably hot.  I’d thought about removing my armor once my hands were free, and carrying it by hand, but I decided to keep it on for the extra buffer.Didn’t do anything to spare my ass from the warm faux-leather seat.  I didn’t like being aware of my body to that extent.“Where to?” Jasper asked, rescuing me from my thoughts.“Norwalk-Fairfield span,” I said.“Rural, isn’t that?” Jasper asked.“Last I heard.”Jasper had to almost stand up to get the perspective to see through the open back of the bus.  He reversed out of the lot and took us onto the road.“Maybe you guys can answer.  What’s the deal with stretches and spans?” one of the new guys asked.I turned sideways in my seat, looking back.  Now that I was sitting and looking back at them, they were older, I noted.  Seventeen at a minimum.  “You guys are from one of the denser parts of the city?”“New York Central.  Near the Bet-Gimel portal,” a girl said.One of the two big ones, then.  We’d bled into the areas surrounding the portals.  Brockton Bay had been the first, but we’d had a few in a few major cities and New York was a big one.  The cluster of settlements around the portals in the northeastern US and people’s desire to have ready access to that cluster and the resources, community, information and security it afforded had played a big part in the megalopolis forming.One blob around New York, one blob around the New Brockton settlement, clusters south of New Brockton, near what would or should be Boston, and everything had spread out or extended from there, mostly hugging the coast and connecting to one another.I explained, “We’ve got these long narrow bands of mingled city and agriculture connecting the primary settlement points, to the point it’s hard to say where one thing starts and the other ends.  And instead of building five big houses they’d rather build an apartment building that hosts twenty, which makes things fuzzy with the distinctions of urban and rural.  So we get the ever-expanding megalopolis blob and we can’t figure out what to call it, even though it’s already this monster.”Our progress out of the city center was slow.  Construction.  Endless construction.  Jasper seemed happy to be driving, even at a crawl.“Yeah,” the first guy spoke.“In terms of the bands that rope everything in together, we go by the cities and locations that were there beforehand.  If you look at where Norwalk would be on a map, that’s the name for the region we’re heading to.  If it’s east-west it’s a span.  If it’s north-south it’s a stretch.  But it’s all a part of the city.”“What if it’s both?” someone asked.“Then it’s neither,” Jasper said.  “You just give it a name.”“More accurately, you try to give it a name and end up in a heated, months-long debate about what to call the area, with way too many emotions tied up into things,” I said.The guy from right behind me said, “I don’t see why we can’t just give the individual areas names like they used to have.  If it’s close to Norwalk, then we call it fucking Norwalk.”“Hey,” I said.  I gave a stern look to the guy who’d said it.  “Swearing’s fine, but not if you’re getting heated.  We’re chatting, not getting up in arms.”“Right.  Sorry,” the guy said.  He didn’t look particularly sorry.We picked up speed as we pulled onto a street with less construction.  With the back of the bus open and the windows on either side of Jasper and me rolled all the way down, the wind whipped through the bus.  The city smelled like dust, drywall, and hot pavement.I dangled one arm out the window, moving my fingers and feeling the air moving against them.“It gets complicated,” I said.  “Geography’s slightly different, they’re hardly checking longitude and latitude exactly when we settle in one place or another.  They’re doing what the surroundings allow.  Means the Norwalk we’re going to might actually be between two places, or off to one side.”Jasper chimed in, “I always remember the Norwalk-Fairfield span because it’s close to the portal for Earth N.  N for Norwalk.”“Yeah,” I said.  “I guess that works.”“I’ve got a question for you, though,” he said.“You want to talk about your tattoo idea.”“Yes,” he said.I rolled my eyes.  “Do what you want.”He turned his head so he could talk to the back of the bus while watching the road.  “We’re doing the squad thing, right?  And a lot of us are doing this with the idea we’ll police the capes, or help them out.”“Police them, mostly,” a guy said.“Opinions vary,” Jasper said, “But I don’t want to get sidetracked.  What I’m thinking is, what’s better than a good callsign?  We have nicknames to call each other.  The trouble is getting a good one to stick.”“Opinions on what a good callsign is are going to vary,” I said.“Quiet you,” Jasper said.  “You and I have talked about this and I’ve determined you have no idea what you’re talking about when it comes to this.  You know the cape stuff, sure, but you clearly don’t get this.”“You want to decide your own callsign?” the girl from the back asked.“Jester,” Jasper said.  “And I swear, if people don’t start using it, I’m going to make it happen by getting a tattoo of a jester and ‘fool’ written beneath it, right on my bicep.”The protests, naturally, started rolling in from the rest of the bus.  He couldn’t decide his own callsign, why would he have it say fool if he wanted the callsign to be Jester, why even have it be Jester?I tuned it out, sticking my head out the window.  Jasper tried to sell the rest of the bus on his idea and was very thoroughly shot down.  In this, at least, all was right with the world.  It was a bad idea.  Forty year-old Jasper didn’t need to live with the mistakes of seventeen year-old Jasper.We drove past skyscrapers paneled in gold-tinted glass.  Solar glass, it was supposed to be called.  We drove past parks with the same rough-edged slice of nature that touched the schoolyard back at the high school.  We drove past a lot of construction, and we were lucky that it didn’t slow us down much.“Victoria Dallon.”I’d heard my name.  I was broken from my reverie.  How long had we been driving now?  The city was seemingly unending and I didn’t recognize the landmarks enough to nail anything down.Victoria Dallon.  I looked at myself in the bus’ side view mirror.“What was that?” Jasper asked, while I remained silent.“Name sounds familiar,” the voice said, from the back.  It sounded almost smug, knowing.  “Can’t quite place it.”“That so?” Jasper asked.  “Maybe keep it to yourself, then.”“Is that how this is?”“I think it’s how everything is,” Jasper said.  “Not just this.  When you’re bringing up the past, whoever you’re talking to, there are two likely possibilities. First, it’s good, and we miss the shit out of it, or, second, it’s bad and why would you bring up the bad except to be a tool?”“It could be important,” the guy said.  “It’s good to know who or what we’re dealing with.”“Could be,” Jasper said.  “But I can tell you this.  Gil trusts her.  I trust her.  If you want to know who you’re dealing with, why don’t you start by taking our cue?”There was no response from the back.“Otherwise, if you’re not going to listen to us,” Jasper said, “why are you on our bus?”Again, no response.Then, belated, one of the others uttered a quiet, “Leave it.”Not aimed at Jasper.  My detractor had been about to say something, I took it, and he’d been told to be quiet.  Not the best result, but it seemed to end the line of questioning.I wondered if there was something nice I could do for Jasper, for sparing me having to handle that.I fished the papers out from my vest, smoothing them against my lap.  I glanced out the window.  The city had thinned out, and I could see farms and tent cities further out.We had to be pretty close to our destination now.I twisted around in my seat again, looking at the people in the back.  I could tell by the way one of them held himself, shoulders square, eye contact forced, that he’d been the one to speak out against me.  He studied me like he would an opponent.I addressed them, “When we get there, we stay together.  We’ll have a quick chat with the people in charge, all together.  If the police have orders for us, those are the orders we follow.  If not, I’ll tell you guys to get to work.  You head to the crowd, and you say hi.”“Say hi?”“Mingle.  Show your faces, let people know we’re around.  Ask how they’re doing.  What do they think?  Look for anyone antsy, especially anyone antsy that we’re there.  Don’t engage if there’s trouble.  Let the police know and let me know, and we’ll figure it out.”“I like looping through the crowds,” Jasper said.  “We did that once or twice, when Gilpatrick was calling the shots, last year.  People don’t see the face or the hair, only the uniform.  If you loop back, it looks like there are more of us than there are.”“Give them second thoughts?” the girl from the back asked.“Something like that,” Jasper said.I wrapped up.  “When we get settled and things are going to start, we’ll be keeping eyes out or standing guard, probably.  We regroup before then, we’ll figure out what’s up, and see where we’re needed.”I saw people nod, then turned around in my seat.“Which street?” Jasper asked.“Myrtle.”“I think that’s it down there,” he said.There were still a lot of tents and cubicle houses hereabouts, it seemed.  On the southern side of the main road, to our left, we had apartment buildings, stores, and something that looked like a brand spanking new swathe of city.  On the other side, it was more construction, tents, farm, and the houses that weren’t real houses- more like mock houses made of panels that had been bolted together, like overlarge tents with hard exteriors.We turned away from the main road, into the deeper section of the city.  The community center was made of stone, had a squat clock tower situated on top,  and looked stately, even with the tall buildings surrounding it, many at least as tall as the community center was.  A patch of park with a fountain sat squarely in front of it.School was just getting out, it seemed.  Students were streaming through the area.  They walked through and along the road to the point that we couldn’t get very close.  Many heads turned our way, curious.Jasper found a parking space a block away from the center, and parked there.  Our people climbed out the back while Jasper and I got organized at the front.“Jasper,” I said.“Special orders for me?”“When and if the rest of them are going through the crowd, stay near the front door.  If anyone gets nervous and ducks out, it might be something.”“Should I follow?”“Probably not.  Keep an eye out, let me know if anything happens.”“And why is this a secret from the others?”Because I didn’t trust the others.  They’d been foisted on me, they had clear attitudes, and I was worried that if push came to shove, they might let a troublemaker go if it meant fucking with the capes.“Paranoia,” I said.  I started to climb out of my seat.  “Thanks for the backup back there.  Jester.”Jasper grinned as my face fell.“I’m sorry, but it sounds bad,” I said.  “I can’t make this a thing.”“It sounds bad when you’re saying it as if someone’s pulling your fingernails out while you’re talking.”“They might as well be,” I said.“It’s good,” he said.  “It’s cool.”“It’s against everything I stand for,” I said.  I climbed down from my seat.“It’s great,” Jasper said, from the other side of the bus.  He tossed the keys into the air and caught them.Some of the others were pulling on the armor they’d left off while sitting on the bus.  Once we were set, we moved as a group toward the town hall.The fact that the community center was actually in the center of this neighborhood meant that the foot traffic was heavy.  A lot of it was moving around the crowd that had formed.  A lot of people with signs, but a lot of young and eager eyes.  Kids aged ten to seventeen, all fresh from their first day of school, genuinely interested in their fledgling hero team.No police parked outside, at a glance.  No barricades, either.Inside, it was standing room only.  Cheap plastic chairs were arranged in rows and columns, and there were many places where parent and young child shared chairs.I saw some people up at the front perk up at our appearance, and the crowd parted to let us through.I identified a woman with gray and black hair and a gray suit-dress that the other people up at the front seemed to be standing around.  I approached her.“You’re in charge?” I asked.“I’m the closest thing to someone in charge.  District representative,” she said.  “We don’t have a group like yours here.  You’re all so young.”I kept still, not letting my emotions show.  I felt the sinking feeling again, without the relief, and without the steadiness that I got from seeing myself in the mirror.Not a big thing.  It was like treading water and a hand on my forehead pushing me down, before pulling away.  Surfacing again, finding my equilibrium, realizing how tired I was as I resumed treading water.I was very aware of the eyes on us.“Do you have more outside?” the representative asked.“More… of us?” I asked, finding my composure again.“Yes.”“No.  No we don’t have more outside.”She looked spooked.  More spooked after my ‘no’.“I can’t help but notice that you have no police presence at all,” I said.“We have some, but not many.  It’s the way it is in Norfair span.”“Norfair,” I said, noting the coined name.  “It’s not really a presence, is it?”“No,” she said.  “We didn’t expect this many naysayers.  With this many, they had to have come from outside the community.”The crowd in the room with us looked eager and happy enough.  A few frowns, but rare.  Had it been just this, overlapping conversations, anticipation, bright eyes and parents with kids, maybe a few people ready to raise some pointed questions if given the opportunity, then all would have been well.It wasn’t just them.  The protesters outside were audible, even with stone walls between us and them.  Two angry voices outside, for every one quiet, polite person inside.I didn’t like how much this was stacking up against us.  The police not having much presence, the controversy, the number of protesters.Paranoia again, that I couldn’t help but wonder about the recruits I’d been given.  Forced to take, as it had turned out.Too many things together.“I think we should talk to the capes,” I said.“Please,” the district rep said.She led us into the back room, just behind where the de-facto stage was.  The team of heroes was there, anxious, waiting to be announced and to step out in front of the crowd.Four of them.  Their costumes were close to being clothing, but had just enough stylization to make them something more.  The masks and face-coverings helped to make them more cape-like.Fume Hood did have a hood, as part of a green hooded coat she wore.  Fans were built into the coat, only partially disguised, each of them much like the ones that were built into the back of a computer, and they made her coat, hair, and hood flap.There was a man in a deep purple tank top and skinny pants with glass jutting from his skin at the elbows and hands, his upper face only a craggy mass of glass or jewel-like shards sticking out of flesh, just beautiful enough to not be macabre.A man about my age slouched in a chair, looking dejected.  He had something that looked like small shields over the back of each hand, three large scimitar-like blades jutting from the back of each shield like they were oversize claws.  He wore a top that showed his muscular stomach, with shorts that reached his knees.  A two-part icon was displayed on chest and belt buckle.The last was a woman in overalls, muscular, with hair shorter than most of the boys in my troupe, something that looked like thick paint slashed across her eyes and nose, and covering her arms up to the elbows.  The paint was black at the very edges, where it was thinner, but pure white elsewhere.  Her eyes were black from corner to corner.“Great,” the woman with the paint said, sarcastic.  “Just what we needed.”“We’re here to help,” I said.“We might need it,” Fume Hood said.“Do you know who’s after you?” I asked.  “Or what’s going on?”She shook her head.“I might be being paranoid, but this feels off,” I said.“A lot of little things,” Fume Hood said.  “Crystalclear’s getting a bad vibe.”I nodded.  I looked at the man with the glass chunks where his nose, eyes, brow and scalp should be.“Have you considered canceling the event?” I asked.“We were actively debating it before you came in,” the man in purple said.  “We’re split.”“Can we break the tie?” I asked.They exchanged glances.The painted woman scowled, “You can.”The man with the claws stood abruptly, shoving his chair to the ground in the process, before stalking off.“Okay,” the painted woman said, again.  She looked at the district rep.  “We’re sorry.  Can you have them disperse?  Tell the protesters they win.”The rep nodded, hurrying from the room to where the people were seated.“Death knell for our group,” the painted woman said.“Maybe.  Probably,” Fume said.  She looked at Crystalclear.  “Feeling better?”“No,” he said.Fume nodded at that.“Would you stick around?” Crystalclear addressed us.  “I wouldn’t mind the backup, if you’re here to help, and I have the sense this is going to get worse before it gets better.”“Gut feeling sense or… power sense?” I asked.I could hear the commotion as people started to leave.  I could hear the complaining.  Even before he answered, my gut feeling sense was that he wasn’t wrong.“The latter,” Crystalclear said, corroborating.                                                                                             Daybreak – 1.3                                                                                             This was the point in time that I would have liked to be able to take to the skies.  Information was important, and if I didn’t have surveillance cameras, I would have been pretty content with a bird’s eye view of the scene.I clenched one fist, cracking my knuckles, before wrapping my other hand around it, cracking them again for good measure.I turned to look at the people from the patrol.  “Set up around the building.  Watch what’s going on outside, stay in touch, report anything unusual.  Jasper?  Hang back.”The others turned to go, some looking back at the capes one last time before leaving.  Interest, other things.“Can’t hurt,” the painted lady said.“I’m Victoria,” I said.  “That’s Jasper.  I know Fume Hood from the notes we got, and I caught Crystalclear’s name.”“Longscratch is the one who just left,” the painted lady said.  “I’m Tempera.”“Thanks,” I said.  “Good to meet you.  Crystalclear, can you fill me in on your power?  What are you getting?”“I see through everything,” Crystalclear said, tapping the chunk of crystal that stood out from the lower edge of his eye socket.  “As if everything was crystal.  I’ve learned there’s a lot of nuance to it.  A little bit of seeing into the past, a little bit of seeing into the future, a little bit of a sense of people’s focus.”“He has a blaster power too,” Tempera said.  “Goes through walls and the ground.  Synergy.”“I really hope it doesn’t come to actually using that.  Right now, I’m more interested in how this points to possible trouble in the future,” I said.“Uh,” Crystalclear said.  He looked around.  “It’s hard to explain because it’s not a sense anyone else has.  Say I was looking at a wall.  It looks like a chunk of clear glass and the light catches at the edges and corners and they’re highlighted.”My eye roved over the room.  It was reminiscent of a teacher’s lounge, but it had less of an emphasis on the lounging.  Coffee cups sat on windowsills and there were places where furniture had been stacked once, and the furniture had been moved out into the open room at the front of the building, where all the people were or had been seated.  Glass cases with model buildings had been brought inside and carefully stacked against the wall.  A long table that might have served as a conference table was folded up in one corner.I tried to imagine it like Crystalclear was describing it.  A sketch in three dimensions, only the lines visible.  “I follow you so far.”“The edges of walls and floor are usually clear, crisp, and closer to white.  Solid objects don’t change, so there’s no reason for that to change.  It’s blurred.  Blue tinted.”“Future sight,” Tempera added.  “Past-sight is red, future-sight is blue.  Like the doppler.”Crystalclear went on, “In the future, that wall vibrates.  Similar effect with people, but they move around more.  I see you all as streaks, shifting around, white-edged where you’re resting in present.  There is refraction and some fractures around people’s heads, representing focus and kind of thinking.”“That gets blueshifted redshifted?” I asked.  “It’s not displayed as color?”Crystalclear nodded his head.  It was a motion made more weighty by the heavy growth at the top of his head.  “Not as color.  It’s… edges to the light around them, sharpness and softness, distortions like how you can look at a glass of water with a straw in it and the straw isn’t straight, or you see multiple straws.   The worst breaks in focus look like grooves or outright breaks.  A lot of people here are going to be distorted soon.  Or were.  They’re leaving and they’re clearing up.”His head turned as he focused on things on the other sides of the walls.“What about, say, Jasper?”  I asked.“Hey,” Jasper said.  “Use yourself as an example.”Crystalclear looked at Jasper.  “Hard to say.  Whatever it is, it’s small or it’s distant.”Crystalclear glanced over at Tempetera and Fume Hood.  “Not just him either.  It doesn’t give me much to work with.”He turned his attention to me.I cut right to asking my next question, before he could comment.  “Do you see the direction of it?  Anything big and blue that’s suggesting a major thing coming in sometime in the future?  One section of the building that gets hit harder?”He shook his head.  “I’d have to see it before I saw how things were around it, and even then there’s nuance.”“You’re thinking of a parahuman or weapon?” Tempera asked.“I have no idea,” I said.  “If I was a civilian with an issue, and I was going after capes, I’d go big or I wouldn’t try at all.  If we’re talking something that shakes this whole community center… bomb?  Parahumans are definitely possible, except I’m not sure how using parahumans squares with the sentiment toward parahumans.”Fume Hood spoke up from the background.  “Set us against each other, they benefit either way.”“Could be,” I said.  I paused.  “As soon as the crowd has dispersed enough, I want to get you guys clear of here.  Do you have a decent mover power to use?”“Longscratch does,” Tempera said.“Not a mass mover power, is it?” I asked.  At the negation, I turned to Jasper.  “Can you bring the bus close?  If the crowd is thinning out, you should be able to pull right up to the door.  Take someone with you, if we’re delayed, do like I discussed earlier.  Keep an eye out.”Jasper saluted, turning to go.The bus wasn’t elegant, but hopefully it would take us away from vulnerable civilians or areas.“How is Longscratch?” Tempera asked Crystalclear.“He’s fine.  Stalked off.  He’s keeping an eye out for trouble,” Crystalclear said.  He pointed up and off to one side.  On an upper floor, it seemed, or on the roof.“That’s how he is.  I won’t bother him.  I’ll go talk to the district representative, instead, if that’s alright,” Tempera said, looking my way.“If the coast is clear,” I said.“Most people have cleared out of the main hall,” Crystalclear said.  “The ones who are hanging back seem like the types to be doing it for good reason.  Parents with kids, teenagers hoping to get a glimpse of the heroes they came to see.”“That’s positive,” Tempera said.  “I’ll give them a glimpse then.  Thank you, Victoria.”“I’m going to get a glass of water and get my head straight,” Fume Hood said.  “I’ll catch up with the rest of you in a minute.”“Don’t go running off,” Tempera said.  “Get your water, take a minute, but come back after.  I don’t want you to throw yourselves to the wolves.”“I won’t,” Fume Hood said.“Or whatever variant on that plan you might be thinking.  I can see you trying to lead the enemy way from us,” Tempera said.“I won’t,” Fume Hood said, annoyed.“It wouldn’t work anyway,” Crystalclear added.“Your future sight telling you that?” Fume Hood asked, her annoyance becoming something more bitter.“I don’t see the future like that.  You know that.  But I do know that they’re mad at all of us.  Our fortunes are intertwined, and their hate is- it’s not very targeted.”“Not hate,” I said.They looked my way.“It’s easy to see it as hate, but I’ve been thinking about it a lot,” I said.  “It’s not that.  It’s blame.”“Blame,” Fume Hood said.“I don’t think it’s a reflection on you.  Humanity is hurt.  It’s hurt in a way that makes it a little bit animal.  Reactive.  They’re snapping at any target that presents itself, because the hurt is fresh.  They’re taking that hurt and they’re looking for anyone they can put it onto.  You…”I trailed off.“We presented ourselves,” Tempera said.“Not in a bad way,” I said.  “This isn’t your fault.”“I’ll get my water,” Fume Hood said, curt.  She didn’t wait for a response, heading into the adjacent room, further from the front of the building.Once Fume Hood was gone, Tempera nudged Crystalclear.  “Keep an eye on them?”Crystalclear nodded.Tempera gave me a nod before stepping out the door.“Is Fume Hood going to be okay?” I asked.“Who knows?” he asked.“Trouble still isn’t imminent?”Crystalclear shook his head.  “At least fifteen minutes off.  I’m thinking we should go get a better vantage point, see if I can’t spot any troublemakers.”“Watch out for my guys,” I said.“Watch out for what?”I glanced at the door.  “Blame.”“Got it,” he said.  “I shouldn’t stick my neck out or draw attention to myself, then?”“Not unless I’m there.”“And where will you be?” he asked.I looked at the other door.  The one Fume Hood had taken.   “I was thinking I’d get a glass of water.  Unless you think that would be overstepping.”He looked in the direction Fume Hood had gone.  His voice was soft as he said, “I have no fucking idea.”“I’ll catch up with you,” I said, clapping a hand on his shoulder in passing.The area adjacent to the conference room was a kitchen, set up with multiple stovetops and long counters.  Catering-focused, at a glance.  The stoves were of different makes and models.  Scavenged.Fume Hood was standing by the sink, a glass of water in hand.  She looked at me, her eyes barely visible with the surrounding mask and the overhanging hood.“Can I grab some water?  The bus ride was warm, even with the windows rolled down.”She filled a glass, then slid it along the counter to me, so it met me halfway as I made my approach.“What was the plan?” I asked.“The plan?”“Corporate?  Sponsored?  Ideology-driven?  There are a lot of those nowadays.  Move forward, rebuild, hold to the past, unity in strength, religion…”“No ideology,” she said.  “No sponsorship.  No business partnerships.  I’m not even sure what we would have done about the money.”“That can be hard,” I said.  I drank my water.“It wasn’t supposed to be easy.”I finished my water, then approached the sink to get more.  Fume Hood turned around, leaning against the counter just beside me.She said, “It was community focused.  Serving the area, hometown heroes like the old days.  I thought of it as community service, in more than one way.”“I like that,” I said.She shrugged.  “I’m not sure if there’s anything to like about it.”“It’s a good idea.  It sounds positive.  Maybe it’s worth trying again later.”“It won’t come together again like this later.  Tempera is pretty good at this whole thing, and she needs to do the cape stuff, so she’ll find a team to join.  Crystalclear will get poached because decent thinker powers are in demand.  Longscratch… I don’t know why he’s even here.  Tempera suggested it to him, for some reason, he accepted for some reason.  He’s upset it fell apart.  Next time, he’ll just say no.  He’ll steer clear so he doesn’t have reason to get upset again.”“Mover psychology?” I asked.“I don’t know about that stuff.  I just know he’s a weird mix of wants and needs and he’s really cool when things are good and he’s impossible to understand when they aren’t.  Which they aren’t.”“Sorry,” I said.“You wouldn’t be sorry if you knew,” she said.  She stood taller, stretching a bit.  She tossed the empty glass between her hands.  “It’s my fault.”“You orchestrated this?” I asked.“I hurt a pregnant lady and she lost her child and I don’t even feel that bad about it,” Fume Hood said.  “I turned myself in, but it was because people thought I’d become a PR problem for capes in general.  I’d run out of friends and places to run to.  It seemed like the only way to get things to cool down.”The glass smacked against each of her hands as she tossed it back and forth.I drank my water, still watching her.“I’m pissed,” she said.  “People are making such a big deal over this, and I can’t bring myself to see it their way.  It was an accident.  I told the civilians to sit and stay put, and this stupid-”She stopped there, clenching her fist.Fume Hood continued, “-stupid fucking woman.  She ran right to where I was shooting out a display window, gets knocked on her ass, breathes in the gas.”“I wonder what she was thinking,” I said.“I’ve wondered that every day since.  I’m mostly caught between thinking she wanted to get hurt and lose the baby, it was so blatant, or that she thought the broken display window was an escape route, even though there were others she could have run for,” Fume Hood said.  “I was so pissed.  I shouted at people to take her outside and get her some fresh air, even though I knew it made everything harder with the robbery.  They’d contact authorities, we’d have to protect ourselves, whatever.  I thought I was pretty fair.  She got medical attention and shit.”“Could have been worse,” I said.“I shouldn’t have pulled that robbery at the mall.  I know that.  But it’s not one of my big regrets.  Her being a stupid fucking idiot isn’t one of them either, obviously.”“You turned yourself in after that.”“The heat got too much, like I said.  And- and I was tired, you know?”Her voice had cracked on the ‘tired’.She sounded tired now.“It had been years, trying to get by.  A lot of it was fun.  The drugs, the robberies and mercenary work, the adventure, new places and really interesting people.  Some shitty people, lots of scary people, but they were always interesting.  Capes are interesting in a way you probably wouldn’t get if you didn’t know any for real.”“I grew up with capes,” I said.She stopped passing the glass from hand to hand, holding it in both instead.  “Did you?  Huh.”I shrugged.  My glass was empty.  I put it on the counter and, finger on the inside, spun it in a circle, the bottom rattling on the metal countertop.She continued, “Well, all I know is, the crime stuff started to feel like work.  The drugs stopped feeling like they were a plus and started feeling like they were something I had to do.  I was never addicted, I never craved it, I never had withdrawal after.  This analogy I’ve been thinking of is it’s like I had to go to the bathroom every half hour and who wants to do that, you know?  Who wants to keep interrupting their day for something they aren’t even enjoying anymore?”“No idea,” I said.  “But I can see what you’re saying.”“The cool people started dropping away.  A couple dead, others just stopped being cool.  High people are really boring to be around.  So like a genius, I thought hey, let’s just go to prison.  I made a deal.  I wanted a bit of an education, training at some job or another, safety, I didn’t want to be stuck in there too long.”“How’d it work out?”“Deal worked out fine.  Judge agreed, heroes agreed, it was one less parahuman on the streets that people were really upset about.  Jail isn’t fun, but it was what I needed, I think.”“Shows character, I think,” I said.  “Realizing where you were at, where you were headed, and changing course.”“I don’t have character,” Fume Hood said.  “It was selfish and self-centered.  It was me, me, me, I’m bored, I’m done with the drugs, I’m scared of being caught by angry people, I want this deal, I want some education.  I don’t and I never cared about that pregnant idiot.”She met my eyes as she said that last bit.Challenging me.I spun the glass on the countertop again.  “The community service hero stuff?”“Me, me, me,” she said, her voice quiet.  “I thought it gave me the best chance of dodging any lingering heat.  Ha.”I took my finger away from the glass.  It spun in a circle before settling with a rattle.“I don’t buy it,” I said.She shrugged, tossing the glass into the air, catching it.“You said before that you have real regrets,” I said.  “And you can call yourself selfish, but I think the dots connect here.  Your reasons, your regrets.”She tossed the glass into the air, caught it.She did it a few more times.“We should go,” she said.  “Check on the others.  Do our part.”“We should,” I said.The water from the faucet we’d used deposited a fat droplet on the metal bottom of the large sink, producing a hollow sound.  Neither of us budged.“I got friends into the soft drugs and I egged them on instead of stopping them when they got themselves into the harder stuff.  I regret that, I turned myself in for that, even though I was supposed to be serving the punishment for the pregnant woman.  For other stuff, more on that level.  I turned myself in for the” -she took a deep breath, as if to signify magnitude- “years of being a low to mid tier nusiance.  For being tiresome.  And because I was tired of it.”“I’m not a priest,” I said.  “I don’t have the power to say some words and absolve you.  It’s up to society to decide how angry they are and how they come to terms with it.  It’s up to you to decide how willing you are to face your deeds.  When it comes to me… I can say I respect a lot of what you’re saying.   I definitely think you should own up more to what you did to that woman, stop calling her stupid.  It’s not a point in your favor.”Fume Hood nodded.“Honestly,” I said, “I really like the community hero idea.  I’d really like you to try it again, after a bit.  For that to be your way of working through it all, from influencing your friends to hurting that woman.  We’re dealing with blame, not hate, and blame finds a place to roost eventually.  There has to be another shot at making this happen.”“Blame seems like too small a word for what Crystal was saying.”“Blame can be big,” I said.  “Blame has led to the ruin of nations.”She nodded.  “That sort of helps, actually.”“I’m glad to have sort of helped.”“Blame can become something else, given time, can’t it?” she asked.“It can,” I admitted.  “I’m spooked at the idea it will.  For now, just… be a hero,” I said.  “Don’t walk away from this sort of thing for good.”“You guys keep saying stuff to me, like, don’t run off, don’t sacrifice yourself, be a hero, as if it’s implied I’ve got ideas I haven’t said out loud.”“You’re a self-described shitty person and an ex-villain.  We’re not allowed to be suspicious?” I asked.That got a half-smile out of her.“Come on,” I said.  “I’m getting worried about my guys and I’ll get yelled at by my boss if I leave them to their own devices for too long.”“This is your thing, then?” she asked.  She followed me as I left, setting her glass next to where I’d left mine.  “You joined the junior-PRT to convince shitty people to be less shitty?”“On the most basic level, I got into this because capes are what I know,” I said.“Because you grew up with them.”“Yeah, but keep that under the lid for now,” I said.  “I’m not broadcasting it to the world.”“Lips zipped.”I pushed the door open, stepping back into the now-empty conference room.  “I want to help.  I could have helped with construction or farming or whatever else, but like I said-”“Capes are what you know.”“Yeah.  I knew so many great people and I don’t know if all of them made it, but I want to be in a position to help them through whatever comes next.  I want to figure things out, because the lack of answers is what fucks us over, and fucks them over.  I want to talk to people like you, if you happen to be on the fence, so maybe you land on the side where you’re more likely to help out those really cool, great people.”“I thought you junior-PRT kids were all about training so you can go after the monsters.”She’d created a hard green sphere, the size of a billiard ball.  She tossed it between her hands as she had the glass.  It smacked against each palm.I answered her, “Don’t get me wrong, but I have pretty strong feelings when it comes to the monsters.  I’m pretty far from being okay with them.”She gave me a sidelong glance while opening the door to the main room.“But I don’t think you’re one of them,” I said.  “Sorry, but you’re safe from me.”She threw the ball to the right, but instead of smacking into her palm, it curved in the air, orbiting her hand in a long ellipse as a moon might a planet.“What a relief,” she said.  She was smiling a bit more, now.The smile faltered a bit more as we faced the situation at hand.Some of the police had come inside.  My guys were standing near the windows, looking out.  Some were talking to the police.A share of the crowd had remained behind.  Community leaders, possibly.Fume Hood hung back as I approached them all.“You’re in charge?” a police officer asked.  He had a mustache.  It bothered me, because I’d never really got mustaches, barring the truly awesome ones.  This was lip decoration, bristly and at odds with how his hair was combed back and close to his head.“Yessir.  I’m Victoria, I take my orders from Instructor Gilpatrick at Wayfair High School.”“They said you told them to follow our orders?”“Or to keep a lookout for trouble.  There’s still people here?  Is there a problem?”“No,” the officer said.  He sighed.  “I don’t know what to do with them.  Yours or with the others.  Situation seems to be resolving itself, but the teenagers in uniform are insisting it isn’t.”“The capes say it isn’t,” I said.  “I’d believe them.”“Huh,” he said.I took a deep breath, exhaling slowly, while the officer took a look around at the situation.“Haven’t you talked to them?” I asked.  “The capes?”“A little bit,” he said.  “Not recently.  I don’t really know how.”“They’re people,” I said.  “Capable people who want to help.”“They’ve got the eye thing, and the masks.  One doesn’t have eyes at all,” he said.  “He has these crystals.  He pulled one out of the top of his head earlier, and it made a wet sound.  It was in so deep it should’ve been inside his brain.”“They’re people,” I said, again.“It’s disconcerting,” the man said.I wanted to say things to that, but I bit my tongue.  I could hardly criticize when I’d been talking to Fume Hood.I’d just- I’d really hoped for better.“If you need me to be a liason, let me know,” I said.  He didn’t give me an immediate response, so I called out to the squaddies.  “Get back from the windows, guys!  The working theory is a bomb, heavy impact, cape power, or something like an earthquake, and you don’t want your nose pressed against the glass when it comes!”They shuffled back.“Bomb?” the officer asked.“Yeah,” I said.  “Can you get everyone here clear of danger?”“To somewhere inside or further outside?”I looked around.  Crystalclear and the others hadn’t come to find us, so I was left to imagine the danger wasn’t super imminent.  Inside posed risks.I didn’t like making the calls, but I said, “Outside, but hurry it up.  If there’s any remaining crowd outside, get them further back or get them to go.”“Alright,” he said.  “Makes sense.”He whistled for the attention of his people and the crowd that had gathered closer to the front door.While he handled that, I looked at the others, “Where’s Jasper?”“Still out there.  He has Mar and Landon with him.  The crowd is in their way.”I hurried to approach the window.  I could hear a commotion behind me, as others entered the room, but my focus was on the commotion outside.  My view was briefly blocked by the cops and the people they were leading outside and across the street to our left, away from both the building and the lingering protesters.“Victoria,” Crystalclear said, behind me.  He was with a small few members of the community center staff, including the district rep, and he had Longscratch and Tempera with him.He would be here because trouble was imminent.“How soon?” I asked.“Two impacts in a couple of minutes.  Six or seven.”Two.  Six or seven minutes gave us a window to act.I watched the scene in progress through the window.  Jasper wouldn’t make it to the front door in two or three minutes.  Some of the protest had dispersed, but a lot of it had spread out from the square of grass, sidewalks, fountain and trees just in front of the community center, dotting the streets.  A share of them occupied the street Jasper needed to come down to reach us, and a lot of them had their back to him.  He honked, not for the first time, and one of them gave him the finger.“I’m going to help Jasper out, get us our bus so we can drive out of here without being mobbed,” I said.  “Is there a side door?”Crystalclear pointed at what would have been the south side of the building, to my left.“Go there, stay clear of windows.  Protect my people, keep them clear of danger.  The moment there’s real trouble, they’re just high schoolers and should be treated as such.  High schoolers- you guys protect Fume Hood.  Protect the capes.  Be good.”“Do you need help?” Tempera asked.She couldn’t help.  She would cause more problems than she fixed, being in costume.No.  I shook my head, heading to the front door.Was this an emergency?  Yes.Did I like using my power?  No.I marched toward the bus, glaring at the first person in my way.  I activated my aura.“Move,” I said, and I pushed out with my power.  Heads turned, noticing.  Maybe they would put their finger on why they’d noticed.  Maybe not.  I was nudging, here.I could see the man’s reaction.  He took a partial step back.I stepped it up a notch, not with more use of my power, but by raising the volume of my voice.  “Out of the way!”He got out of the way.  That and me drawing nearer made it easier for the next person to come through.“Bus!” I called out to Jasper.  “Get moving!  Side door to the right of the building!  South side!”People looking back at the bus and back to me had more pressure to deal with.  That was easier.  They got clear of the bus’ path.The one who had given Jasper the finger, though, he had just a little bit more to prove.  I put my hands on him.  I pushed him, and he resisted.I pushed him with my aura, small, closer to center, a pulse of intimidation just for him, to break his posture and resolve.  My hands pushed him the rest of the way.  He landed on his ass.He wasn’t wholly out of the way, but Jasper was able to drive up on the sidewalk.  His door was open and the stairs leading up to his seat were there.  I hopped up, grabbing the bar that the driver used to climb into the seat, hanging off the side.“Things okay?” he asked.“They’re about to be not okay,” I said.  “We’ve got four or five minutes, probably.  I want to be gone by-”Jasper’s two passengers, Mar and Landon, were at the window behind Jasper’s seat.  They were looking out and over my shoulder.I turned to look.  In the crowd, a man was standing there, shuddering.  People were backing away from him.He wore a black hooded sweatshirt and black pants, and he stood so the hood hid his face.  His arms were at his side, vibrating.  Head, arms, body and legs all moved like he had a paint shaker wedged up his ass, moving more violently by the second.Building up to something.“Take cover!” I shouted the words.Some people did.  They ran, they sprinted for mailboxes, for trees.  But it was too open an area for everyone to find something.I threw up my personal forcefield, shielding Jasper, my arm out toward the windows the other two were looking at.The man in the crowd exploded, showering the crowd with chunks of bone, flesh, and a mist of blood.  More than should have been contained in a human body.  Some of the windows in the bus had cracked, and my forcefield was down.The people over the square of grass, around the fountain, on the sidewalks and the streets surrounding the explosion all stood, calm.Streaked with blood, they looked around, every single head turning left, then turning right.  All in unison.“Drive,” I said.Jasper stomped on the gas.Further up the street, the cops that had been evacuating people from the building and across the road were standing near the street.  They’d been touched by the gore-explosion, and now they were drawing their guns.“Don’t hit them!”“I’m not going to hit them!” Jasper called out, swerving so the side and then the rear of the bus was between us and them.It hadn’t been five or six minutes yet.  It couldn’t have been.  The building hadn’t been hit yet.I climbed up higher, standing on the headrest of Jasper’s seat to reach a higher point on the bus, looking over the roof.Where?The worst possible location.An eighteen wheeled logging truck was coming down the road.  The front had been reinforced with metal braces.  It was coming from the direction of the water, only four hundred or so feet of road between the waterline they’d started near and the community center, but it was going full speed, straight for the side door.“Fuck me.”  Jasper’s voice.Even if Crystalclear saw-“Hit it!” I called out.“What?  Are you insane?”“Hit it!  The others are waiting on the other side of the door!”I scrambled to get in position.“Trusting you,” Jasper said, and the bus picked up speed.You shouldn’t, I thought.I had one partial glimpse of the inside of the truck.Multiple costumes.And then the impact.                                                                                             Daybreak – 1.4                                                                                             There was no way to process the series of collisions that followed me hurling myself down between the logging truck and the school bus.  My focus was on deflecting the impact, clawing at the logging truck with everything I had to try to put it off course, before the bus made contact and hopefully moved it further.  As the two vehicles came together, I extended my whole body, trying to push them apart in a way that would keep the collision from being the head-on sort that might kill Jasper.In no particular order, the school bus hit the logging truck, the logging truck  hit the school bus and the wall, and I, my forcefields down, hit the ground rolling.I came to a stop and lay where I was, face down.  I felt the sting of the scrapes where I’d come into contact with the road, and waited for the real pain to start.  I wanted to know where the real damage was before I moved the wrong part and made it worse.  My ears rang from the sharp noises and impacts.  Playing dead helped, too, because the villains were rousing, opening the door of the truck cab, glass tinkling down to the street below.“What the hell?” someone asked.  They were younger- probably teenager.  I couldn’t pinpoint if they were male or female.“Are you okay?” a deeper voice asked.  The nature of the voice made me think brute.  “Any injuries?”“I think I have whiplash,” the teenager said.  “I wasn’t expecting that.  What the hell?”“You were intercepted before impact.  It looks like teenagers in uniform.  With a bus.”“I can see that,” the teenager said.“You missed the side door you were supposed to drive through.”“I can see that too,” the teenager said.“I can’t tell what you’re looking at, Blindside.  Let me know if you need help.  Snag?”“I’m fine,” was the response, a rasp.  I heard metal creak.“Your arm isn’t,” the teenager said.  They would be Blindside, going by what the Brute had said.“I’m fine.”I heard the sound of someone hopping down to land on the street, not all that far away from me.  Metal struck the road shortly after.I only saw a glimpse of him.  Work boots, a long coat that hung down low enough that it almost looked like his legs were only two feet long, and arms long enough that his wrists made contact with the ground.  The hands rested flat on the road, fingers splayed.  He wore gauntlets.I wanted to see something more than just his feet, but as I started to raise my eyes, looking through the hair that had come loose from my braid, my eyes were forced down, until they were staring at the road.  I heard the scrape of another person’s feet as they climbed down from the truck to the street.“My fucking neck,” Blindside said.  The person in question.Try as I might, I couldn’t look at them.  My eyes and head refused to cooperate and do what was necessary to put them in my field of vision.“Don’t complain,” said the Brute.“You weren’t on the truck.  You don’t get to tell me what I can or can’t complain about.  Fuck, I wasn’t expecting that hit.  Did both K.C. and Nursery fuck up?”“The timing was wrong,” a woman said.  Nursery, I assumed.There were so many of them.  The Brute, Snag, Blindside, Nursery, and K.C.- I really hoped that K.C. was the mass-master I’d seen in the crowd.  If they weren’t, then there were six of them in total.  Six and the crowd that the exploding parahuman had control of.We had four capes on the inside, me, and a bunch of high schoolers, some of whom had guns.  None of whom, cape or student, that I wanted involved in this conflict.The five or six attacking capes wouldn’t be attacking like this if they weren’t sure they could win.“Don’t be stupid,” Snag said, his voice a rough growl, volume raised.He wasn’t talking to me.  He was directing that at Jasper and the other two.Drive away, I thought, willing Jasper to think the same.  Be okay, drive away.  Leave me.I heard the chugging of the bus, the battered engine protesting as the vehicle started to reverse, pulling away.At the edge of my Blindside-limited field of vision, Snag’s metal, long-fingered hand lifted from the ground.  He leaped toward the bus without making the movements necessary to jump.  I didn’t want to move my head and risk being seen just to see him land, but I heard the metal-on-metal sound, the impact of a heavy body on the hood.Every set of eyes, mine excepted, had to be on him and the retreating bus.  It was an opening, and it was an opening our side opted to use.  The side door of the building opened without a sound.  Fume Hood and Crystalclear were in the doorway.Crystalclear threw a chunk of crystal at the ground, and the chunk passed through without sound or apparent impact.  Fume Hood had six green orbs with her, all around her hand.  She sent one out in the direction of the bus, then, a moment later, sent a second.  Both exploded, off to one side.Crystalclear’s shot passed through walls.  Tempera had let me know that.  Apparently, it needed to pass through walls, or the ground in this case.  He’d thrown it into the ground, and a moment after Fume had released her two shots, both landing, Crystalclear’s shot emerged from the ground, an explosion of vapor, glass splinters, and fragments of road.One of the villains, the Brute, only laughed.Fume Hood paused, her four orbs around her hand.  Her head was turned so she could only see me with one eye- Blindside’s power was limiting them there.Through the hair that had fallen over my face, I could see Fume Hood look at me.  Making eye contact.I couldn’t see the villains, so I knew the action was risky.  I had to hope they were more focused on her than on me.I raised my head up and  motioned for her to go, moving one hand, swiping my fingers toward her.The pattern was much the same as with her first shot.  One shot, then firing the remaining three all at once.  One to gauge how it would fly, then the rest to deliver the hit.They slammed the door shut, just before the three near-simultaneous explosions.  The detonations were small and sharp, and produced a wind that blew my hair away from my face.  I held my breath.The Brute laughed again.I really didn’t want to pick a fight with four capes at once.  The bus was gone, the door was shut.“This is going to slow us down,” the Brute said.“You don’t have to sound so happy about it,” Blindside said.The Brute chuckled, and climbed down from the roof of the truck, and in the doing, he put himself between me and Blindside.  It blocked my view of Blindside, and it gave me a chance to get a glimpse of him.  The ground smoked around where his boots touched pavement, and the smoke solidified into formations that looked like branches and twists of metal, all in an ashen white-grey.  His entire body was made of the stuff, as if he wore armor made of white-grey bandages made solid and immobile by resin, all of the ends curling up and away from him in horns or branches.I knew him, even just seeing his legs.  Or I knew of him, to be precise.  Yeah, based on what I knew of Fume Hood’s group, they might be outclassed.The big guy was the Lord of Loss.  There were two ways a cape could go with a name like that.  The most obvious was to fuck up just once, and forever after have people wondering out loud what he was thinking, taking a name like that.  Being called a loser.The other way was to succeed and ascend the name, to take that name and make it a title.  The Lord of Loss had managed that.He had been one of the villains in a big city on the West coast, and now he was one of the villains running a settlement on one of the corner worlds.  Was it Earth-N?  Not far from here, if it was.  He wasn’t top tier, as capes went, but he was A-list.He was a Brute with Breaker flavor.  He cloaked himself in abstract forms, with a set selection.  I knew one resembled a bird, which he would have been using to fly alongside the truck.  He was versatile, big, strong, and his breaker power multiplied his efforts over time.  That multiplication played into how he flew, how he grew, and back before Gold Morning, a few occasions where he’d been able to slug away at a bank vault until he’d torn it open, or even drag a smaller vault away with him.He turned his attention toward me, turning around and approaching me as the others backed away from the cloud of gas.  My chin jerked toward my chest as Blindside stepped out to the side, back in my field of view.I would’ve rather had just about anyone else step close enough for me to get my hands on them.  It had to be the guy I couldn’t take out of the fight.“Miss,” Lord of Loss said.  “Are you injured?”I couldn’t pretend to be unconscious- I’d just moved because of Blindside.  I settled for an inarticulate, small moan.Lord of Loss knelt beside me.  “Can you walk?”I shook my head, keeping the movement small.“Is it because your back is hurt?  Can you feel my hand, here?” he asked.I felt his hand touch my knee.I nodded, again, small.  I screwed up my face, feigning more pain than I was in.I didn’t like this.  I didn’t like being so close to the guy, I didn’t like the scrutiny, the eyes on me, the attention.  I didn’t like being treated like I was an invalid.  I didn’t like suppressing my forcefield and aura.I didn’t like being still.It was easier to keep my composure if I was moving, doing.“Blindside,” Lord of Loss said.  “Watch her.”“What?”“You were always going to be the lookout, with Kingdom Come helping.  We stick to the plan.  We’re going in, we’ll get our target, you’ll be the lookout, and you’ll look out for this junior soldier while you’re at it.”“Pain in the ass.”“Plans change,” Lord of Loss said.  “You’ll learn that sooner or later.  Our clients hired us to capture an ex-villain who made a bystander lose her child.  I don’t think they’d be pleased if we let another bystander get hurt while we carry out the task.”“Yeah, no, I get it.  Just go.  Let’s get this over with.”“Keep an eye out for the vehicle with the other soldiers.  They drove in Kingdom’s direction.  If they can’t get through or around, they might come back.”“I get it.  It’s fine.  Go.  I can handle my shit.”My eyes had closed, because it kept my head from being jerked around as Blindside kept compelling me to move to avoid seeing them, but I could tell when Lord of Loss moved away, as the bulk of his body ceased blocking the light of the sun above us.“Snag,” Lord of Loss said.  “Any injury?”I heard a cough.  “No.”“Then go with Nursery,” Lord of Loss said.  He paused.  “Kingdom Come?”Another pause.“It’s time.  Move in,” Lord of Loss said.  “I can’t go inside, so I’ll take the roof, I’ll watch the other sides of the building, and do what I can to help.”I cracked my eyes open.  Nursery and Snag were walking up to the door.  Lord of Loss was breaking into pieces, his arms spreading out as the wispy smoke formed into the ‘feathers’ of his wings.  He wasn’t fast at all as he started to flap, lifting off the ground.That would be the downside of his breaker power.  It let him hit harder every time he hit something, and that included the beats of wing against air, but it took time.Still, it let him move in the direction of the roof.  He paused, circling, as Snag raised one long arm and pushed at the door.  White paint leaked around the doorframe.Sealed shut.“This would be why I’m here,” Nursery said, her voice soft.  She began humming, and it was a lullaby sort of hum.A music box sort of chiming joined the humming.“Fuck that shit,” Blindside said.  I was the closest person to them as they stood somewhere near me.   I lay near the butt end of the eighteen wheeler, which had its nose in the wall of the building.  Nursery and Snag were at the door.  I wasn’t sure if Blindside was talking to me.The humming seemed to be picked up elsewhere, and the music box noises intensified, with new notes and a higher tempo.  The area near the door blurred.  It was a window into another world, what had to be a pocket dimension, but for the most part it seemed unsure if it was our world or the pocket world.An indoor setting, at a glance.  Beds and walls that didn’t line up with things in our world.I felt Blindside’s hand on my neck.  They felt for my pulse.“Asshole is invincible, and so he doesn’t even think to get your gun from you.  You’re lying on it,” Blindside said.  “If I roll you onto your back, will it kill you?”It was a question I’d heard variants of before, in a tone I’d heard before.  A tone from someone that didn’t really care about me.We’re going to roll you over now and check for sores.  Is that alright?We’re going to wash you now.  Can you try to move this arm?Can I get you anything?  Would you like water, or something to eat?



Condescending, caring more about themselves, feigning concern or consideration.  They just wanted to get on with their day.  Even the ones that did care lost patience sometimes.  Stubborn, aggressive people like me made it easy to lose patience.I made myself be calm.  I exhaled slowly, and the exhalation came out as a shudder.  It wasn’t because I was hurt, but because the memories were close to the surface.Blindside eased me onto my back, then I felt them touch my gun.My eyes snapped open.  My arm lashed out, one swing, mindful that they were probably just a fragile human being.I didn’t make contact.  Muscles in my arm wrenched, seized, and cramped as the entire arm locked up, just in time to keep me from touching them.“Aha,” Blindside said.I felt them grip my gun hard.  My initial fumble to grab the gun ran into the same problem.  My hand hit an imaginary wall.The gun had a buckle keeping it in the hip holster.  They hadn’t undone the buckle, and they weren’t able to pull the gun free before I jumped up to my feet, backing a short distance away.  The hand pulled free.I still couldn’t see them.  My head was turned to one side, I had a glare on my face, and I walked slowly, keeping track of them by keeping them at the very edge of my field of view.I imagined I looked a little feral, pacing as I was, trying to track them with my other senses, being unable to make eye contact.I moved my hand experimentally.  I hit the wall.I couldn’t point at them, then.  I couldn’t hit them, based on my earlier issue.“What do they feed you shits?” Blindside asked.  “You get thrown from a bus mid-impact and you have it in you to pull this?  I’m impressed.”The dreamy blur was disappearing, the way in closing behind Nursery and Snag.  The background humming and chiming was fading.I hoped the others were retreating, finding a place in the building they could hunker down until help came.“Listen,” Blindside said.  “I don’t want trouble.  I don’t want to hurt a civilian.  I’m keeping to the rules.  Lie down, put your hands on your head, let me take the gun.  I’ll give it back when I’m done.”“You’re going to kidnap Fume Hood.  I can’t stand by and let that happen.”“You can’t do anything about it,” Blindside said.  “We’re going to borrow them, then we’ll be on our way.”“Borrow?  You’re giving her back after?  Unharmed?”“Yep.  Mostly unharmed.  The woman who lost her kid wants to have words with her.  Shout at her, make her feel bad.  She and some others paid a lot of money to make it happen.  Then we drop her back off somewhere near here and drive off.”“For that, you drive a truck into a building and traumatize a crowd?”“Intel said we were good to hit the building there, use that as our entry point.  Scaring her was part of the deal, so was fucking her over,” Blindside said.  “Stirring up the crowd, it doesn’t affect us much.  We live in one of the corners.  For her, it keeps her from finding any success.”“For the sake of the woman who lost her child?”“Yeah.”“And she’s personally going to shout at Fume Hood there?”“Fume Hood, Bad Apple, Horse Apple, Apple Cider, whatever you want to call her.  Yeah.”I nodded slowly.“Just lie down.  Let it be.  Give up the gun, stop fighting, we do our cape shit and you carry on with your day.  Police are under our control, nearest capes are half an hour away.  This is the way it is sometimes.”“The files I got when I accepted this job said the woman in question died,” I said.  “The pregnant lady who lost her child.”“Really?”I nodded, my eyes still fixed on the ground, as close to Blindside as I could get.  If they moved into my field of vision, a forced movement of my eye and head would let me know.“At Gold Morning.  Her home address was one of the cities hit hard.  No sign of her after the fact.  Authorities investigated when the word about this attack first came up.  Which leads me to think you’re lying through your teeth.”“People visit family, go out of town for work, have stays in the hospital…  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve talked to people who narrowly dodged being in the wrong place at that one critical time.”“Stop,” I said.  “I caught you in one lie, let’s leave it at that.”Blindside fell silent.I heard a scuff.  My head turned-was allowed to turn- as Blindside moved around to my side.  I backed away a few paces.I heard Blindside stop moving.“Change your stance,” Blindside said.“My stance?”“Your head is turned as far to the right as it can go.  If I move to your right, the reflex is going to be to move your head further right.  You could snap your neck.  You’d probably close your eyes first, but I’d rather not risk it.”I obliged, shifting where my shoulders were, so my left shoulder pointed at them.  I was aware that it made it easier to circle behind me.“And raise your chin a bit.”“Why?” I asked.I heard the sound of Blindside moving too late.  I reached out to block or catch the incoming attack, and hit the wall where I couldn’t move my arm too far toward them.Something swung at an angle that avoided my arm.  I brought my forcefield up just in time for the thing to hit me on the chin.  An uppercut with a blunt instrument that should have broken my jaw.Before Blindside could recover or figure out what had happened, I went on the offense.  I couldn’t hit them with my hand, I couldn’t point at them, but if I swung my hand at them, elbow jutting out-I felt muscles seize, locking up.  Blindside caught my arm, pushing me in the direction I’d already been going, and shoved me to the ground.  Martial art.The blunt instrument-I saw the tip of a metal bat- struck down toward my shin.It rebounded off of the forcefield as the field came back.  The metal sang.“Ah fucking hah,” Blindside said.  “Fuck me.  You’re a cape.”I lurched to my feet, putting some distance between myself and them.Elbows didn’t work either.The muscles in my arm and shoulder twitched with the lingering strain or sprain that had gone with the interruption.I backed away until my forcefield came back up.  I drew in a deep breath.“You’re full of surprises,” Blindside said.I undid a buckle and pulled my armored vest over my head in one smooth motion.“That’s not very surprising though,” they said.  “I can see where you’re going with this.  I’ve been at this a few years.  Some of the workarounds and tricks are getting old by now.”I shifted my grip so I held the vest by the shoulder.“The bus is back.  Are they capes in disguise too?”The bus was back?  I couldn’t see without looking past Blindside, and I didn’t want to lose my bearings.They were watching then?Well, I imagined Blindside made it hard to watch.I swung, using the vest as a bludgeon.  My arm stopped, but the vest continued.I felt hands against my back, gripping the back of my top.  Another move, Judo or Aikido, stepping into arm’s reach, too close for the vest to hit me, trusting their power to keep my arm from hitting them, and throwing me to the ground.I used my forcefield, and I used its strength to arrest the movement, stopping myself.  A bit of my flight.With Blindside directly behind me, I drew my gun, and I turned to the right this time, swinging out with gun in hand.“Nope,” Blindside said.  “That won’t-”I dropped the vest, my hand going to my ear, and I fired the instant my arm stopped moving.  I shot the stone wall of the community center eight times.The volume of it was such that I only barely heard Blindside’s exclamation of pain.  My ears rang- but the gun had to have been right next to the villain mercenary’s ear.This was how I operated.  Even if I was trying not to be too blatant with others watching.  I was trying to consider more before I acted and took this route, moderating myself.Shock.  Shake them on a sensory level.I stooped low to pick up the vest, then swung it as I had before.   Blindside stumbled forward, much as they had before, into my reach, both forearms pressing against my back.I’d had to moderate my aura, back at the hospital.  My mood darkened even thinking about that time, much as it had darkened when I saw myself in the mirror and remembered what I had been.It took all I had to not let that darkness affect how I handled the aura.  I’d told myself, so many times, I wanted to be better.  Regrets weren’t worth anything if I didn’t let them drive me to do it better in the future.For two months my aura had been one of the only real communication tools that I had, that didn’t require rounds of blinking and interpretation, or fumbling at a special keyboard with hands that didn’t map to how my brain thought my body should move.  I’d had some practice with the nuance of it.Blindside was pressing against my back, and my aura was stronger the closer people were to me.  I controlled the aura’s expression to keep it small and more concentrated.Awe.  Catch them on an emotional level.Blindside stumbled back.I spun around in the other direction, and bludgeoned them with the weight of my vest, using it like a flail.  They bounced off of the logging truck and collapsed.Destroy was my usual third step.  I hoped I’d held back enough.  I’d wanted to disable only, but it was hard to know my own strength.“You conscious?” I asked the villain.  My own voice sounded far away, distorted, hard to hear over the ringing.I should have heard any response.  I didn’t.  Silence.Blindside’s power didn’t let me check their condition, visually or otherwise.I bent over them, fumbling, tracing their outline with the back of my hand, and finding walls even there, somehow.  I found their head, medium length hair, and tried to press the back of my hand against their ear.  My arm muscles seized.I tried to use my knuckles to get into the ear, since I couldn’t use my fingertips without pointing or driving them toward Blindside, and I still hit the wall.Blindside had been using something to communicate with others.  If it was a walkie-talkie, phone, or earpiece, it wasn’t anywhere I could access it.  Blindside’s power protected them.The movement in the corner of my eye caught me off guard.  The bus.  The front corner was badly damaged, but it was chugging along somehow.  I hadn’t heard it approaching.  Where the paint had been black, it had broken away, revealing some of the bright yellow paint that it had once had, when it had been a school bus.Jasper was waving his arm out the window, pointing.  I could hear his shouts, but the words were muted.Incoming.The villains would have heard the shots.I looked up, and I saw Lord of Loss at the roof’s edge.  He’d turned himself into something resembling a tree.  A static emplacement, less able to move, but with roots that would extend into the building and secure his position so he could leverage his full strength.He was growing by the second, smoke billowing out and solidifying into branching points.  He might just have the reach to hit us down on the street level, big as he was.There were two entry points that weren’t windows.  Two courses of action stood out to me.  The first was to simply fly to a window, abandon Jasper.  I’d lose my job, but I would have to trust they would leave and be safe while I did what I could to help Fume Hood.But I had something I wanted to ask.I motioned for them to come, to hurry.There were two doors into the building that I knew about.  The front door was no doubt seized by the mind-controlled army.  The side door had been painted.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to tear my way in and find out that the paint was a problem.I didn’t want to charge in, only to find that they were securing their retreat.  They’d be looking for trouble coming from either of the entrances after hearing the shots.There might have been a third way in.I ran toward the nose of the eighteen wheeled logging truck, and I climbed over the nose of it.  It had collided with the wall, and it had done some damage.Reaching up, I pulled at the damaged part overhead, and I leveraged the strength my forcefield provided to tear it away.  I pushed at another part, widening the gap.The bus parked so its nose was tucked into the corner between the nose of the logging truck and the wall.  Jasper, Mar, and Landon climbed out of the bus.“Are you okay?” Jasper asked.I liked that it was the first thing he’d asked.  Gilpatrick’s five pound of gun speech taken to heart.  Less than five pounds of weaponry, more than fifteen pounds of protection, twenty five pounds of support and problem solving.  Jasper’s first thoughts were on the latter.  Those were supposed to be the priorities, the ratios.“A bit of road rash,” I said, examining my arms.  “Too much adrenaline to feel the pain.”Shadows shifted.  Lord of Loss had decided to detach from the roof, and was pulling himself together enough to start climbing down.“Come on,” I said.We ducked in through the gap, into a staff washroom.  I couldn’t see the source of the water, but it pooled on the floor below.  We passed through the door and into the hallway.“So you’re a cape,” Mar said.  He’d been the kid who’d sat behind me on the bus and made smug insinuations about my name and background.I gave him a dark look.  It looked like Landon was on his side.“You’ve got blood on your upper lip,” Mar said.  “It looks like you’ve got a mustache.”“Fuck off, Mar,” Jasper said.I rubbed at my upper lip with the side of my hand, looking back to make sure Lord of Loss hadn’t followed us.I could hear the humming and the music box.  Upstairs somewhere.  I could hear people in the building.“Jasper,” I said.“What?”“I have to ask.  How much of this is setup?”“Setup?” Mar asked, incredulous.“I know I sound paranoid,” I said.  “I know if there’s a scenario or something, it’s probably against the rules to ask or answer, but I need the honest truth here, no bullshit.”“You sound really fucking paranoid,” Mar said.  “Holy fuck, you capes are screwed up in the head.”“Shut up, Mar,” Jasper said.“Just answer, please,” I said, my eyes fixed on the end of the hallway, watching for the mind-controlled soldiers.  “Gilpatrick set me up with a bunch of new soldiers I don’t know that he can somehow vouch for, he insisted on them, and he sent me into a situation that was liable to get messy.  It doesn’t make sense unless I somehow imagine I’m being set up to fail.”“Fuck me,” Mar said.“It’s not really setup,” Jasper said.  “Gilpatrick explained before I left.”I nodded to myself.“They wanted to make sure you could be trusted.  They thought they’d stick you with some objective observers for three, four routine jobs, make sure you stuck to the rules, grade you, leave it at that.”Objective.  I looked at Mar.Yeah.  Right.“And if I didn’t accept the job?  If I’d told Gilpatrick I didn’t want to do this patrol?”“He really thought you would,” Jasper said.  “He told me that.  He was a bit stuck, caught between superiors saying he had to make you or he couldn’t keep you on, and thinking you wouldn’t.  Then you said yes.”I frowned.  One impulse.  One spur-of-the-moment decision.Cause and effect.  Every time I acted on impulse, bad things happened.  Some of the worst things had happened.  People around me got hurt.  I got hurt.  Two years in the hospital.It was so much of why I’d wanted to slow down.“I’m pretty fucking glad you said yes,” Jasper said.  “If it had been me in charge here I’m pretty sure most of us would be dead already.”I exhaled.  Deep breaths.  I couldn’t fall into the mindset of dwelling on the past.“You’re a good guy, Jasper.”“I try,” he said.I paused, thinking for a moment, listening to the noises elsewhere in the building.I glanced at Landon and Mar.“I’m a good guy too,” Mar said.“Stay put,” I said, firm.“You’re going alone?” Jasper asked.“Yeah.  Just find a corner of the building to hole up in.  Hide, be safe.”There was a balance to be struck.  I wanted to think I’d reasoned this through, as much as I could with the time constraint, the enemy no doubt closing in on the capes.  It was too risky to bring these guys with.Going alone.“Stay,” I said.  “Be safe.”I sprinted off, raising my forcefield for good measure.I entered the kitchen by another door.  Where I’d talked with Fume Hood.Something exploded overhead.I looked up.Vapor, shards of crystal.A moment later, there were two more small explosions, one after another, in a line.Crystal clear, Crystalclear.Not alone, then.  I hurried in the direction indicated.                                                                                             Daybreak – 1.5                                                                                             I paused at one of the doors of the kitchen.  I’d come in one door and there were two more.  One led to a hallway with people standing stationary at the end.  Another led to the main room, where everyone had been seated before this had begun.Crystalclear hadn’t signaled me further, and I took that to mean I was supposed to pause or wait.  People in the main room were moving around.  I peered through a crack in the door to see if there was an opening, a break in the ranks I could use to slip through or get something done.I saw the people Kingdom Come had controlled had settled in, most finding seats in the folding chairs that had been set up throughout the room.  Some stood around the side or sat with their backs to the wall.  Others stood at the windows, watching outside.The majority of the crowd was at rest.  The ones who weren’t had guns drawn.  The police officers were among them.The officer with the sad mustache was at the front of the room, face streaked with blood.  He was talking, and I couldn’t see who he was talking to.I listened to the conversation, two people talking against a faint background of a chorus of hums and music box sounds.“You want me to negotiate with terrorists,” a woman said.“We want you to do what is best for your community,” the police officer said, in a very different voice than he’d used earlier.“By playing along?”“This started with civilians, it involves cape on cape violence,” the officer said.  “If you cooperate, we’ll pay for damage done, we’ll extend our protection over your community in a way that keeps capes out of sight and mostly out of mind.”“A protection racket?”“Not a racket.  No money or expectations.  We’ll take the woman and we’ll tell you what to do in order to smooth things over.”“I don’t understand why.  What does this serve?  Fume Hood was upfront about her history.  She wanted to serve her time in this way.”“If we tell you why, will you cooperate?”“I can’t promise that,” the woman said.  I was assuming she was the District Rep.  Why had she left the others?“The City is like a pressure cooker.  The pressure is mounting and has been for a while.  Things inside are heating up and winter is fast approaching.  A number of great thinkers seem to think we need to vent the-”“Vent the pressure?” the District Rep asked.“Yes,” the police officer said.  “The-”There was an explosion overhead.  Another of Crystalclear’s shots.  Two more, leading from one corner of the room and away.I looked at the crowd, and I saw the person closest to me staring at me.Kingdom Come knew, he’d seen.“We’ll continue this conversation shortly.  You’ve got a cape with a gun inside the building.”I backed away.  Crystalclear created more explosions close to the other door.  The people who had been standing guard at the end of the hallway, probably.I retreated, ducking behind a counter.They entered the room simultaneously, doors banging against the wall.I ducked down, staying behind cover.“You’re the one who fought Blindside?” the one at the door asked.  The police officer.I remained silent.“I don’t want to shed any blood that isn’t mine,” he said.  He was moving deeper into the room.  I heard the door squeak, peeked, and saw the corner of it.  It had been opened and was being held open.  Another person?“Alright,” he said.One of the issues of being a parahuman was that there wasn’t a history to build on or a peerage to draw from.  We had powers, yes.  Some of those powers were similar to the powers others had, but there were almost always tricks and caveats, strengths one person had that another didn’t.  I couldn’t copy Alexandria’s old tactics and style because my invincibility worked differently.  Timing was so much more important to me.I could be shot, if my timing was wrong, or if their timing was especially right.A person like Jasper could take classes in martial arts and get lessons on the range, and he could use tools and draw on the experience of millions of others who had bodies that worked like his did, a set of capabilities that were virtually identical to his own.There was only one Victoria Dallon with Victoria Dallon’s powers.  I had to lean heavily on my own experience.  In exercising my abilities, there was a point beyond which I was the only person that could teach myself – nobody resembled me closely enough to be an instructor in how to fight, how to process, or how to or pass on their experience.But my own experience was a drawback if I was caught in the moment, where I had to rely on instinct but that instinct pointed me right back to my old ways.These people were innocent.  The officer, the others at the door.  Maybe some had been protesters.  Kingdom Come had no issue in using them, but I couldn’t hurt his pawns.He could have moved them as a group, but he didn’t.  He moved like a chessmaster played chess.  One person taking a new position, pausing, checking the area, then another person moving.  The police officer in charge -chief or sheriff, I wasn’t sure-  had stopped in the center of the room.  Others were moving around the perimeter.I caught a glimpse of one by the gun he was holding, and moved around the corner.  They all moved the same way when they moved, pistols held up, gripped in two hands that were dotted in drops of drying blood, pointed at the ceiling.  I saw the gun before I saw the rest of him.The lullaby continued, faint and distant.  It wasn’t enough to obscure any scuffle I made.  I didn’t want to make noise, and whatever the movies showed, it was hard to crawl around while wearing boots and be sure to not make any sound.I didn’t like flying.  I wasn’t confident in it like I had been.  Two years had passed in the hospital, and my sense of flight had been as disturbed as the movement of my arm or my attempts at vocalization.  It was supposed to be back, but it was a muscle I hadn’t exercised.I wanted to fly, but it was tainted.I raised myself off the ground, still hunched over, staying low enough that the counters would block me from sight, and used flight as much as light pushes on the sides of the cabinet to propel myself away from the advancing gunman.I had other training to draw on that wasn’t self-taught.  There was what I’d learned and absorbed from time with family, but that whole experience was so full of pitfalls I barely wanted to touch on it.The Wards.  I hadn’t been with them for long.  I’d absorbed some things from Dean, because I lived the cape stuff and Dean was willing to teach it.  I’d studied up and I’d taken the tests.  I knew the numbers and the labels.  I knew the approach formations for squads.  Simple, making conflict with parahumans as textbook as possible, black ink on white paper, sans serif.In fighting that perpetual battle of trying to think things through and still act in time, the classifications were a nice shortcut.  Apply the label, assume what worked against most people of one classification, and if it clearly didn’t, it was still a starting point.He was edging closer.Kingdom Come was a breaker and a master.  He had a toggled state that changed the rules as they pertained to him.  Shake, blow up, and he was now a horde of people controlled by the bodily fluids on them.  Masters were second highest priority as targets, breakers were targets that required timing, often hitting them when they were in the state that they were weakest.Kingdom Come made that complicated by not giving me a body to target.They were closing in.  They’d crossed the length of the room and if I had to guess, four of them were standing within fifteen feet of me, guns held high, where it would be that much harder for me to lunge for the weapon.  He didn’t have perfect coordination of their movements, I had to assume, unless they were all doing the same thing, like when the crowd had turned their heads.The old me would have dealt with this by blitzing them.  Hit each hard, fast, before they had a chance to react.  Some minor harm would have come to innocents, but the situation would be resolved.The current me waited, staying silent, letting them get close.  One to my left, one in the middle avenue of the kitchen, between the two rows of counter-islands, and one on the far right, furthest from me.As I set my boot down on the floor, ready to move, Crystalclear volunteered his help.  An explosion at the ceiling, a few feet behind the guy to my left.He spun around, looking, and I took advantage, leaping over the counter, reaching for the gun he held aloft.  I seized it and his hands, and pulled both to the ground, where the counters kept us out of sight of the other two.They started to approach at a run, each around one end of the counter, so they’d catch me on both sides, and Crystalclear offered another blast between me and them.  It took out the light fixture above, and cast the corner of the room into shadow, illuminated by periodic sparks.It gave me a moment’s pause to think.  I ignored the man I’d brought to the ground, as I held his hands and the gun.  I didn’t even need my strength- only leverage and my body weight.I couldn’t do anything to him that would put him down for good without risking hurting the real person.  I couldn’t do anything to Kingdom Come, as much as the rule for dealing with masters said I should.  He didn’t have a material body.I used a burst of strength and tore the gun from the one man’s hands, sliding it along the floor so it went under one of the appliances.  I’d gone high to go after the first one, so I went low as I went after the officer to my left, throwing myself around the counter, using a bit of flight to help keep up my speed as I went around the corner.I tackled him to the ground, holding him as we went down to keep the impact from being too hard.  I’d managed to get one hand around his wrist, and as he pulled his other hand away, gripping the gun, I seized that wrist too.That left one in the middle of the room, one unarmed and on the ground and no doubt climbing to his feet, and one coming around the corner, gun ready.I flew, sliding the police officer along the floor.  I twisted to hit the cabinet with my shoulder as we reached the end of the row.  That would bruise tomorrow.  I flew again, to move another direction, keeping away from the rest.As we stopped, the officer had enough in the way of bearings to drop the gun.  He drew his knee toward his chest, and then kicked the gun so it would slide on the kitchen floor.Someone stepped through the doorway, stooping low and catching the gun in a way that wouldn’t have been possible if they hadn’t had a greater awareness.No, as much as he was a master in execution, he was also a breaker.  I had to be sensible.  It didn’t make sense to fight a breaker like this when he was in his breaker state.I pushed the police chief away, and then, reorienting, I flew straight up, through the ceiling.  I felt my forcefield go down, bracing myself in case I brushed up against any wiring.Second floor.  I checked my surroundings.  None of Kingdom Come’s people.  The lullaby music was louder.  The drones would arrive soon.  I moved, hurrying down the hall.I found the stairwell.  I stepped into it, glancing down.  No sign of an approach.I peeled some of the metal away from the railing, stepped back into the hallway, and leveraged my strength to twist the metal around the door handle, to seal it shut.  I knew there could be other stairwells, but at least this way I’d hear them if they tried coming this way.Covering my back.Priorities.  Blindside was as classic a stranger as I’d ever dealt with.  Out of action or out of consideration for now.Lord of Loss was a brute.  Textbook answer when faced with a brute was to ignore them as much as they allowed you to.  It would take too much effort and it would take too much time when dealing with someone who couldn’t be decisively dealt with.I could remember studying the PRT paperwork with Dean, doing the quizzes.  He’d said the rule for brutes had an unofficial second part.  That as much as you might try to put them off, they had a way of making you deal with them.What had I said in response to that?  I was a brute on paper.Had that been the study session we’d had in my room?  Dean would have been leaning against a pile of pillows at the head of my bed, Lyo-Leo on his lap, while Dean pretended to have him read the answers.  I’d been sitting at the foot of the bed, papers and books strewn between us.  Real homework and superhero stuff.The door had been left open, at my dad’s insistence.  One foot tucked under me, I’d snuck my one foot across the bed until I could touch Dean’s knee, trace my toe along his leg.  Seeing if I could break his focus enough to make him mess up while reading aloud.No, wait, that had been a few days after Dean had reminded me of the brute rule.  I’d been studying it with more interest because Dean was turning eighteen before long, and we were worried he’d get moved to another city, even with his family situation being what it was.  I’d seriously been considering joining the Wards and then the Protectorate, so I could follow him.But I’d told my stuffed lion that he needed to remind Dean that brutes like me had a way of making you deal with them.  They could only be ignored for so long.Normally clever Dean had been at a loss for words.  He’d grabbed my toe and squeezed it.  I’d wiggled it in his hand.  We’d been familiar enough with each other that the silence that followed didn’t feel bad.  Awkward in a good way, even.He’d, after a long pause, found the clever thing to say, but he’d stumbled his way through it.  It would be my pleasure.  Pause.  To deal with you.It hadn’t been long after that that we’d had our first night together.  It had taken two days of desperate attempts at coordinating schedules and patrols, for me to get out without family wanting to join me, for Dean to avoid the ‘sidekick’ situation and go out in costume without a Protectorate member joining him.My heart hurt, thinking of Dean.  My knight in shining armor.Still, I smiled as I remembered some of the emails we’d exchanged, my hands resting on the metal I’d used to lock the door.  Dean, ever the gentleman, had wanted to negotiate and check everything, from my comfort levels about X, Y, and Z to how my personal forcefield would factor into our time together.I’d laughed at that, which had been the tip-off for Amy to realize something was up.  She’d-And I’d gone and done it.  Let my guard down, tripped over the stumbling block, stepped on the emotional landmine.  There was only the hurt, now, none of the mixed, warm feeling that came from thinking about Dean.I pushed it all out of mind.  It wasn’t the time for that anyway.  I was prone to getting lost in thought, even though it sometimes felt like every path led to the same, regrettable destination.Dry, deliberate classifications.  Moving forward.  Deep breaths, when my chest hurt enough that breathing was hard.  Back to numbers and labels.  Lord of Loss and Kingdom Come had to be ignored, but I could trust that Lord of Loss would come into the picture somewhere along the line.  We still had to get out of here or deal with him.Nursery was close enough for me to hear the hums and chimes.  Shaker, clearly.  Not dissimilar to Labyrinth from back in Brockton Bay.  The rule for dealing with shakers was to avoid fighting them on their own turf.Snag was changer or tinker, possibly striker.  Those arms.  He had something mover going on with how he’d gone after the bus Jasper was driving.Still, there might be another in play.I ventured down the hallway, still feeling that ache in my chest, feeling acutely aware of my own body, the way clothes constrained me, reaffirmed me, yet every reaffirmation was a reminder that I needed that small reminder in the first place, and why.My hand brushed against the wall as I walked.  The closer to the north end of the building I got, the more of the lullaby I could hear.  Multiple sources formed the humming, soft around the edges, each slightly out of sync with the others in a way that suggested they all came from different places.I felt the texture of the wall change.  Smoother.  I felt and saw the difference in texture and color, respectively.  Gray and dusty rose shades, as if seen through a filter.  The wall had become a painted surface that felt as if it had been painted over many times, some droplets having run down the wall and set in place, ridges elsewhere where similar bumps had been painted over and become a faint rise.I could hear her now.  Nursery.  A human’s hum, joined by all the others.  She was close.Peering around the corner of the T-shaped junction, I didn’t see her, but I saw the change.  Her turf, as it was.  Dusty rose carpet, picture frames with simple things like animals and boats in grays, blacks, and pale pinks.  A crib, white, covered with a quilt.I stayed at the edges of it, going further down the hall rather than turning the corner and venturing into her realm.  Only the wall to my right was affected.  A baby carriage draped in a blanket was parked beside a small bookshelf that had been stacked with children’s books and building blocks.  The cloth stuck as if it had been taped down or the sheer amount of time it had been there had nearly fused it to the fabric of the carriage, producing a tearing sound reminiscent of Velcro.  The carriage was empty, except for a vague oblong stain on the seat’s back and the seat itself.When I left it behind, though, I could tell that there was humming coming from that vicinity, one of the soft, vague hums in the grander chorus.Fuck me.Every five or ten feet, there were more.  A car seat removed from the car, handle up, blanket over it.  Another crib, a much-used blanket tangled in the mobile, a child’s wagon.  Toys, clocks, wall decorations, cardboard boxes stuffed of baby clothes, marked for ages zero to three.  A rocking horse and more.I was forced to venture further into it to get closer to the true sound’s source.I saw her.  Nursery was a woman with an ankle-length dress, a shawl over her shoulders.  She clutched the shawl and rocked from side to side, speaking the inarticulate sounds rather than humming.Beside her was Snag.  He was heavyset.  Two hundred and fifty pounds, at least, possibly three hundred pounds, and he wasn’t quite six feet tall.  That mass was made even bulkier by his coat, which was fastened closed, draping down to his ankles, where his boots were.  The sleeves had been modified to be longer, fitting the arms, which reached to the floor.It was my first chance at seeing his face, though.  He had long black hair and a thick beard, both in the loose heavy-metal take.  His mask looked like he’d taken handfuls of black clay and layered it over the skin his hair and beard didn’t cover.  The mask created a kind of neanderthal brow with a permanent glare built into it; the circles under his eyes were so dark it was hard to tell exactly where the eyeholes of the black clay mask started.  It might have been thick rubber, melted to be in the crude shape needed, the texture left unrefined.Nursery barely flinched as the door opened.  Fume Hood stuck her head and arm out, and she fired three projectiles.  One hit the slash of white paint that separated Nursery’s realm from the door, exploding into a cloud of gas.  Two hit near where Nursery and Snag were, going to pieces instead of exploding or producing gas.The gas from the first shot expanded to fill the space between Nursery’s pocket world and the door at the end of the hall.“Speed it up,” Snag said.Nursery turned his way.  She wore a cloth mask with holes cut out for the eyes.  The cloth had a floral print and was bound close to her neck with a series of chokers.  She continued to mumble and hum, but she’d stopped rocking in place.“Come on now,” Snag growled.  “We’re expecting trouble.”The humming stopped.  The music box chimes that seemed to be plucking and pealing from the light fixtures and behind the walls grew noticeably quieter.“Every time I have to stop to respond to you, Snag, it slows us down.  Be a good boy and be patient, trust us.  We’re making progress, even if you can’t see it.”“If we get caught between the new player and Bad Apple’s team-”Nursery let go of her shawl to reach out, placing her hand flat on Snag’s face, covering eyes, nose and mouth.  He pulled back, and I ducked back behind the corner, so he wouldn’t catch a glimpse of me.“Hush,” she said.  “We’re safe even if that happens.  This is my sanctuary.”“I will bite you if you touch my face again.”“You’re not as scary as you pretend to be, Snag.  I know scary.  You’re just a man that’s dressing up,” Nursery said.  She sounded gentle, calm even after being threatened.“Try me.”“Please, hush,” she said.  “Let me do my work.”“If you take any longer, I’m going to push for plan B.”Nursery resumed humming.No more feedback from Crystalclear.  The group at the end of the hall weren’t doing much of anything.More to the point, I was rather concerned that the area of the building I was in didn’t entirely map to the layout of the building that I’d seen from the outside.  There was just a little too much room to either side of Nursery and Snag.“Tell me the details,” Snag said, his voice growl-like even when he wasn’t threatening Nursery.  He’d walked a distance away from her and toward me.A pause, long.  Snag picked up a child’s plush and threw it down the hall, bowling over a stack of thin hardcover books.“Well, it’s taking plenty of time.  So is Nursery,” he said.  “What’s Kingdom’s status?”Another pause.“At this stage I’d settle for plan B,” he said.  “I’d pay for the property damage.”Pause.“They’re trying to buy time and it’s working.  Tell Blindside to hurry up.”Blindside.I stood with my back to the wall, listening in.  Crystalclear hadn’t communicated, but I wasn’t sure he could.  Fume Hood and Tempera weren’t doing much but holding the fort and delaying.Nursery continued humming, but she piqued the last hum with an inquisitive note.“Blindside faked being out.  Should arrive soon.  We’ve got some details on our mystery guest.  Dressed like one of the troopers I stashed in the room back there.  Untouchable but still wary of being hit.  Emotion control.”The humming stopped.I expected Snag to complain.  He didn’t.I chanced a look around the corner.Nursery had turned around.  She faced me.  Snag was gone.I stepped out of cover, one hand on my gun, glancing around to see where Snag had disappeared to.I wasn’t supposed to fight a shaker in her domain.  But here she was, standing with her hands clasped in front of her, defenseless.  She was also the only thing standing between me and the room where Fume Hood was.“Let me through,” I said.“No,” she said.I pushed out my aura, as hard as I could manage.She didn’t flinch.  It didn’t reach her.That was what this was.  Her sanctuary was a protection from shaker effects.  She overrode everything by transplanting this screwed up baby decor into the area.I wondered if I could hit her.  I looked around for Snag and didn’t see him.“Wake up,” she said.“What?” I asked.“Wake up, sweetie.”The crib, a little red wagon with blankets heaped over it, and a carriage nearby jumped, rattling as if something had moved within.I heard wet sounds.  Throughout the hazy altered space, the meaty squelching started to overtake the background hums.I stopped in my tracks.Things moved beneath the blankets.  She still hadn’t budged.I turned around and ran.Fuck this.I got away as fast as my legs would take me.  I hit the wall at the end of the hallway and stopped myself with my hands rather than slow down with my legs.  I turned right and headed away, past more cribs, more strollers, baby seats and bouncy chairs, all draped in their blankets of varying types and quality.  Some tipped over from the violence of the agitation.Yeah, no, whatever it was she was doing, I wasn’t going to mess with it.There had to be other ways.I escaped the area of Nursery’s shaker effect, stepping back into ordinary community center hallway.  I was in the opposite corner of the second floor from where I’d started.Looking out the window, I could see the shadows cast by Lord of Loss’ branches.  Was it worth chancing flying outside, then flying into the room where Fume Hood was, when Lord of Loss could try hitting me or grabbing me?There was another stairwell at the end of the hall- one I hadn’t sealed.The door opposite it had something hanging on it.  A gauntlet with clawed fingertips, the ‘arm’ something electronic.  The claw’s tips were embedded in the wood of doorframe and door both.“Hello?” I called out.  I glanced back to make sure Nursery and Snag hadn’t followed me.“Don’t touch the door!” was the rushed response.“Who is it?” I asked.“Patrol from the high school, community center staff,” the voice from the other side said.  “Don’t touch the door.  There’s a bomb!”“I see it,” I said.“They said they’d disable it when they left.  You said to stay safe, so we cooperated and let them lock us in.”“That’s- that’s good,” I said.  My heart was still pounding from Nursery’s thing.  I was pretty sure Blindside wasn’t around, because my senses weren’t being affected.  “We’ll get this figured out.”I wasn’t sure how.  They had a shaker power to override Tempera and Fume Hood.  Potentially Crystalclear and Longscratch as well, depending.  They had Lord of Loss sequestering the outside and they had Nursery taking over the inside.In the same moment I turned my thoughts to Snag and his disappearance, two mechanical arms stabbed out of the nearest wall as if the wall was paper.  One hand caught me around the neck.  The other across the face.  I was slammed into the window, hard enough to shatter it and take out my forcefield.  Glass tinkled onto my head, into my hair, and all around me.Before I could get my bearings, he hauled me into the wall.  My head cracked into the drywall and I felt it break with the impact.  His hand gripped my mouth and the length of his long forearm caught me around the throat.I put my hands on his arms, and I felt the whir as machinery kicked into life.As someone with the ability to control emotions, I was supposed to be harder to read and affect.  It was why I’d deflected Crystalclear earlier.It was why Dean and I had gotten along.  Even why we’d been possible.Maybe that resistance came into play.  Maybe it turned Snag’s power from an emotional uppercut to a mere slap.  Negative emotions poured into me like liquid from a syringe.But a slap on an open wound could be enough to bring someone to their knees.  The walls came tumbling down, the memories flooding in, and my last coherent, present thought was that I hoped I wouldn’t maim or kill anyone in the meantime.                                                                                             Daybreak – 1.6                                                                                             Snag’s power hurt, and it hurt in a way that had nothing to do with shedding blood or breaking bones.  Emotion.  My body still reacted, my heart rate picking up, breathing choked, adrenaline churning, hormones shifting.  My thoughts were scattered, thrusting me into a state where I could either only reel or I could grope for a position in familiar ground.I didn’t want familiar.Reeling meant trying not to think, letting it wash over me and through me, and not letting my thoughts go where the feelings pointed.  It meant I still had a metal gauntlet on my face and a metal arm pulled against my throat, and I was handling the situation with instinct.  Fight or flight.Fight-No.  I only barely stopped myself.  I’d kill him if I fought.Fly then.I pushed out with my aura, hard.  The flip side of my observation moments ago was true.  I was supposed to be resistant to hits to my emotions because I could deliver those hits myself.  Snag would be resistant to my aura for similar reasons.He still let go, arms slipping back through the wall.  I had a moment where I thought about grabbing one of his wrists as it passed me, and I hesitated a moment too long.I backed away, staggering until I bumped into the window next to the broken one.  My chest hurt as if I’d had my heart ripped out, and thoughts of Dean flickered through my head.  It was a continuation of my thoughts from earlier, one sample in a long, long series of thoughts I hadn’t let myself finish over the past few months and years that the surge of emotion was now filling in and pushing to the surface.It was loss, if I had to put a name to it.  Nothing to do with the man on the roof.It was me in the hospital, with Auntie Sarah and Crystal, not knowing what to say because Uncle Neil and Eric had just died.  Crystal had been hurt too, and the place had been so busy and crowded that we’d gathered in the small curtained enclosure where her hospital bed was.  My mom had been gone, trying to get news on my dad’s situation, and my sister-It was going from that, the horrible feeling of helplessness and hopelessness, to hearing the curtain move.   I’d known it wasn’t my mom – she’d left only a minute ago.  It was as if someone had taken a want, desire, even a need equal to what I’d experienced in my childhood and early teens, when I’d wanted to be a hero, when I’d written letters to Santa and wished it during every birthday candle extinguishing and for every shooting star I’d seen from when I was four to when I was fourteen, if someone had gathered all of that feeling and compressed it into a single, concentrated moment of wanting it to be Dean coming into the enclosure to give me a hug.  And then not getting what I wanted.The PRT staff member had come in to let me know Gallant had wanted to see me while there was still time.  Dean had.Heart ripped out of my chest, just like that, just like this feeling here.  Losses, losses, fucking losses.  That ambiguous fucking word they’d used when they’d delivered the mass report.  Not deaths, not the ‘downs’ that were injured just enough they were out of the fight, just losses because they’d needed to be brief with the list of names so long.  Dean’s name had been on that list.Where?  It had taken me three tries to get the word out.  They’d told me where, but I hadn’t traveled  a straight line to get there.  I’d zig-zagged, from doctor to nurse to PRT staff.  I’d asked people who had no cause or reason to know, tried describing her.  Asking, asking.  Pleading.Where was she?  Had they seen her?  Where was the last place anyone saw her?  I need-Where?  I shook my head, trying to rattle my brain and get centered in the present.  Where was Snag?  He’d disappeared into the next room.  I stepped forward, feeling unwieldy, and thrust my hand at the door, taking it off of the hinges, damaging the door’s frame.  Empty room.  Nowhere to be found.My hand shook from the emotion, extended out in front of me.  I clenched it into a fist.She’d been nowhere to be found too.I’d arrived alone, no help to offer.  Too late to say anything or hear anything from him.  I’d choked on my words when it came to saying something to his parents.  There’d been this feeling like I couldn’t react the way I’d wanted and needed to, because his parents were there and they were somehow maintaining their composure.  Upset, yes, but they were wealthy and dignified enough they would do their crying in private.  They had weathered their losses years before and it had been the same then, according to Dean.  Now it was on Dean’s behalf.What options did that leave me?  Break down into hysterical sobbing and act like I was hurting more than his own family was?  It might have been dismissed as the drama of a teenager and I hadn’t wanted that to be the final note on Dean and me, in their eyes, in the eyes of bystanders.Like I imagined anyone in a relationship did, I’d wondered if we were in love, and then I’d known we were in love, and I’d grown close enough to him to wonder if he was a soulmate, dismissed the term just as easily as it had come up because it was silly and it didn’t matter either way, did it?  I’d received my answer on the question as I’d felt a part of me die during those long minutes of me trying and failing to say something to his family.From that to home.  Southwest end of the city, our house mostly untouched by the attack.  To dad being ‘impaired’, mom’s word, and mom being business as usual, emphasis on business, because that was how she dealt.To… a family member acting like they’d been replaced by a fucking pod person from another planet, gradually realizing that replacement had been a long time ago, and it was only now in context and crisis that I’d seen the alien-ness clearly, in the then-present and in retrospect.Painful, in its own way, to have nobody to turn to.  The hurt had been there like a block of ice, melting too slowly when I hadn’t had any warmth to reach out for, not any less cold as the water pooled.  Not any less for the time that passed.  Just… more ambient.This was like that.  Snag’s emotional effect was temporary.  The pain ebbed out, made my fingers feel numb and tingly, made it hard to breathe, and made me feel more physically weak and less coordinated than I should have been.I stumbled a few steps, and reached out to touch the wall for support as I resumed moving, entering the room Snag had been in when he’d punched his arms through the wall.  It was reminiscent of a hotel room, but rustic enough it could have been a bed and breakfast.  Two small beds, a bedside table, a desk, and a flatscreen television sitting on a dresser.He had a mover classification, I was pretty sure.  He’d used a trick to jump after the bus.  I made sure to look up, to avoid any ambush in case he jumped at me from the space between the top of the door and the ceiling.The room was empty.“Snag?” I asked.No response.My emotions were jumping around as I bucked the worst of the effect.  I wanted to have him to talk to, to pull me out of the mire of past feelings and into the present.  It made for a wild, disturbed kind of familiarity, almost a longing, as distorted emotions tried to find reconciliation with my head.  It ended up parsing him as if he was an old friend I was trying to reconnect with.  The same kind of weird emotional fixations that made Stockholm syndrome a thing.  Cult leaders and abusers used it.When you had nothing, you groped for anything, even if it was the person who’d brought you to that point.I’d reached out back then, too.  I’d turned to the Wards, because my mom had been the only person doing anything to keep New Wave in motion, the team had been falling apart, and I’d needed something.  Because the tests and briefings made me feel closer to Dean, reminded me of the study sessions.  Because the first time I saw her after the Endbringer attack, Vista had hugged me, because Dean, and it meant something to me that there was someone else properly upset for him.“Guys,” I said, loud enough to be heard in the next room.“Victoria?  Are you okay?” the voice was muffled.I opened my mouth to respond.  My failure to form words reminded me of talking to Dean’s parents again.I stopped myself, trying to focus and put myself in the present.  I took a deep breath that shook a little on the way in and the way out.“Step back from the wall,” I said.“Don’t,” was the immediate response.  “Don’t touch the bomb.”“I’m not touching the bomb,” I said.  “Get away from the door and the wall to the right of the door.”Snag had felt secure enough to stick his arms through the wall and not jar the bomb too badly.I’d take his cue.I put my arm through the wall, felt my forcefield go down.  I heard the exclamations.  Once I was sure I was good to move, I dragged it to one side, tearing a hole, felt one of the studs, moved it to the other side, and felt another.  About two feet of clearance between the studs.I saw the faces on the other side.  Worried.  Angry.The window shattered.  Snag reached through, seizing me by the throat.  He swung by one arm outside the building, dragging his other arm through the windows and slats, shattering them with explosive force, as he drove me toward the wall opposite the hole I’d just made.I still had my forcefield up.  He hadn’t grabbed me that hard.  Flight and forcefield together helped to stop me in my tracks.  Floorboards shattered under me, and a window beside me broke as the force was transferred out.Seizing his arm, I swung it like a bat, hurling him into the room.  I maintained my grip on him as I did it.He touched the ground with one foot, then changed trajectory.  Dust fell from the ceiling as he landed on it, upside-down, his arm still extended my way.I felt the machinery hum with activity, and tore the hand away, pushing it away from my throat and face.  The emotion effect grazed me, minor, but I hadn’t recovered from the last hit.A small kind of loss, this.  The hit didn’t do what the first had, rounding out a memory.  It did buzz through other memories.  Ones that were more minor, that I’d never put to rest.Being in the bus stop with my mom.  Weird, because it had once been a happy memory.  She’d been stitching up a cut on my forehead while I suppressed my forcefield.  The rain had been pouring, streaking the graffiti-covered walls of the bus stop.  A moment for just my mom and me.  She’d paused midway through the first aid to tell me that she was proud of me.  We’d got the guy we were after.  Then we had talked about how I’d have to change my hair for a short while to hide the stitches.  One of my first times officially out in costume.It was a memory I kept going back to.  One I’d brought up several times in the hospital.  Bittersweet somehow, and it had become more bitter and less sweet over time.It bothered me, brought me down just a bit, because it was something unresolved that had weighed on me, because I was already down a ways.“Stop,” I said.  I didn’t sound like myself.His hands freed, he reached back to his boot with one gauntlet.He threw a trio of fat shurikens at me.  My forcefield blocked them, saw them bounce off, one landing on the bed, two falling to the floor beside me.I kicked the bed to bring the more solid bedframe to where I could grab it, and rammed the end of the bed at the corner where he was.  The shurikens detonated behind me, and on the bed in front of me.  Something that wasn’t fire or anything of the sort.  Something jumped between them, like electricity but not.  Where it touched me, my heart jumped, my mind stumbled, and feelings welled.All of the doubts, fears, and hesitations inside me magnified, multiplied.  It paralyzed me for the moment.This, at least, was something I’d been trying to get a handle on.  Here, my resistance applied.He’d dropped down to the ground before the bed struck him, landing on both feet, arms spread out, hands planted on the ground.  He sprung back using his mover power, landing with one hand and one boot near the ceiling and another hand and boot beneath and on the window as he clung to the wall.With the damage I’d done to the bed already by using it as a weapon, the swipe I used to get it out of my way destroyed it, only the mattress surviving.  I still had to pick my way past a slat.He seemed surprised that I was already moving.  After pausing momentarily in shock, he used the moment of me navigating the wreckage of the bed to spring off to the right, down the hallway.I passed through the doorway, pursuing, and my head turned against my will.  I heard glass break, saw Snag vault through the window he’d broken.He was nimble, for a guy that big, but it seemed his mover power was responsible for most of it, his mechanical arms only helping with the legwork.  He was strong in many respects for what I was gathering was a multi-trigger.  Robust tinkerings, what felt like a full-fledged emotion affecting ability, a decent mover power.My attention was more on the other two further down the hallway.  Blindside, I assumed, and a hint of the pink and grey coloring to the carpet that might have been Nursery.Blindside’s bat tinked against a solid surface as they loitered there.“Damn it, Snag,” Blindside muttered.  “Running off and leaving us with this?”“He’s a character,” Nursery said.“You’re a character,” Blindside said.I could hear wet slurping sounds and I couldn’t see what was making them because Blindside was standing close to Nursery.“Stop this,” I said.  “It doesn’t end anyplace good.”I didn’t hear the response, because Snag reached up through the floorboards, seized my leg, and hauled me halfway through the floor.  I might have gone further, but I braced myself with flight and forcefield.It left me kneeling with one leg, the other stuck straight out and down through the floor, my hands on the ground in front of me.I heard Blindside’s running approach.Bat in hand, probably.  I pushed out with my aura, hoping to give them a reason to think twice, buy myself a second.Lurching to my feet, I brought Snag’s arm up above the ground.  I reached down to grab his hand, and then kicked nearer to the elbow.The mechanical arm broke off.  With a bat of my own, I shifted my grip to the wrist rather than the now-limp hand, and held my weapon out, waving the broken end of the arm in Blindside’s general direction.No blood.  I’d broken it off far enough down.  That was good.I was breathing hard, my heart was racing, and old wounds felt fresh again, but I was finding some equilibrium again.  I-The arm I was holding self-destructed, or the emotional battery within it did.  It stayed in one piece and it dashed me to pieces.Again, the ripped-out heart feeling.  Again, the heavy sense of despair.  Deeper-seated now, because I hadn’t recovered entirely from either of the other two hits, the big one and the graze.I saw double, more than double.Months and years of seeing double.  One eye on the computer screen beside me, watching the time, looking for chat notifications.  One eye on the television.  One eye on the door.Twenty past two.  Fifteen minutes late.  I counted the minutes.  Twenty one past two.Twenty two past two.  The sound from the television was almost abrasive, made to be attention-getting.I wanted to say something, protest, and I didn’t have a voice.  The computer was in arm’s reach, but it was a herculean effort to get a message out.The door opening and the wrong person being on the other side.  Just like with Dean.  It wasn’t the staff member who came on weekdays at two-oh-five when I had visitors.  It was someone else, with a face I knew, a name I didn’t, and a gentle voice that was telling me that another patient was throwing a tantrum and the facility was on lockdown, they had contacted my visitors.My visitors, my family, had decided that because they didn’t know how long the lockdown would be, they would come another day.  It was a long trip.I reached for the laptop, started to type out my message for the text-to-speech speaker, using keys that were oversized and spaced out, with screwholes in the middle of each key for knobs and joysticks to be screwed in for when other patients had their turn.  It was supposed to double as physical therapy for me, coordinating myself, making the effort to reach and reposition.The staff member had apologized, then turned to go notify other patients, closing the door behind her.  I’d tried to vocalize and of course I’d failed.  It was too long and byzantine a way from lung to mouth.The message had been left unfinished on my screen, only a few words of what I’d wanted to say.  Even completed, the statement wouldn’t have meant anything to the staff member, and they wouldn’t be able to do anything about it.  All I’d wanted to express was that my family had missed the last two visiting days as well.My eye had found the clock on the laptop, noted the ‘F’.  Friday.One eye on the clock, watching the minutes.  One eye on the television.  One eye on the F, counting the days to Monday.  One eye for the email icon on the computer screen, waiting for the apology email that would come.  When it did, I would check the time, comparing it to other apology emails, to try and figure out if they were getting further apart, less.  To see if they would stop entirely, a prelude to the visits ceasing altogether, because it was easier to forget me than to do otherwise.Something inside of me had broken at that.  I’d known it would cost me privileges.  Maybe even visits.  I’d known it would hamper or hurt other patients and staff across the hospital.  Ones who didn’t deserve it.But I had nothing else.I’d pushed out with my aura, as hard as I could, as far as I could.I pushed out with my aura, as hard as I could, as far as I could.Things had been happening while I was elsewhere.  The building shook.  The villains were gone.“Victoria!”Jasper.He was with others.  I barely recognized them.  The heroes in particular took me a second.  The kid who looked a little bit flamboyant, hair gelled back, wearing what was almost a crop top, a beast’s upper face with fangs pointing down at his chest, the lower jaw and fangs on the belt, with diagonal slashes worked into either side of both parts of the icon, painted on his abs in a faint color that might have been missed in dimmer light.  Tempera with more of the white paint on her, a bit of blood.  Fume Hood was using one hand to press a bandage to her shoulder.  Crystalclear was missing more than a few chunks from his head.  One of his eyes was exposed now, peering from between one chunk that grew from the bridge of his nose and one that grew from his temple, very blue.They looked frightened of me.That was what my aura did, really.  Another of those contextual emotional things, like the Stockholm syndrome.  Awe and admiration if they liked me, fear if they didn’t.Just fear, here.“S-stop.”Not my voice this time.  Jasper’s.I stopped.I trembled as I made myself get back to my feet.  I wiped my cheeks where they were wet.  My hair was a mess from being thrown around.  I used numb fingers to pry at it, undoing the tie.“Christ,” Mar said.For the first time, Jasper didn’t shut him up.The building shook.  Daylight reached parts of the indoors it wasn’t supposed to.  This would be their plan B.  Property damage indeed.  Lord of Loss was tearing off the roof.“We need to go,” Tempera said.I nodded.  I looked back for the hole I’d made.  I saw the teenagers in uniform in the trashed room.  They’d opened the hole the rest of the way and filed out.  Now they stood as far away from me as the room’s boundaries allowed.They would have seen me throw the bed.“Yeah,” I said.  My voice sounded hollow.The partial uniform I wore, still without the vest that I’d left outside, dusty  blood-spotted, it didn’t fit me anymore.  I felt choked by it, because I knew I’d just lost my job.I led the way down the stairs.  I stumbled in one place where a trace of Nursery’s effect made the stair a different shape, carpeted when it shouldn’t have been.  Flight helped keep me from sprawling.“You’re Glory Girl,” Landon said.I’m not, I thought.“People said you died when the Slaughterhouse Nine attacked Brockton Bay back in twenty-eleven.”“Landon,” Jasper said.  One word.The people who had been gathered inside were evacuating.  Kingdom Come wasn’t making it easy, either.  As they reached a safe distance, near where people had been protesting, they were gathering in offset rows, so we would have to move diagonally or zig-zag through their ranks to get past them.  A fence.It was hard to tell what the villains were doing when Blindside was part of the group and they were already distant, but I could turn my head and see a bit of them out of the corner of one eye.  They were backing up, moving away without actually fleeing the scene.  Nursery was creating her effect.The kids I’d brought with me were backing away, putting themselves  a distance away from us.I looked up for the branches overhead and I didn’t see them.“Watch out for Lord of Loss,” Tempera said, following my line of sight.Where was he?“He’s up there,” Crystalclear said.  “He’s changing.  Centaur?”“That’s his combat form,” I said.  I still didn’t sound like myself.  “One of them.  It’s mobile.”“I’ll keep the others busy,” Longscratch said.  He swiped one of the weapons he held, the buckler with the three swords mounted on the back, and three deep furrows appeared on the ground, stretching out beneath the feet of the crowd.“Wait,” Tempera said.Longscratch flickered, appearing momentarily at two of the points on the far side of the crowd where the furrows ended, before finalizing at the third.“Help him,” she told Crystalclear, touching his shoulder, leaving white fingerprints.  “Fume Hood, stay close.  They’re still targeting you.”Tempera moved her hand, and deposited what looked like fifty gallons of the white paint with black edges on the street.   We spread out as it appeared.  She moved her fingers, and it spread out.“Tempe!” Crystalclear shouted.  He extended one hand out to the side, pointing.The paint moved, a tidal wave, leaving a streak where it went.I chased it.Lord of Loss leaped from the rooftop.  Ten feet tall, a centaur in vague shape only.  His lower body looked more rhino-like, though the legs were longer, and he was plated in those same straps that looked like twists of smoke frozen in place, or wispy bands of metal that peeled away from him at the end.  He carried a heavy shield on one side, cut in a way that let its bottom left edge rest against the shoulder of his foreleg when he held it tilted forward, and he carried a heavy lance in the other hand.His face was a helmet, the slits for the eyes and lower face were closed up, so the face was only a series of ridges where bands met and poked out, Y-shaped.  His hair was a mane of bands left to flow like smoke.He landed in the streak of Tempera’s paint, and he lost traction, falling to one side.The paint rose up and over him, then solidified.  He shattered it, lurched to his feet.  The paint liquified and rose up and over his legs, and he shattered it again.Was it more easily than he’d shattered it the first time?Actions he repeated were supposed to be stronger.To give Tempera a hand, I threw myself forward at Lord of Loss.  Flight, forcefield up.  He twisted around and raised the shield, blocking me.  I still hit him hard enough to cost him footing.  Paint covered him, hardened.He broke the paint, swung his lance around, hitting me with the broad side.Forcefield down, impact dampened but not entirely broken.  I hit the ground and it hurt.He broke through the paint yet again, found his feet, hit me again, this time while my feet were planted on the ground.  My forcefield came back up just in time to be broken again.Yeah, that hit had been harder.Fume Hood shot him, hit him in the face.  The paint crawled up to his upper body and joints, hardened there, trying to limit his movement, and he broke it again.He laughed.  Then he hit me again.  I deflected the hit, swatting at his lance with one hand.He was advancing, pressing closer to Fume Hood, and as much as I retreated, as much as I was sure Fume Hood was backing up, he had longer legs.When he hit me yet again, pavement cracked beneath me, around my feet, the forcefield pushing the impact out and around me.  I almost lost my step backing away, with the cracked ground.Each hit stronger than the last by a significant margin.This was the point I was supposed to throw my hands up and surrender, or get out of the way.  If he decided to hit me more frequently, or if he lurched forward and kicked me with one of those feet of his after swatting me with his lance-Crystalclear had turned around, was using his blasts on Lord of Loss now.Loss, losses, losses, losses.I threw myself forward, flying, seizing him by one leg, twisting, trying to knock him over.I got him off balance, and then he hit me.  Only a moment of me holding onto him kept me from getting smacked into the ground with no forcefield.  I fell to the ground and scrambled out of the way of his legs.I waited until my forcefield was back, then threw myself at him, bowling him over.  I tore at strips, peeling away at him.In the background, Kingdom Come had abandoned his control over the crowd.  They woke as if from a deep sleep, and they seemed surprised by what was happening around them.  They fled.  Away from the brutes fighting, away from the chaos and the damaged building.He elbowed me.  It took him long enough to rise to his feet again that I was able to get in front of him again.I could do this.I needed to do this.It-It wasn’t my day to get what I wanted.  I barely registered the sound.  A crack, coinciding with the noise of the crowd.  Lord of Loss went still.My back had been turned, so I hadn’t been in a position to see it.One bullet, from somewhere nearby.  Fume Hood on the ground, Tempera beside her.It wasn’t my day to get what I wanted.I’d frozen.  A lot of people had.“Go to her,” Lord of Loss said.  “Help.  I’ll let you go if you let us go.”Numb, I nodded.“Let people know it wasn’t us.  This wasn’t our plan,” he said, behind me.I flew as much as I walked, and dropped to my knees at Fume Hood’s side.  I put my forcefield up, tried to position myself where I could be a wall for her.“Put your hands here,” Tempera told me.I did, pressing down on the stomach wound.  Blood pooled out, covering the backs of my hands.The crowd had gone still.  There was a murmuring, and people were drawing closer to watch and to see.Reminiscent of Vikare.In the background, Longscratch and Crystalclear had already apprehended the suspect.  A protester that had been in a building nearby.  Hunting rifle.  The villains were leaving.“Not-” Fume Hood grunted.“Not?” I asked.“Not a good day,” she muttered, through gasps.“No,” I agreed.  Very much agreed.Landon had come closer, and was helping by getting the first aid kit out.  Tempera took the components.“Not a good day for any of us,” Tempera said, giving the crowd a glance.                                                                                             Daybreak – 1.7                                                                                             The sun was just starting to set when the police were wrapping up with us.  They’d had to arrive first, of course, the ones who had been on the scene were compromised, victims as much as anything.Nobody Kingdom Come had affected remembered much of anything.  It was as though they’d fallen asleep – they remembered losing awareness, some reported briefly coming to in the middle of things as the building had shook or they had been knocked around, and they hadn’t really processed or understood much of those glimmers.A few had reported me as a recurring image.There was some concern that Kingdom Come might have absconded with someone or that not everyone that had been in the crowd was accounted for, but from what I could tell, it had been an all or nothing thing.  People remembered coming to, many of them dangerously close to a superhero fight in progress, but the recollections were hazy.I sat on the sidewalk near the front door of the community center, aware that it was very late in the day.  The sky was orange-yellow now, with darkness on the eastern horizon.  The thickest parts of the clouds overhead were cast in shadow, zig-zags of darkness through the amber.The heat of the day was subsiding, helped by the cloud cover.  Dust and sweat had left my arms mottled with grime and tracks where sweat had wiped it away.  I’d washed my hands after helping Fume Hood, and I’d realized I hadn’t gotten all of Tempera’s paint and the blood on the backs of my hands.  I was painfully conscious of the sweat, grime and blood, yet I couldn’t bring myself to go wash up because that would require attention to it.Paradoxical, I was well aware.I turned my attention back to the kids.  Making sure they were okay.  At some point where I had been lost in thought, Gilpatrick had showed up.  I watched until he glanced my way.  He raised a hand, and I raised mine.  Then he turned his attention back to the teenagers.  As it should be.I’d figured I would be working late.  I’d just thought it would be paperwork and talking to the students.  I’d really liked that part.  It was fascinating stuff when it wasn’t so close to home.I could relax some, seeing Gilpatrick.  Not because it meant great things, but because it meant I didn’t have to think about finding Gil after, getting the details, putting off hearing the news or delivering the essential details.I put my hands behind me where I wouldn’t see the blood or the places where the paint had settled into the cracks, oil-black, and I leaned back, eyes closed, trying to focus on the voices and the sounds, on the breezy wind and the ambient warmth.“I’m sorry,” Gilpatrick said.  He’d approached me.I kept my eyes closed.  I said, “Are the students okay?  The others?”“They’re fine.  Some have parents here, I’ve got a bus coming for the others.  Psychologically, emotionally, I don’t know.  It was scary and it was hard to know what was happening.  The staff of the community center are obviously upset about the building, but that’s not on us.”I opened my eyes.Gilpatrick wasn’t wearing his vest.  A sleeveless undershirt tucked into black pants, a sweatshirt slung over one shoulder.  Bald, bushy eyebrows, hairy, hairy arms.“Jasper filled me in on most of it,” he said.  “He’s reliable when it counts, it seems.”“He’s a good guy,” I agreed.  “There’s a reason I wanted him with me.”“I get it now, I think.”“If you want this project to be a positive thing, at least at our school, you’ll want more Jaspers.  You wanted a verdict on the kids you sent with me?  I wouldn’t put them in leadership roles.  Not if there are going to be capes on scene.  What I heard and saw wasn’t very positive, and if there were any who disagreed, they didn’t feel confident enough to say it out loud.”Gilpatrick ran his hand over the skin of his head, not giving me a response.My arms were tired from propping myself up.  I leaned forward instead.“Alright.  Thanks.  Not good to hear, but I appreciate it,” he said.  “I’ll take that under serious advisement.”“They follow orders, at least.”“I was really hoping to have more hands to help out,” he said.  “Really unfortunate.”Some parents were joining students who were talking to the police.  I watched them.  Parent and child side by side, parents concerned as they listened, getting the details at the same time the officers were.“I am sorry this happened,” Gilpatrick said.  “I meant it when I said it.  I mean it now.”“I gave my point-by-point retelling of events to the police,” I said.  I stared at my hands.  “Including the part where I was hit by a few emotion-affecting attacks.  It’ll take some of the responsibility off your shoulders, if anyone asks.”“It’s not that important,” he said.  “Well, it’s important, obviously, thank you, but I don’t want to dwell on that.  If people make an issue out of it, I’ll handle it.  I knew what I was doing when I brought you on board.  That’s not what I want to talk to you about.”“I stuck around,” I said.  “To be something like a guardian for the students who were acting as witnesses, making sure they weren’t pressed too hard or made uncomfortable.  I stopped when I realized being there was making some things harder, because they didn’t like being around me, or that it looked like I was trying to protect myself by inserting myself into things and influencing their testimony.”“Yeah,” Gilpatrick said.“I backed off, Jasper and Landon took my cues, I think.”“That’s good.”I thought that’d be the time he followed the thread of the conversation and got around to saying what he needed to say.  He didn’t.There was a break in the convo.  More cars were pulling into spaces along either side of the ‘square’ of grass, sidewalk, and fountain in front of the community center.  Some more parents.“Did they mention Fume Hood?” I asked.“Only that she was taken to the hospital and all signs were good when she left.  Tempera was staying close to her.  Something to do with paint?”No news then.  “Tempera stopped the worst of the blood loss.  She poured paint in the wound, shaped it, and solidified it.  We might have lost Fume Hood in another way, though.  We might not keep her as a hero after this.”“Did she say that?”“There was a brief twilight between when the pain meds kicked in and when the meds knocked her out,” I said.  I moved my fingers, felt how unlike skin the backs of my hands felt, stiff with the stuff I hadn’t managed to wash off.  I’d rushed, because I’d wanted to get back to keeping an eye on the students from the patrol group.“Are you going to finish that thought?” Gilpatrick asked, his voice soft.I closed my eyes.  “Um.  We chatted.  She said she was staying with a family member already, so she’d have someone to look after her if she needed it.”Thinking about family pulled my thoughts in a few different directions.  I could have tried picking a safer one, but I wasn’t sure I was that on the ball, being as tired and discouraged as I was.I went on, “Her brother cut ties with her when she went villain.  She was living in that area where all the building foundations were screwed up because they were rushed, and everyone had to leave the homes they’d just settled in, reached out to her brother, and she’s been staying with him, reconnecting.  It might give me some hope for her, having that positive influence, but she sounded pretty cynical about it all when we had the conversation right after meeting, before everything happened.”“Cynicism is understandable, to a degree.  That’s where she’s at.  Where are you at, Victoria?”“Similar to Fume Hood, really.  I wasn’t evicted because of rushed apartment construction, but I’ve been staying with my dad because it means we each pay half the rent, and I want to keep my options open with things being what they are.”“I wasn’t talking about living accommodations,” Gilpatrick said.  “Your head, your heart.  Are there any lingering effects from the emotion effect?”“For the last two years,” I whispered.“Sorry?  I didn’t catch that,” he said.“It’s gone.  It really sucked while it was in effect, but it’s gone.  Right now I’m in that heavyhearted, almost-blameless-but-guilty ‘morning after’ phase, where I’m reflecting on everything I did when I was under the influence,” I said.“I know that well enough.  I’ve been hit a few times by those, back when I was a squaddie and squad leader.  And by you, once.”“You asked me to,” I pointed out, looking up at Gilpatrick, “and this was a bad one.  Snag?  I read about a thing online, keeping tabs on who was out there.  I’m pretty sure he’s part of a new multitrigger cluster.  It might have been amplified by the tinkering, if it wasn’t, then something else was in play.  That didn’t hit me like it was a minor or secondary power.”“Sorry,” he said.He wasn’t a bad guy.  I wanted to be angry but I couldn’t justify it.“I’m sorry it happened like this,” he said.  “It wasn’t supposed to be anything like this.  I thought it’d get a bit nasty with the civilian protesters but I didn’t think it’d be anything like this.  Not the capes, not the gunshot at the end.”I hadn’t either.“Jasper said you guessed why I sent those students with you.”“Yeah,” I said.  I climbed to my feet.“I’m especially sorry for that,” he said.  “If it was up to me, I wouldn’t have ever tested you like that.  It wasn’t wholly up to me.”“Who?” I asked.“Everyone,” he said.  “No-one.  It’s complicated.  Wardens and the hero teams are being pressured to be mindful of who is out there, touching base, and they reached out to some of the other patrol groups with concerns.  They wanted to coordinate, so teenagers wouldn’t be out interviewing or exposing themselves to anyone dangerous.  School got to talking, and they got into CYA mode.”“Cover your ass,” I said.“They wanted to be able to say that they’d made a reasonable effort to check that the parahumans the students were exposed to were reasonable and safe, in case anything happened down the line.  I could have kept quiet about you, but…”He trailed off.“I wouldn’t have asked you to,” I said.“…I didn’t get the impression you wanted me to, either.  You weren’t being secretive.  I don’t want to operate that way, either.”“No.  I wouldn’t want you to,” I said.“You know I can’t keep you on the staff,” he said.I nodded.There it was.Fuck.I hadn’t been super attached to the job, but… fuck.“Using power on kids, the contention about possible conflict of interest, undue influence, danger.  I think things will stay at that, I don’t think it’ll follow you.”I nodded.“There’s a dim chance of a student claiming emotional distress because of your aura and pursuing things in court, I’ve already talked to one officer to get them on board and we’ll get something in writing.  I’ll vouch for you and for the events as Jasper described them, one hundred percent, if you end up needing someone to stand for you.  None of this was you.”“Courts are a million years behind as it stands, and getting further behind every day we don’t have an established system of government,” I said.  “By the time things get that far it’ll be forgotten.”“That is a factor,” Gilpatrick said.I wasn’t worried about that side of things.  I was hurt, but I wasn’t worried.“Do you need a hand getting things cleared out of the office?” he asked.I shook my head.  I didn’t want to think about that.“Can-” I started.  I cleared my throat.  “Can I get back to you on that?  I’ve- I guess I’ve got a family thing I should go to.”“For sure,” he said.  “Anytime outside of usual school or work hours.”I might have flinched in a way that he saw, hearing that.  I knew why he’d said it, but it still sucked to hear.I started to walk away.“Victoria,” he said.“Yeah?”“Any favor you need, reference letter, intel, if you need Jasper or some other trustworthy faces in uniform to lend a hand with something…”“Thank you,” I said, my voice lighter and more cheerful than I felt.  “I’ll be in touch.”I took off.⊙There was something very human about the desire to gather around a fire.  Power rationing meant every household had only a certain amount, more if there were more people in the house.  Conversely, there was a lot of cheap firewood.  Streetlights flickered on, and many house lights went off.  In back yards there were three other families on the city block that were gathering around fire pits.  Two of the families were playing different kinds of music, but it wasn’t too discordant.  There were trees in each yard, front and back, and that helped to dampen the sound.The entire street smelled like burning charcoal, and the light from the streetlights was just a little bit hazy with the ambient smoke.It was a nice neighborhood, even if it had what I felt was the artificial quality.  Houses with character, sufficiently different from one another in style and architecture, but still so new that they looked more like movie sets than lived-in places.  Time and clutter would wear at those crisp edges.  Paint and attention would turn fences of new wood with the occasional edge still frayed from the saw’s touch into something more personal.This was the flip side to the hostility and the street-wide gap between protester and community center.  Boyfriend and girlfriend sat on an outdoor love seat together, arms around each other, bathed in fire’s warmth.  Friends sat and talked, beers in hand.  Kids in another yard played with their dog.With the path I’d taken, I reached the backyard first.  The driveway was wider than it was long, crushed gravel, with room for multiple vehicles, and a fence stretched from the house at one corner to the garage at the other.  My mom had invited neighbors, so it was a thing, even if things had reached a more relaxed point.My dad sat on one of the lawn chairs, fire pit in front of him with the fire having burned down to just glowing coals.  The barbecue was to his right, lid open, tiny bits of meat clinging to the grill.He was forty-two but looked younger.  The fact that he was as fit as he was played into it- only the white in his beard stubble really gave it away.  His hair, too, was short.  He was the only one who hadn’t put a sweatshirt or jacket on, owing to the proximity of the two heat sources- he was wearing a t-shirt that was form-fitting in a way that showed off his muscles.  Pretty darn gross, given he was a dad,  my dad, and he was supposed to dress his age.  I would have insisted on clothes that hid any sign of muscle at all, really, had I been given a say.He looked relaxed though.  As relaxed as I’d seen him in a while, really, and I’d seen him passed out on the couch back at the apartment.I was aware that my mom had seated herself so that two neighbors sat between her and my dad.  Where my dad had dressed in a t-shirt and sports pants for the occasion, she had dressed up.  Just a bit of lipstick, her hair short and styled, a ruffly sort of white blouse and pencil skirt.  She’d kicked off her shoes earlier in the evening, leaving them beneath her chair.I was aware of the distinction in how they’d dressed, too.  In another time, before everything, there would have been more… connection, I supposed.  Each influencing the other, until they matched more.She was smiling.  She folded one knee over the other, then a moment later was undoing the position, both feet on the porch again as she leaned forward, laughing at something someone had said.I smiled.The lights were on inside the house, too.  The door was open, and people were scattered through the space between the stairs down to the porch, the back hallway, and the kitchen on the other side of the hallway.  The room to the left of the hallway was dark.  The neighbors kids, I presumed, teens to twenty-somethings.  I saw a glimpse of Crystal stepping into the unlit room, tried to catch her eye with a raised hand as she looked toward the window, and failed.I did get the attention of someone sitting next to my mom, though.  She touched my mom’s arm and pointed.I remained where I was, arms folded on the top of the wooden-slat fence, chin on my hands, while my mom approached.“You’re hurt,” she said, touching my arm, where the road rash was.“Scuffed up.”“Did you get the other guy?” she asked.  She reached out and touched my hair, fixing it by moving strands to one side.“No,” I said.  “But there were five of them.”“Do you want to talk about it?  I’m interested.”“Not really,” I said.  “Today-”My breath caught.“-Kind of not a good day,” I said.I saw her expression change, even though the light source was behind her.“What?” I asked.  “Don’t tell me you didn’t save me the dessert you promised.  Looking forward to that is pretty much the only thing keeping me going right now.”She smiled, touching my cheek, before kissing me on the forehead.  “I saved you dessert with extras to take home, in case you want pie or pastries for breakfast tomorrow.”“You’ve done your duty then,” I said, with mock seriousness.“It’s been a long time since I’ve failed a mission,” she said, in the same tone.  She put her hand on the side of my head.  “You missed Uncle Mike, I’m afraid.”“Oh shoot,” I said.  “I barely remember him.  How is he?”“He’s Uncle Mike.  He brought his wife and your cousins, and I haven’t child-proofed at all.  It was… something, in the brief time he was here.  A whirlwind of chaos and emotion, and then he was gone.”“Ah, too bad,” I said.In the background, my dad was trying to get my attention.  He’d sat up, and didn’t look relaxed anymore.  He offered me a small smile.  I acknowledged him by lifting one hand up from where it sat on my elbow, in a mini-wave.“Thank you for coming,” my mom said.  “I know the family stuff is hard, after everything, but it means so much to me.  To everyone.”“I’m here for the desserts,” I said.  I amended it to, “…and a bit for family.”My mom lightly rapped me on the side of the head before stepping away.  “Come on in, then.  Meet people, I’ll get your pie.”As she stepped over to the gate by the garage to unlock it, Crystal stepped out into the backyard, joined by a few others in our age group.  She glanced in my direction, saw me, and froze like a deer in the headlights.Her arms folded, defensive, like something was wrong.She mouthed words at me, and I couldn’t see her face well enough at a distance to know what the words were, but I could draw conclusions from context.My dad’s posture, still sitting upright now, both feet planted on the ground.My mom’s earlier change in expression.  Even the wording-I backed away from the fence a few steps.  My mom froze, the gate only slightly open.“You invited her,” I said.  I wasn’t talking about Crystal.In reaction to that, my mother didn’t look confused, she didn’t negate.  She looked toward the house, to see what I’d seen that had clued me in.Whirlwind of fucking chaos and emotion indeed.“You invited her,” I said, again.  More emotional this time.  “She’s in the house?”My mother rallied, composing herself.  Now she looked confused.  “I told you I invited everyone.”“She’s actually in the house,” I said.I backed away again, and my mother threw the gate open, taking several steps on the driveway, stepping on crushed gravel with bare feet.I raised my hand, indicating for her to stop.  She continued forward.I threw my aura out, one push.My mother stopped.  Crystal stopped in her tracks, already at the fence.  People rose from their seats.“I thought you knew,” she said.  “I very clearly said everyone.  It was supposed to be a family reunion with everyone getting together again for the first time in… in a really long time.”“You’re a lawyer,” I said.  “You’re too clever with wording to be that fucking stupid.”“Please,” she said, with a tone like she was the one who needed to exercise patience and restraint here.  “Let’s keep things civil.”I couldn’t even look at her.  I trembled as my eyes dropped to the ground.“I’ve made mistakes, as your sister has,” my mother said.  “She’s been doing so well.  I want to make up for past wrongs and be a mother to both of you, like I should have been from the beginning.”I looked up, staring at her.The lipstick, the composed outfit, the words, the everything about this all seemed so false now, so forced.  I didn’t even recognize her.“You’re kind of fucking it up,” I said, in the kind of whisper that was the only tone I could manage that wasn’t outright screaming at her.  My hands were clenched at their sides.“That’s not fair.”“You’re kind of really fucking it up,” I said, in the same strangled whisper.“Victoria-”“You’re fucking it up, mother,” I said.  “You’re fucking- you’re fucking- did dad play along with this?”“I told him everyone was coming.  You, your sister, Crystal, Uncle Mike.  He was surprised, but… pleasantly surprised.”Dad too, then.  There was that heart-wrenched-out feeling again.  I screwed my eyes shut, inadvertently squeezing out tears.  I was aware her neighbors were seeing.“Don’t- don’t get emotional, Victoria,” my mom said.  “Please, I didn’t do this to hurt you.  The furthest thing from it.”“You fucked that up too,” I whispered.“Stop saying that.  Please,” my mother said.  “It’s the age of second chances, she’s worked very hard to get to this point.  I’ve talked to people who worked with her and she’s getting back into her routine in a good way.  I want all of us to have a second shot at this, and do it right this time.”I shook my head.“Leaving things as unresolved as they are is doing more harm than good.  To both you and to her.”“So you thought you’d invite me to dinner and surprise me with her, and you thought there was nothing I could say or do because people are here?”“You’re putting thoughts and conspiracy in my head,” she said.  “I want you to be sisters again.  I want us to be a family again.”“That’s not for you to decide,” I said.  “Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.”“Please, don’t wind yourself up.  You’re getting out of breath.  Let’s communicate.  Please.”I was getting out of breath.  I gulped in a breath of air.  “You’re aware I can’t set foot in that house again, right?  I’ll see her looming in the shadows, potentially another surprise invite.”“I want you to find reconciliation, so you wouldn’t feel upset even if she did appear by surprise.”“I can’t accept any invites from you,” I said.  My face started to contort, and I forced it back into something more normal before I lost the ability to see my mother or focus on her altogether.  “I can’t grab dessert from you or do anything with you again because she might be there, surprise.  I can’t trust you.  How can I trust you again?”“I’m sorry you feel that way.  I did not realize that was where things stood.  You’ve been doing so well, and she’s been doing well.”“How-” I started.  I gulped in another breath of air.  My voice was a whisper again when I managed to speak again.  “How do you not realize when you saw me at the hospital?  How do you even think rec- how do you think this is ever possible?  How does-”I closed my eyes.  More tears.“How does Dad?  How could you see me then, how could you- how- how-”My chest hurt.“Crystal-” I said, I looked toward the house.Crystal was still on the porch.  Standing guard by the back door, red shield up.  She watched me talking with my mom over one shoulder.“I told Crystal the same thing I told your father.  She was skeptical but she agreed it was for the best.”I didn’t trust my mom’s version of events on that.  Crystal at least had my back in this moment.I tried to find words, and I didn’t have the oxygen.“Catch your breath.  We can talk this out.”I worked at it, swallowing air.“I’ll wait,” she said.The sound of her voice made it harder, not easier.When I spoke, my voice was very small.  It gained more strength as I went.“How can you have not been there, missed visits, or come to the visit and spend more time talking to doctors than to me because it was hard to be around me?  How can you have come to see me then, and have had to avert your eyes mid-conversation with me, and found that hard, and not realize that I had to live it for two years, and had that be a million times harder for me?”“I know it was hard, honey.  I get it, I really do.  But you can’t dwell in the past.  It’s not good for you.  You can’t carry that.”“You say that, when you still sleep with the lights on,” I said.It was her turn to not have words.“That’s different,” she said, finally.  She didn’t say how it was different.I stared at her.“I want all of us to conquer our demons,” she said.  “I think you want that too.”I continued to stare.Finally, I said, “I want that too.”“We can talk this out.  We can find things we all want,” she said.  “We can make inroads on this.”She looked nearly as upset as I felt, even as composed as she was.But in the end, and I’d known this from very early on, seeing her with- with her, she wasn’t a whole and complete person.  She tried, she put on a good face, but my mother had been broken long, long ago, and with the way she’d put herself together, she retained only sufficient compassion, understanding, and empathy for a very small number of people.  For one daughter, at most.Second chances.  Second go-around, and I wasn’t that daughter, this time.“In the interest of putting my demons to rest,” I said.  “I’m going to keep my distance.  Don’t call, because I can’t trust a thing you say.  I’ll figure out what I’ll do about Dad later.”“Don’t,” she said.  “Nothing gets better if you close off communication.”There were things I wanted to say to that.It wasn’t worth it.I turned to go.I heard the gravel under her feet as she gave chase, and I pushed out with my aura, hard.“Do not use your power on me, Victoria Dallon.  That has never been okay, and it doesn’t work anyway.”I drew in a deep breath.  There were things I wanted to say to that, too.I settled for, “Let me go.  If you follow me, I’m liable to hit you with something harder than my aura.  I’m pretty sure that would work.”It might have been a good line, if I hadn’t been choking back emotion as I said it.I walked away.  I didn’t trust myself to fly when I couldn’t see straight.  Having a panic attack in the air made for an embarrassing moment.People stood in rows at the fences that bounded their yards, staring and watching.  I wiped away my tears once, then resolved not to shed more, not where people could see.  I set my jaw.In the background, I could hear my father’s raised voice.Breathe.  Center yourself.  Move forward.  Plan.I thought about what I’d need to do next.  I couldn’t go back to the apartment I shared with my dad.For the time being, I only walked, out in the general direction of the water.  Streetlights lit up in advance of imminent cars and as I stepped onto the streets, turning off otherwise.  Here and there they would turn on for wildlife, illuminating a lost deer or raccoon mid-scurry down the road.  We’d set ourselves up so abruptly that the animals were still confused.It was getting cooler.  I wore my skirt, my clothes from earlier.  My forcefield shielded against the wind, which kept it from lowering the temperature even further, but it didn’t do a lot to shield me from the ambient heat or lack thereof.I tensed as I heard running footsteps behind me.  I stopped in my tracks.Not Crystal.  She would have flown, and she would have set down well in front of me.  She wouldn’t have chased, maybe.Her, then.I didn’t want to look.  I didn’t want to speak to her.I pushed out with my aura, instead.Another footstep, closer.Our mother’s daughter.I threw my arm back and to the side, a backhand swipe.  I tore through lawn, through slabs of sidewalk, and the edge of the road.  Dirt flew across the street alongside clumps of grass and chunks of sidewalk.A long pause, and then I heard the footsteps again, running.  This time the other way.⊙Gilpatrick jumped as I appeared in the doorway of his office, nearly knocking over a paper container of noodles in red sauce that rested on a stack of paper.  Paperwork I would have been helping him with, had the day gone differently.“Victoria?  What’s wrong?” he asked.So it was that obvious something was wrong.“I need to call in a favor,” I said.Okay, hearing my voice, I could get why he’d known.  I sounded like another person entirely.“If it’s okay,” I said.“Of course it’s okay,” he said.  “What’s wrong?  Are you cold?  The temperature dropped steeply tonight.  What can I get you?  Sit.”He stood, circling around his desk.  I backed away a little as he did, which was his cue to stop.I wasn’t sure how to respond, how to ask.“By the way,” he said.  “As far as I’m concerned, there’s no need to count.  I consider you a friend, and I feel like a piece of shit for setting you up to fail like that.”“It’s not that,” I said.  “I just need a place to stay tonight.  While I figure some things out.  I’ll be gone before the students arrive first thing.”I noted the hesitation before he responded.“Sure,” he said.“You paused.”“Only because it’s not really a great place for staying overnight.  You could come to my apartment, but that’s-”“I kind of want space to think,” I said.  “Offer’s appreciated.”“There’s an issue with power rations and temperature is supposed to drop a few more degrees, and this place isn’t insulated well.  It was a bitch last winter.”“I remember,” I said.“Of course,” Gilpatrick said.He kept giving me very deeply concerned looks.  Almost pity.I really hated those.  I’d had a lifetime’s fill and then some.“Okay,” he said.  “I’ve got a space heater right by my desk here.  You’ll want to be careful if you’re leaving it running for a while, fire hazard.”“I’ll be careful,” I said.“There are blankets we stowed in the locker rooms that you can use if you want to sleep.  You could get something serviceable if you gather a bunch.  I laundered them not too long ago, too.”“I know where to find them.”“There are candles too, in case the power runs out.  But again, fire hazard.”“It’s okay,” I said.  “I’ll be careful.”“Okay,” he said.  “You sure you don’t want company?  We can talk it out, if you haven’t eaten I can go grab something, or…”I was already shaking my head.“Sure,” he said.  “I was needing an excuse to go home, this will do.  Unless maybe I should stay around?  You could settle in upstairs, and I’ll be all the way down here, you can have your space to think and you can still have me to talk to in case you decide you need it.”“No,” I said.  “Don’t let me keep you.  Go home.  You’ll have angry parents to talk to first thing tomorrow, once they’ve figured out what happened and had time to get angry.”He frowned.  “Yeah.”“Please,” I said.  “I know where everything is.”“Yeah,” he said.  “You sure you’re okay?  You’re not going to…”He trailed off.“If I was going to do anything, I’d take someone out with me.”He scrutinized me.“I’m worried here, for the record,” he said.“I’ll manage,” I said.  “I’ve managed this far.”“You have my number,” he said.“Yeah.”“You call if you need anything.”“Yeah.”“And you… be here in the morning when I show up.  Which will be well before the kids do.”“Yeah,” I said.“Okay,” he said.He gathered up his paper container, a stack of his papers.  He was trying to pick up the remainder when I approached, picking it up myself.Silent, I walked him to his car, handing over the papers when it was time.  I walked inside and locked the door behind me.  The place was big and it was dark, with the open gymnasium space unlit.I carted the space heater upstairs, and then I got the blankets.  I got the candles and the matches, and then I found the file boxes, collapsed and gathered in piles.I situated myself in my office, which wasn’t technically my office anymore, and I set to making the boxes, pulling my things off the shelves, and getting them stowed away.The space heater hummed and the computer monitor clicked, as I periodically checked something or followed up on something I’d seen on a file.I made a stack of the things I wanted to read, the files that intrigued or that I’d forgotten about, the magazines I liked.  I was a third of the way through my shelves, twelve boxes filled, when I finally settled down in my chair, pulling blankets over me, and started to read.I got about two pages read before deciding I didn’t have it in me to read more.I didn’t have it in me to sit still, when my anxieties were churning.I stood, dropping blankets on the floor, and walked over to the window.  With the cold, the space heater, and the imperfect seal, moisture and fog had collected on it.I reached out toward the window, a foot away from touching it.  I turned on my forcefield.A pause.Then a handprint on the window, in the condensation.  Then another.A circular smudge that streaked, a naked breast pressed against the glass, moving.Then the mark that couldn’t be anything but one half of a face, beneath the circular smudge.They moved, and I wasn’t asking them to move.  The window rattled a bit as it was pushed against. The prints smudged.A fingernail dragged against the glass, and produced a high pitched squeal, almost ear-splitting.I dropped the forcefield.  I sank back into my seat, and it protested the landing.Not a second trigger.  I was well aware of that.  When I’d first had my forcefield, it hadn’t protected my costume.  I had two theories as to why.The first theory was that I’d grown, and the boundaries that the forcefield used to define ‘me’ had changed.  I’d breathe out, breathe in, gain a pound here, lose a pound there, and it would adjust for the maximum bounds.  It didn’t explain how my skirt was often protected, but I’d mused on that too, that my legs moved, my hair had been long at one point, I’d been shorter…I’d been that, the forcefield had adjusted, and that was the new upper bound of what I was, forever with me.It felt thin, as theories went.The second theory was that it was the Manton effect, that broad-as-bells term for the built in protections and limitations of the power.  The theory was that the built-in protections of the power only protected what I saw as a part of me, and it had taken some time before the costume was that much a part of my identity.That that was me, now, as much as the costume I wore.I couldn’t be that.  I couldn’t sit still and be crushed under the weight of that thing.I needed to do something, and taking books off the shelves felt like it was moving backward, not forward.I spun around in my seat, and I loaded up the webpage.  Something to do.  Methodically filling out details on the group I’d seen, researching, filling myself in, and letting others know what they were up against.Something constructive to keep me occupied until the power ran out, or until I was so tired I had no choice but to sleep.                                                                                             Daybreak – 1.8                                                                                             



Daylight streamed in at a low angle as I stepped back into my office.  The light was blurred as it came through the condensation on the window, spotted with dots of darkness due to the melted frost that still clung to the window’s surface in lines and constellations of droplets.  Ninety percent of my books were packed up, the boxes that were still here were stacked near the door and the bookshelf, labeled in thick marker, with shorthand notes on the most interesting and essential files within written on the boxes in pen.  I’d left a few of the more interesting files available.  I’d put them in a box on their own, in case I needed something to read.My phone was plugged into the computer.  I checked it, and made a small and sleepy pump of my fist as it lit up.  Then I saw the red number on the digital-display dial, and let my hand drop.  Missed messages: too many.It wasn’t that I cared that much about the phone.  It was that the phone being on meant there was power again.  That the power was on again meant I could turn the space heater on.  I flicked the switch, turned on my computer, then lit the candles for what little good heat they offered and wrapped a blanket around me before settling in my computer chair.I was freshly showered, towel around my hair, and I’d gotten dressed in a slightly musty spare change of clothes.  I had a blanket, candles, and a computer booting up.  I watched as it started the struggle of fighting every other computer out there that was wanting a piece of the web.There were worse ways to take things easy on myself.I slid my to-do list across the desk until it was beside my keyboard.  I’d need a car.  Plenty of people were willing to offer the use of theirs in order to pay for fuel.  Food, a place to stay.Living accommodations might be tricky.  Demand was high, and it was a pretty steep drop in quality from the central areas and the fringes.  Many companies were putting up five or more houses a day or an apartment complex over the course of a week, slapping them together like there was a gun to their heads.  When it came time to find renters, they were more interested in filling the spaces fast.  They had no reason to answer questions or have a potential buyer investigating the nooks and crannies or checking the plumbing if they could turn that person away and have someone else on their doorstep within minutes.It was a minefield.  Word of mouth, cash, contacts, or luck were required to get a proper house that wouldn’t start falling apart after the fact.  Fume Hood was one of the ones who’d been unlucky.In more than one way.My homepage was parahumans online, though.  On top of the missed calls and messages on my phone, I had a slew on the site.♦  Unread Private Messages from NW_Brandish (2)

Glitzglam *New Message*: I knew something was up and tried to call but no answer? & then you didn’t show so I let my guard down. I thought u knew and had cold feet and was relieved



Glitzglam *New Message*: I am so sorry. I had no part in this. I should have been smarter. I did not know really trulyI marked it as unread and minimized it.  I didn’t want to think about it for the moment.News.  Inquiry into the circumstances of Lachlan Hund.  Not a trial, but an inquiry, some questions by people with more official standing.  He’d fallen in with some sketchy people, and there were thoughts about there being powers involved.The inquiry was the story of the hour, it seemed.  Heroes stood by to step in and take him away to get help if officials were suspicious he’d been manipulated, but it was sounding like he would go home with his new family.  That sucked.Other articles, further down the pages.  Fume Hood was alive, and she was a contentious topic.  The actions on the part of the shooter seemed to have split people into two factions, with the ones supporting Fume Hood slightly edging out the ones who condemned her.  Strange to see.I wanted more info on her situation, and unfortunately, that was all I got.I added another note to my to-do list.  I’d reach out to Fume Hood, check in.  I’d satisfy my curiosity and nag her about the name choice, which I’d been meaning to do but hadn’t had the chance to.My eye traveled up to the unread messages.  Crystal’s responses.It all felt like I was taking a massive backward step.  Like I was back in the immediate aftermath of Gold Morning.  Two legs, two arms, bewildered, emotional.  I was bothered, upset.  I didn’t know what to do with myself.I’d been angry at my parents then too.  For various reasons.  Angry at a lot of people and things.I hadn’t and didn’t want that to define me.I clicked on Crystal’s account name again.Glitzglam *New Message*: I am so sorry. I had no part in this. I should have been smarter. I did not know really trulyPoint_Me_@_The_Sky: S’okay.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I know how these things go.



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I saw this sort of thing play out when it wasn’t aimed at me.   I can read between the lines and speak Carol-ese and I picked up on what she was saying about you being skeptical about the situation



Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I absolve you on the condition of one get together where we have some good eating, your treat, and you need to let me know if you hear of any good apartments or things because I am not good going back to my dadsI drummed my fingers on my desk, mused that my motivations might have to do with my being hungry.More news articles.  Some capes were taking on roles as icons and iconoclasts for the various movements in the civilian sectors.  Four hero teams led the ‘icon’ groups.  Advance Guard, Foresight, the Shepherds and the Attendant.The first two were aimed at pushing forward.  New approaches, doing things right this time.  The opinions on what that way forward looked like it differed, feeding into the division between the two groups.Things were changing.  The Shepherds and Attendant had been groups divided along similar lines, but the Shepherds were self-combusting, and the remaining members were folding into the Attendant.  There was some debate over what the name of the resulting team would be.And then there were three, I thought.I idly browsed, caught between liking the Shepherd’s aesthetic and icons better while liking the Attendant’s mindset of moving slowly, with caution.  I was suspicious it might end up being the opposite.  As it was, the Attendant’s approach tacked on a bit too much ‘remember what we lost’ for my liking, clinging to the past, being defined by it, but-There was a knock on the door.“Come in,” I said.Gil opened the door.  He had two coffees in a tray in one hand and a bag in the other, and he had to juggle them both as he opened the door.I rose to my feet.“Sit,” he said.  He nearly dropped his drink as he saw the boxes.  “Shit on me, you’re packed.”“I’ll be done in time to be gone before the students turn up,” I said, sitting.“I’m not so concerned about that right now,” he said.  He put the bag and coffees on the desk.  “How are you?”I shrugged.“You look better.”I had a headache from not sleeping and not eating, and from the post-stress hangover, but I also felt lighter than air in a euphoric, fragile way.  It was as if I’d just gotten over a bad round of the flu, and I was at the point where I was getting over the worst of it, but if I did the wrong thing or tested my body in the wrong way I’d be sick and hurting again.Better.I shrugged again.  “Yeah.  That word could apply.”“Did you sleep at all?”I snorted air out of my nose.  “I’ll sleep when I’m so tired I have no other choice.”“But you’re feeling better than you were?”“Yeah.  Better than I was.  Thanks for letting me stay over,” I said.He pulled a breakfast burger out of the paper bag, and my eyes must have lit up, because he smiled, passing it to me.A double-decker English muffin, with bacon, two eggs, lettuce, tomato and very sharp mustard.I wasn’t normally one to eat egg, but I didn’t let that stop me.I’d taken too big of a bite.  I swallowed hard.It was good.  Visceral.  Like Snag’s power, the hit of emotion as I enjoyed it was like a bit of metal, closing an electrical connection.  Rounding off a thought I hadn’t wanted to make.Feeding tubes.  The insertions, the removals.  The tube being there, one eye watching the beige fluid moving through steadily.  Really wanting something good.  Going almost four months without, because they weren’t sure I could.  Then having it be a chore.  It had been better than the alternative, but a chore, to force myself to eat it right, to chew it thoroughly enough.I swallowed hard again, not because I had another bite to swallow.Gilpatrick was looking at my files and notes, his back to me, my English muffin sandwich in my hands.He glanced at me, saw the blinking, and looked away.  “If you want to talk, I’m all ears.”“I don’t, thank you,” I said.  “I had a bad day, the part you knew about, then it got worse.  Now I’m trying to get centered.”He nodded.“This is really good,” I said.“They are, I took a bite of mine in the car and then ate it before I got here,” he said.  He bent over a box, looking at the notes.  “Man, I wish I still had access to these files and books.  I’d try bribing you if I could do it in good conscience.”I swallowed again.  “They’re mine and I’m too straightlaced to be bribed.  You can call me if you want to ask about any of it.”“Then I owe you more favors, am I right?”“I thought we weren’t counting anymore,” I said.He didn’t respond to that.  He picked up a file, paging through it.“Which one is that?”“Ossuary.  Why leave it out?”“They’re back, or they will be soon,” I said.  “Activist villains with a heavy focus on environment.  They wouldn’t call themselves villains, I don’t think.  Long list of really messy executions, longer list of leaders with very short tenures, who try to pull a very disparate group together, fail, and abdicate.”“Were they the ones who used to call themselves Elephant Graveyard?”“That’s the one.  One of the early leaders pushed the name change along with a shift away from focusing on animals and animal welfare,” I said.  “I liked Elephant Graveyard more, I think.  Clunky, but clunky in a way that stands out, and it made for really good imagery, when they left a spray painted calling card.”“I don’t want to pry,” Gilpatrick said.“About Ossuary?”“About you.  I spent a while thinking about what to do.  I’ve had some good bosses and bad bosses over the years.  When you throw yourself into the fray like you do when you’re a PRT squaddie, you really need to know that the people above you are looking out for you.  That your back is covered.”“Yeah,” I said.  Same applied to family, to parents.“I don’t want to push boundaries or cross any lines, and I don’t want to ask the wrong thing.  When you say you don’t want to talk, can I ask why?  Any answer you gave could help me make sure I’m covering your back as you move on to better things.”“Because I’d have to fill you in on years of background and that’s not stuff I want to relive,” I said.“Ah.”“Because it’s confidential, because it’s messy, because… as cool as a guy as you can be, you can’t make it better.  You can’t give me the answers or guidance I need because there’s a whole ream of things that’s separate and aside from the years of my background that you’d need to get into or know and… I’m going overboard with this.”“I do want to hear,” he said.  “Anything else?”“That’s mostly it,” I said.He nodded.  He rubbed his head for a second, thinking.  “You want company?”“Nah,” I said.  “I’d just be packing the last few boxes.  I wouldn’t mind a hand getting them out to the car, just to speed things up when the time comes.”“You have a car?”“I’ll get someone off of a listing or something.  I’ve got to figure out what I’m doing, so there’s that too.  I wouldn’t be good company, while I’m working through all of that.”“You don’t have to be packed up and gone today,” he said.“I kind of need to,” I said.He nodded, rubbing his head again.  “I’ll cover the car.  I’ll pay the driver.”“Thank you,” I said.“You know where to find me.  Place is empty, so you can shout from the stairs and I’ll hear you.”“Right,” I said.“I’m going to head to my office.  I’ve got something to do.”I gave him a little salute.Energized by food and coffee, still feeling lightweight, I worked on getting my boxes packed up.  Along the way, I slotted my files and folders into the box I’d reserved for the most pertinent factors.  The villains of the area, the heroes, and the villains turned hero.  The hoods.The day was warming up.  The light from the sun was warm enough to counteract the lower temperature.  By midday, if yesterday was any indication, it would be short-sleeves and shorts weather again.A message popped up on my screen.♦  Private Messages from Glitzglam:Glitzglam: game plan. u situate yourself at my place until you have apartment ur happy with.  u & I raid ur dads place while he at work, get ur stuff.  standard attack formation, I play defense, make sure coast is clear, I support you, u take point and do what u needI fired off my response.  That worked.  I had a couch to sleep on.One thing off of my to-do list.  I liked the progress.  Progress was good.  So long as I moved forward, I could stay aloft.I cleared off the remainder of the bookshelves, stacking the boxes.  I scribbled out my notes on the lid, checking the contents.There was a knock at the door.“Come in,” I said.Gilpatrick.“Time for me to go?” I asked.“Nah,” he said.  “There’s a bit.  I don’t want to force you out the door like that.”“Okay,” I said.  I raised an eyebrow.“I was thinking, over the past twelve hours, if you were my student, I wouldn’t want to let you go with things like this.  Normally I’d contact a guardian.”My heart skipped a beat at that.  No.“But you said last night you had a family thing to do.  I can connect dots.”I nodded.“I made some phone calls,” he said.He stepped out of the doorway.Mrs. Yamada.  Shorter than me, hair tied back in a simple ponytail, wearing a skirt, white top, and jacket, with a simple, short string of pearls at her collarbone.“Oh wow,” she said.  “Look at you.”I didn’t have words, so I just lifted my arms to either side and let them fall.“Is this okay?” Gilpatrick asked.“Yeah,” I said.  I swallowed.  “Yeah.  Just about perfect.”“I’ll leave you to it,” he said.Jessica blinked a few times, before fanning herself.  “I’m a little misty eyed.  Sorry.”I was a little misty eyed myself.“Can I give you a hug?” she asked.  When I nodded, she did so.  I hugged her back.“You put me down as your emergency contact?” she asked.“Sorry,” I said.  “I- I honestly forgot I did that.  It was more than a year ago.”I’d had to name someone, and I hadn’t named my parents because-Because.“It’s more than alright,” she said.  “Your boss said he was worried about you.”I opened my mouth to reply, and then the waterworks started instead.⊙Jessica slammed the back hatch of her car, most of the boxes settled inside.“Do you want to walk?” she asked.  “Around the block, maybe?  Or we could step back inside.”If I was going to start crying again.Students were just now starting to appear, and I didn’t want to sit still.“We can walk,” I said.“It’s been amazing to hear your voice,” she said.  “I know you were often frustrated, trying to communicate with the means you had available.  I was frustrated too, but I wasn’t allowed to say that.”“I could tell,” I said.“You were a challenging patient, those first few months-”I snorted.“-but much like many teachers say they grow to care most about the class clowns and problem students, I came to hold you close to my heart.  I wanted so badly to give you answers and to hear you out without having to rely on text to speech and letters you wrote between appointments.  I wanted to dialogue, and it was so very hard to do that.”“It was,” I said.Why was it so much easier to talk about the things that I couldn’t normally even think about, like this?“How did you find your way back from that?”How did I become Victoria again, instead of the wretched thing in the hospital room, or in the home for invalids?“My sister,” I said, my voice soft.“Oh.  That’s not an easy thing,” she said.“No,” I said, my voice even softer.I’d already filled her in on the details of yesterday and the past few months.  She’d offered a listening ear.  I’d spent all night working out my next few steps, I knew what the situation was, I didn’t really need more angles to view it from.This, though… if I was going to make the most of the time I had with her here, then I wanted to at least get a handle on this.“We were all brought to the battlefield during Gold Morning.  There’s… that’s a hard topic to field.”“There’s an unspoken agreement that the civilians don’t get to know,” she said.“But you’re not really a civilian,” I said.“No,” she said.  “I’ve heard reports.  Some from very close to the center of the action.  I know what happened.”“Body, mind, and heart, you know how that’s a thing?” I asked.“Yes.”“I lost my body, two years before Gold Morning.  My heart was… twisted into something unrecognizable.”“Yes.”“And… Gold Morning hit.  And the-” I paused.  There were people on the street, walking toward the school gate and the various block buildings as we walked away from it all.  A tide we walked against.  I had to shut up until people were mostly out of earshot.  “And I was controlled in mind.  I didn’t have much, but I could make my decisions.  I could decide to use my power or not.  She took that away from me, for a brief time.”“I’ve talked to a number of people who had a very hard time with that.”“You know who she was?”“I do.”I nodded to myself.“Yeah,” I said.  “My sister told me.”Even if I was free to talk, the words still carried their ugly weight.  The words and associated mental pictures still dragged my mood down.“She knew me or knew of me, or she knew my sister.  She decided in the end that she’d put my sister right next to me.  She didn’t do that for many people at all, as far as I can tell.”“And your sister healed you?”“Gave me a body again.  Um.  She made me seventeen again.  Walked back the clock, as if it… I don’t know.  So she didn’t take two years of my life from me in body, like she did in everything else.  I’m physically nineteen now, apparently.”“You said body, mind and spirit.  She fixed one of the three.  Did she undo the effect on your emotions?”I drew in a breath, sighed heavily.  I nodded.  “She actually- she turned off my emotions.  Suppressed them.  Then she asked me what I wanted.”“What did you want?”“I remember thinking, you know, it was really possible she wanted me to say that I wanted to go back to liking her.  And if she did think that, then it was unconscionable.  Divorced from all emotion, I thought it was unconscionable.”“Okay.”“And divorced from all emotion, I thought I’d be fair.  That I’d give her the benefit of a doubt.  That I’d assume that wasn’t what she meant or wanted.  I told her I wanted to remember.”“To remember?”“Those two years,” I said, my voice hollow.  I drew in another deep breath.Further down the street, a nine or ten year old boy with straight black hair and brown skin looked at Jessica, his eyes widening, then he looked at me.  He raised his hand, extending it toward Jessica as they passed one another.She gave him a high five, then pushed his head, sending him on his way, toward the school.“They weren’t good years.”“Rationally?  Divorced from emotion?  I knew.  I can’t forgive her.  Ever.  I can’t forget what she did, or she might do it again.  To someone else.  To me.  I told her to fix my feelings and leave my brain alone otherwise.”“It’s a heavy weight to carry,” she said.“Those two years are really damn heavy,” I said.  “Everything else is.  But I’ve been holding on to that moment.  I hate that I hold onto it, because she did it, but everything is tainted by her, so what can I do?”“You hold onto it?  How?”“Being emotionless, putting those feelings away.  My feelings and impulses got me into that whole mess in the first place.  I hurt an awful lot of awful people, you know.”“We’ve talked about that.  You wrote letters outlining your thoughts and how you wanted to apologize to some of those affected.”“My entire life leading up to that basketball game, I wanted so horribly badly to be a hero, you know?  It felt like I thought about it every ten minutes.  My parents were heroes, my cousin was, my aunt and uncle were, and everything revolved around it.  I wanted it all so badly it hurt, and I didn’t have it for years.  Then that basketball game, and I wanted to have something where I was the hero, where I got to stand out.  Because sometimes it felt like my parents didn’t see me.”“That’s been a recurring idea.  You talked about their missed visits.”“They came a lot,” I said.  “I know that.  My dad more than my mom.  But every missed visit was a horrible thing, and the little things mattered so much when I had nothing else.  Um.  And this basketball game, I know I’ve talked about this before.  But this one girl kicked my freaking ass.  In my face, knocking me over, intercepting every pass, blocking every shot.  She didn’t have any powers or anything, she was just… good.  Better.”“A lot of things came into focus in that moment.”“Every time she or one of her teammates beat me, I could see the look of disappointment on my parent’s faces.  In the other moments, they looked so bored.  And it was boring, you know.  No parent wants to go sit through amateurs doing badly at a high school sport.”“Some do.”“Anyway, she hit me hard, she said something about me being overrated, and it was the last straw.  Realizing I stood so far from family, that I didn’t want to be there, but I had no other choice, my sternum was hurting where she’d driven her elbow into me.  I got my powers.”“Years of wanting, leading up to that.”She’d caught the thread I’d wanted to lay out.  It helped.  “And then just under three years as Victoria-slash-Glory-Girl.  And then… hospital.”“Which was undeniably horrible.”“It felt like my life had ended.  No hope or help.  All I had to cling to were those memories of the three years I was Glory Girl.  I could look back, think about every fight, every encounter.  The ones I was proud of.  The ones I wasn’t.  I had so much regret, replaying events out in my head.  It started with me thinking about- that moment when it all went so wrong.  When she messed with my emotions, then going backward.”Emotions caught me.  I made my expression a scowl, because I was worried what my face might do otherwise.“I was such a stupid fucking kid,” I said.“That’s allowed,” she said.I shook my head.  “Not when you’re as strong as I am.”“And you want to be emotionless?  I don’t know if that’s healthy.”“Not emotionless.  But… smarter about it.  The idea I keep coming back to is I want to be a warrior monk.”“A warrior monk?”“Just- centered when it counts, I guess?”“Why the warrior part?  Do you envision yourself fighting?”“I don’t honestly know.  It never occurred to me.”Jessica smiled.“What’s next for Victoria Dallon?” she asked.“You need to mock me, say Victoria Dallon, warrior monk,” I said.  “I deserve it.”“I wouldn’t,” she said.  “If everyone in costume could remain centered while doing what they do, it would make a world of difference.  I think it’s good.  I’d think about that more as you take your next steps.”“I know I want to move forward, because… I dunno.  I feel like I’m a shark that drowns if it stops moving, or a bird that drops out of the air like a stone if I’m not flying forward.  I know I need to get some of the basics of life squared away.  I’m okay for money for a couple of months, but I can’t stay on Crystal’s couch.”“In my brief interactions with Crystal, I did like her,” Jessica said.“She’s great.  But not great to live with long-term, I don’t think.  You’d never know it to look at her, she’s beautiful, she’s fashionable, and very well put together, but if you looked at her apartment…”I trailed off, using my expression to convey a bit of the horror to Jessica.“Ah,” Jessica said.  She smiled again.“I don’t know what to do next.”“Well, I’d think about how to apply the warrior monk role to your day to day life,” she said.  She pulled off her jacket.  The weather had warmed up enough.  “What it means to you, why it’s the first thing or the recurring thing in your thought processes.”“I just want to… do.”“You said you regretted yesterday, but Jasper thanked you.  Would you rather have not done it?  Is it the ‘want’ in wanting to do things that’s problematic, or is it the ‘do’?”I drew in a deep breath.  “That’s… a very complicated question, I think.”“You don’t have to answer it right now,” she said.“I think I can, though.  I think… I had to.  And as much as it was hard and cost me my job, I preferred it to the alternative.  I can’t not do things that help out.  I just want to do it in a good, centered way.”“Could it be a mundane job?  Construction?  Desk work?  Would you want to do something like you were doing with the patrol?”I thought about it.I couldn’t see it.  Not long-term.“What’s the first thing that comes to mind?” she asked.“I think… fuck me, I think even now, I can’t quite see myself being anything but a hero.  There are good people I’ve gotten to know.  People I want to protect and help.  Like Gilpatrick, like Weld and Vista and my cousin and a couple of the teenagers I was working with in patrol block.  You.  I want good things for them.”“Thank you,” she said.  “That means a lot to me.”“I’ve been trying to convince myself there’s some other way, but… I can’t not do anything.”“There’s worse things.  Especially if you can do it smart and centered.”“I don’t want to be Glory Girl,” I said.  “Someone remarked yesterday that they’d thought she died and… good.  She can stay dead.”“Sounds like you have an idea of what you’re doing next.”“It’s the wrong climate for it,” I said.  “I just watched a team of heroes get eaten alive by the public.  One took a bullet.”“Figure it out,” she said.I frowned.“Again, there’s no rush,” she said.“I can’t sit still,” I said.  “There’s a bit of a rush.”“Touch base with me,” she said.  “We’ll go out for coffee, catch up.  I can offer unofficial, more-friend-than-therapist advice.  I think you’ll figure it out, and I can give you a few nudges here and there.”That gave me pause.“You’re not a therapist anymore?” I asked.“Just the opposite,” she said.  “I’m very much a therapist.  Ten hour days, six or seven days a week, and other peripheral obligations.  I’m afraid I’m not in a position to take you on as a patient again, Victoria, as much as I would dearly like to.”That hurt.  I didn’t want to say it, but it did hurt.“I just joined the Wardens as a staff psychologist for their junior members and some special cases, and I’m just not equipped, unfortunately.  If you want it, I could try finding a colleague who you could talk to.  Most are as busy as I am, so it might take a bit of time.”I want you.I want-“Sorry to take up your time today, when you’re as busy as you are.”“It’s more than alright, Victoria,” she said.  She was looking straight ahead as she talked, one hand on her jacket as she walked.  “With the hours I work, I lose objectivity.  It becomes the work, and I lose sight of the patients.  Sometimes it’s hard to see the wins.  Like I said, you were a patient close to my own heart, and I thought you were one of the ones we lost.  Seeing you, hearing you?  It means the world to me.  It gives me a measure of hope.”I nodded.She looked over at me.  “I’ll reach out to a colleague.  I’ll see what I can do, if that’s okay.  Give you some reassurance there.”“I-” I started.“Yes?”“It’s okay, but… if you wanted to reassure me-” I said.It felt a little less like I could talk about certain topics with her, now.“If it’s within my power, I’ll try anything,” she said.“My sister,” I said, my voice soft.  “Send someone her way.”Mrs. Yamada raised one eyebrow.I knew what she was thinking.  She wondered if it was selflessness, or if I was a surprisingly good person.  I wasn’t.“She’s the scariest damn person in the world, Jessica,” I said.  “And I don’t think that’s bias.  There’s a chance she’s going to do something bad, and she’s so damn powerful, that when and if it happens, it’s going to be so much worse than what happened to me, and it’s going to affect an awful lot more people.”                                                                                             Daybreak – Interlude 1                                                                                             The truck stopped at the gate, producing the occasional sputter and knocking sound as it sat there.  The driver extended a hand out the window, waving for the camera, and the gate opened by way of remotely operated pulley.It was another minute to the top of the hill, where the truck rolled to a stop in the parking lot, an expanse of gravel without any defined parking spots.  The three people within remained where they were, warily observing the restaurant from a distance.It was a log cabin writ large, the cedars stripped of their bark and stained with something that made them almost glossy, a warm yellow under the sun.  The third floor was half the size of the other two, allowing the other half of what would have been the third floor to be a rooftop patio instead.  A series of tables was scattered around the building, some close together and others a considerable distance away, as if they were trying to escape into the woods.  Beyond the building was a cliff, and a vast expanse of forests, hills, mountains, and a small lake.“Nice view,” Moose said, from the backseat.Linc was settled in the passenger seat, reclining a bit with his seat angled back and his legs folded under him.  With Moose in the back, he’d had to slide his seat as far forward as it could go, and it didn’t leave him much legroom.  “Just think, past that view there isn’t nothing at all.  If you headed straight ahead and kept going, you might not find any habitation until you ended up on the backside of this settlement here.”“If you headed straight ahead,” the driver said, pausing to take a swig of the bottle of water she’d wedged into her cup holder, making a face at how warm it was, “You’d put yourself into that lake down there.  Or you’d end up in the ocean.  You’d drown either way.”Linc smirked.“People would call you an idiot,” she said.  “Why would you go straight ahead like that?  Are you proving a point?”“I don’t think that’s what Linc was getting at,” Moose said.“Harper knows what I’m getting at,” Linc said, turning around in his seat to look at Moose as he said it.Moose was a big guy, with tousled blond hair.  He’d undone some of the straps of his mask and had the mask laying over one muscular shoulder.  The mask was metal, crude, and Moose wore something cloth under it for padding, which he had on now.  He wore a sleeveless undershirt, jeans, boots, and had two gauntlets sitting next to him on the car seat.  Even with the truck being large and Moose lying down across the length of the seat, he barely fit.  He didn’t seem to mind much.Behind Moose and the truck was the gravel road that led up the hill, the gate checkpoint, and a ways below that, the simple settlement where most visitors would be made to feel unwelcome.  One to two thousand people would be living there at most.“They built this place and situated it on the very edge of civilization,” Linc said, to round off his earlier thought.“You two always seemed like the kind of edge of civilization people to me,” Moose asked.“We do okay,” Linc said.  “Put us in the middle of a city, we do fine, eh babe?”“Mm,” Harper made a vaguely affirmative sound.  “This a trap, y’think?”Linc turned his attention to the building at the top of the hill.  “Nah.  Why would you build a nice place like this and use it for a nefarious purpose.”“Well, y’know, it’s gonna be nefarious.  That’s why we’re here,” she said.  “It’s a question of if it’s a murderous sort of nefarious.”“That’s a good question, I admit,” Linc said.“I knew a guy,” Moose said.  “He had a mansion.  Inherited or somethin’.  Super nice.”“The guy or the house?” Linc asked.“Hm?”“The guy was nice or the house was nice?”“The house.  That’s what I’m gettin’ at.  The guy was as nefarious as they get.  He renovated the insides.  He wanted to make a whole business of holdin’ people that needed holdin’.  For ransom.  Said he’d deal with ’em and clean up the mess if ransoms weren’t paid.  Wanted to be a contractor for disposin’ of people in horrible ways.”“You’re supposed to just drop them off at the nice, conspicuous mansion, hand over cash?” Harper asked.“That was it, I think.  He’d make sure they died slow and horrible for you, clean them up, make sure they weren’t found.”“Definitely not a nice guy then,” Linc said.“I dare say he wasn’t,” Moose said.“That’s a terrible idea for a business,” Harper said.“It kind of is,” Linc said.“Might’ve been,” Moose said.  “He didn’t seem in it for the money, gotta say.  I highly suspect he was more focused on the part where he would do horrible things to people.  Guy has a nice place, he wants to do creatively bad things to people, and he wanted a bit of pocket money.  Draw lines between each of those things and you end up with something shaped like his game plan there.”“A triangle?” Linc asked, looking back at Moose.  At Moose’s shrug, he elaborated, “If you draw straight lines between three things, you get a triangle.”“Maybe the lines weren’t straight,” Moose said.  “But if you’re wondering if this is a trap, I don’t think it being fancy is ruling anythin’ out.”“It’s a log building, Moose.  Nothing that fancy.”“Fancy to me.”Harper leaned forward against the steering wheel, to get closer to the windshield, squinting against the sun.“What do you think, babe?” Linc asked.  “Is it a murderous nefarious or a prosperous nefarious.”“It’s something,” she said.  “The people on the roof are in costume and some of them are looking at us.  I think we better get ourselves inside or they’re going to start laughing at us.”“They’re going to laugh whatever happens,” Linc said.  “Your truck has seen better days-”“Don’t go talking about my truck, Linc.”“And we’ve got Moose with us, no offense Moose.”“Some offense taken, thank you very much,” Moose said, indignant.“You call yourself Moose.  People are going to laugh.  That’s when you show your merits and make them stop laughing, is the way it works.”“People shouldn’t laugh in the first place,” Moose said.  “The Moose is a terrifying and noble creature.  If you wouldn’t fuck with a rhino, you shouldn’t fuck with a moose.  It’s one of the only proper prehistoric, giant animal species to have the grit to last to today.”Harper turned off the truck.  The truck sputtered, coughed, and died abruptly, in a way that suggested it wouldn’t revive again.“I know, bud,” Linc said, taking his eye off the truck’s much-abused, dust-caked dash.  “I know that much, I’ve seen one up close.  I’ve seen one run through snow that a normal person couldn’t walk in and hit a car hard enough to roll it.  I have a healthy respect.”“Damn right,” Moose said.Harper gave Linc a look, pulling her full mask on and flipping up her hood.“But they don’t all know it,” Linc said.  “You gotta work with that.  You picked a jokey name, you gotta put up with the jokes.”“Hope was they’d be laughing with, not laughing at,” Moose said.  “At least I’d hope you weren’t the ones poking fun at me.  It’s unkind, Linc.”Harper climbed out of the truck.“I’m not laughing at, bud.  I’m just saying they might be.  That’s all,” Linc said.  He pulled his mask on, fixed his hair and beard with few sweeps of his hand, and climbed out, then hit the lever to flip his seat forward and give Moose room to squeeze out.Moose kept the cloth mask on over his upper face,  leaving the metal mask on his shoulder.  He stretched, his joints popping audibly, and pulled his fur-lined gauntlets on.“You’re going to have to take those off again if we end up eating,” Linc said.“It’s about presentation,” Moose said.  “Besides, the name doesn’t make sense if I don’t got ’em.”Harper was in costume, though the costume part was mostly a hooded, sleeveless top in her namesake velvet color, lopsided in how it trailed down over one leg in a robe-like aesthetic.  She wore skintight shorts underneath.  A black mask covered her upper face, and had truncated, forking horns that poked out through the top of the hood and kept the hood from falling back.Linc wore a mask like Velvet’s, but his traced the area around his eye sockets and eyebrows, with the edges tracing back and into his hair, forking as they did.  He wore a bodysuit for the upper body and pants.  His costume had always been meant to be layered, but the heat had forced him to strip down to the base layer, with the pants only because he felt like a clown if he wore only the skintight stuff.People leaning against and over the railing on the roof watched them as they approached the door.“This place is a hell of a lot better than the last couple we visited,” Prancer remarked.“More expensive too,” Velvet said.  She was looking at the blackboard posted by the door, with prices.  “Twenty dollars for a chicken sandwich?”“Come on,” Prancer said, pushing the door open.The inside was expansive, with the kitchen as an island in the middle, counters and surrounding it, booths around the edges of the room, and tables in the space in between.  There were only eleven non-staff people within, but the ground floor could have seated a hundred or more.Prancer approached the kitchen island.  He spoke to a black, twenty-something woman in a tan polo shirt and apron, “Who do I talk to for the rules?”She jerked a thumb over her shoulder, indicating an elderly black man who was wiping out a glass.  The man was watching, squinting with one eye, as he carried out the routine motion of cleaning the glass.“He’s in charge?” Prancer asked.The employee gave Prancer a single nod.“What can I do for you?” the man asked, as the three approached.“We’ve been around the block a couple of times, I’m just looking for a primer on customs, and any special rules.”“Payment up front for what you’re ordering, have the money ready when you order if it’s busy.  Don’t cause trouble, don’t draw weapons, don’t be loud, give us a heads up and use the side door or the patio if your power is going to bother anyone.  Upstairs is the bar, you don’t go upstairs unless you’re invited or you already know you qualify to go upstairs.”“What kind of qualification?” Velvet asked.“If you have to ask, you don’t have it,” the old man said.  He put the glass down and picked up another.  “Roof is for more private meetings than you’d have on the second floor.  Don’t go taking yourself up there if you wouldn’t be allowed on the second floor.”“Noted,” Prancer said.  “Anyone to avoid, watch out for, anything like that?”“That’s more for you to watch out for than for me to bother with.  If they’re causing a problem or being a bother to others, they’ll get kicked out.  If you help with the kicking out, I’ll give you something on the house.”“Right,” Prancer said.  “Got it.”“Do you serve drinks down here?” Moose asked.“We do.  Anything fancier than beer or wine, we’ll have to send someone upstairs to fetch it.”“Could I grab a mightyman?” Moose asked.  He pulled off a gauntlet and retrieved a wallet from his pocket.  He held out a twenty.  “Long, hot drive.”“Name?” the old man asked, gesturing at an employee.  The employee set to getting the beer.  The old man pulled a pad and pen out of his apron.“Name?  Uh, M.K.,” Moose said.“No initials,” the man said.“Just Moose then,” Moose said, sliding the twenty across the bar.  “We can order food at the tables?”“You can,” the old man said.  He picked up the money, then pulled out a fiver from the pocket of his apron and passed it back to Moose.  He looked at the others.  “Names?”“Prancer.  She’s Velvet.”“Do I need to worry about you?”“Nah.  We’re pretty tame.  We’re here to make contacts and get our names out there for the small stuff.”“If you do any business, be discreet enough I and my staff don’t see it.  If you use powers, don’t bother the person next to you.”“Got it.  Can I grab a beer?  What my buddy Moose is having,” Prancer handed over the bills.“Me too,” Velvet said.Prancer withdrew a larger bill from his wallet, and set it on the counter, sliding it toward the old man.  “Gratuity?”“No need,” the old man said.  “Service fees and peace of mind are worked into the food prices.  Order something, if you want to thank me.”Beers in hand, they briefly considered sitting at the counter before Moose took a seat at one of the tables.“Where you sit is important,” Prancer said.  “Booth, you’re minding your own business, you’ve got walls around you.  Sitting at the counter, you’re open to people approaching you and joining you, I think.  Not entirely sure how it works here in particular.”“I hear you,” Moose said, “But I was sittin’ funny the entire drive here, and if I sit on one of those stools then I’m going to have my back spasming the entire way back.  I need a sturdy chair, here.”“Sure, doesn’t matter that much,” Prancer said.  He twisted around in his seat, one hand on his beer, taking a look at the others who were present.  “Pretty laid back here.”“Could be a quieter time of the day,” Velvet said.“Out of the way place, too,” Prancer said.  “You heard what he said about using powers?  How many places have we been to, and how many allowed use of powers at all?”“Ten.  Ten places,” Velvet said, hunkering down over her beer.  “This is the only one, I think.  Might have been a rule in The Well, but that was more the kind of place where you don’t know the rules until someone’s punching your face in for violating them.”Prancer watched as a faint speck of dust traveled across his vision, pink-tinted.  He smiled.Four teenagers in the corner booth.  They wore dark clothes with symbols and designs spray painted on and bleached into the fabric.  One with a bandanna on his head looked their way, and Prancer flashed the guy a smile.Three in another booth, against a wall.  Tinkers.  There was a cloth strewn out over the table, and parts were laid out.  They ranged from twists of metal to a glass tube housing something that looked like a large, chewed wad of gum.  The wad was throwing itself against the sides of its glass cage.He wondered how that worked with the ‘no business’ rule.  Were they only talking shop?  Where was the line drawn?Sitting alone in one booth was a woman with a mask covering her lower face, long black hair, and a long red dress with a slit down one side, exposing a tantalizing bit of leg.  She wore an intricate framework of metal at her arms and hands, a series of bands at the elbow, wrist, knuckles, and rings at the finger, with thin rods of steel extending between each, along the back of each finger, and stopping at each finger and thumbtip.  Each tip was enveloped by an ornate claw.Her heels were much the same, Prancer noted.  Heels were unusual for someone in costume, and hers were more unusual still.   She wore something similar to her gloves, with the same bands at her leg, ankle, and foot, with the thin metal bars extending between each.  Her toes were covered with the same metal claws, there was a strap of metal below the balls of her feet, and at her heel, one large claw-point served as the ‘heel’ of her heel, stabbing straight down.When she moved one leg to fold one knee over the other, the claw tips moved on their own, twitching, recalibrating, the heel shifting back to stay pointed at the ground, flick back and away, then flick down.She undid one side of her mask so it swung toward Prancer, still blocking his view of her mouth, helped by the draping of long hair, and she leaned down, taking a bite of her wrap.  She put one hand to the loose end of her mask while she chewed, and fastened the end as she swallowed.She saw him looking, turning her head his way.  He smiled at her.She only stared.“Someone’s coming,” Moose said.One of the spray painted kids.  The guy Prancer had smiled at.“You’re new.”“Prancer, Velvet, M.K.,” Prancer introduced the group.“Where are you from?”“Alaska, believe it or not.”“Long way,” the teenager said.“Especially when you’re driving it,” Prancer said.  “Who are you guys?”“The group’s Ripcord.  I’m Gorgos.  We raid stores and resell, mostly.  We’re nobodies.  It’s the B-listers and small fry down here.  The people with name recognition go upstairs.”“Meaning the people we want to do business with are upstairs,” Velvet said, still leaning heavily over her beer.“It’s fine,” Prancer said.  “We’ll work it out.”“What do you guys do?”“We wheel and deal,” Prancer said.“Prancer likes to be clever, but he doesn’t get that sometimes you have to explain why it’s clever, otherwise you only confuse people,” Velvet said.“It’s why I have you, babe.”“The wheel part is getaway driving and transporting,” she explained.The kid leaned forward.  The decoration on his outfit looked like the sort done with a stencil and a spray bottle filled with bleach, strategically bleaching fabric.  Snakes and a woman’s face as a recurring motif.  He had a bandanna over the top of his head and one over his nose and mouth.  “What do you deal?”“Grass, mostly,” Prancer said.“You actually have some?”“Not here, but we have it.  Brand new and in high demand, given the times,” Prancer said.“Are you looking for resellers?”“For the right price.  Mostly we’re looking for new friends, and we’re trying to get the lay of the land before we do anything too enterprising.”“Can I get back to you?” the guy asked.“You’re welcome to,” Prancer said.  “We wouldn’t mind company either, if you guys wanted to join us.”“I’d have to get back to you on that too,” the guy said.  “We’re trying to find our way these days.  We agreed in the beginning we wouldn’t have one leader, and that was great then, but right now we’ve got two different leadership styles butting heads.”Prancer looked over at the table, where those seated were having a very fierce, hushed discussion.“If you want to just sit and trade stories, we’d be happy to have you,” Prancer said.  “Get away from all that, maybe come away with some fresh perspective.”“I might take you up on that.  For now I’d better get back and make sure nobody reaches across the table to strangle someone.”“Question before you go,” Moose said.  “Is it always this quiet?”“It’s about to get noisier,” Gorgos said.  “Keep an eye on the guy at the end of the kitchen there.  He communicates with people in town.  He was talking to the boss about something and the boss put another cook on the stove.  Wait ten minutes and I bet he’ll hit the button to open the gate.  If he holds it down it’s a lot of people.  My guess is the ferry from NYC hit the shore near the G-N portal twenty minutes ago.”“Good to know, thanks,” Prancer said.Gorgos jogged back to his team.“You’re dwellin’ a lot on going upstairs,” Moose observed.“Reminds me of being a kid and being told I had to stay downstairs with my cousins and their friends during the holidays.  My cousins were assholes,” Velvet said.  “One good thing about Gold Morning is it took them out of the picture.”Moose whistled.“She’s wearing the purple cloak, that’s a sign of royalty, don’t you know?” Prancer plucked at Velvet’s hood.  Velvet batted his hand away.  “And royalty doesn’t not go upstairs.  Royalty doesn’t show mercy.”“Y’know I went to prison because of you, Prance,” she said, quiet.“Well, yeah.  I will point out we survived Gold Morning because we weren’t home when Alaska got hit.”“I went to prison for you,” she said, again.  “That counts for a lot.”“‘Course.  How does that connect, though?”“Just sayin’,” she said, her accent thicker as her voice became softer.  “You said things would be different.”“They will,” he said.  He put a hand around her shoulders and pulled her closer, then kissed the top of her head.  “We’ve got a decent crop, a lot of demand.  We’ll do okay.  We’ll make inroads.”“I’m optimistic,” Moose said.“I’m not unoptimistic,” Velvet said.“You’re not enthused either, doesn’t sound like,” Moose said.“Just sorta hoping for more, sooner,” she said.“Yeah,” he said.  There wasn’t much more to say.Velvet reached out, and the menu flew from the tabletop to her hand.  It was tinted red and dusty, but much of their table and glasses were, now.Prancer took stock of the other three capes in the room before the newest batch of arrivals reached the front door.There was one, who might have been a bouncer, who had stepped out the side door momentarily and was now taking a seat by that same door.  He wore a mask of metal bars that looked like they’d been welded to one another, all vertical, but he also wore a black apron.That left only the couple at the bar.  Matching costumes, white armor with jet black iconography, multiple circles and crescents in various patterns, with the armor sprayed black around each icon, so it looked like the darkness glowed.  The man wore full armor, the woman wore only scattered pieces of armor, with white chainmail to cover the rest of her.They drank white wine, in the middle of the afternoon.Capes were strange people, Prancer mused.“I want to be the kind of person who earns her way upstairs,” Velvet said.  Her head still rested against his shoulder, where he’d pulled her close.“That’s really stuck in you, huh?”“It’s stuck,” she said.  Without moving her head, she raised the beer to her lips and took a careful sip.“You might have to lose the beater of a truck, babe, if you want to dress the part.”“Don’t go talkin’ about my truck, Prance.”“Every time you turn it off, it sounds like it’s off for good.  I say a little prayer to myself that it will be, even knowing it’s a long, long walk back to home.  Then I can take the money I’ve got saved up and buy you something nice.  All the bells and whistles.”“When I got out of prison, I only had two things, babe.  That truck, and you.  I wasn’t feeling especially fond of you at the time, either.  It’s the only thing I’ve had for myself since I was old enough to have anything, that I’ve been able to keep.”“Counts for somethin’, that,” Moose said.“It does,” Velvet said, frowning down at her beer.Prancer frowned at Moose, who only shrugged.  Guy wasn’t making it any easier.“What if we overhauled the outside, got someone to give the engine a real solid lookin’-at?” Prancer asked.“So long as it stays my truck.  I don’t want you ship-of-Theseusing it.”Prancer resisted swearing under his breath.  So that tactic wouldn’t work.There was more of the pink dust in the air, now.  He gave Velvet a kiss on top of the head, then shrugged slightly.  She moved her head off of his shoulder, sitting upright.“Things will be better,” he said.She reached for his hand and squeezed it.  “I’m going to go find the ladies’ room.  Order food before things get hairy.  I’ll have the chicken caesar sandwich and grab a few bottled waters while you’re at it.  For the drive back.”“You know the markup on those will be insane,” Prancer said.“Just get me my water,” she said.She walked away.  Prancer watched her walk away, feeling wistful.He signaled the waitress.  He made sure to give Velvet’s order while he remembered it, and then gave his own.  Moose put in enough of an order for two people.When they were alone again, Moose commented, “Sorry, for interjectin’.”“Interjecting?”“When you were talking about the truck, and about prison.”“Ah.  Yep.  Apology accepted.”“Hard to be the third wheel sometimes.  Especially when things get complicated, relationship-wise.”“Can’t speak about the third-wheeling.  That’s for you to figure out.  But for the relationship part, it’s the simplest thing in the world, Moose,” Prancer said.  “She’s my girlfriend, I’m her boyfriend.  Sometimes you and she enjoy each other’s company, sometimes I enjoy someone else’s company, but that doesn’t change that it’s me and it’s her as the boyfriend and girlfriend.”His voice had become progressively more stern as he’d talked.  He paused, meeting Moose’s eyes.“Makes sense,” Moose said.  Prancer smiled.“Doesn’t seem like you’ve had anyone but her keeping you company, gotta say,” Moose said.Prancer looked at the woman with the mask on her lower face and the claw-heels.  “Trying to be better.”“Good for you,” Moose said, before taking a drink of his beer.“I’m going to marry that Velvet sometime soon,” Prancer said.  “I’ve just got to make amends for old wrongs first.  Can’t ask her to marry me when the last momentous event in our lives was me being a screwup.”“The prison thing?”“Everything before, too.  Trying to be better.”“I don’t want to step on any toes or get into anythin’ too sensitive here,” Moose said.  “But can I ask?  Would be easier to not step on toes if I can ask.”“It’s the whole thing.  Get powers as a kid, sixteen years old, make friends with the right people, start dealing.  It’s an elevation in status, y’know?  I was the guy who the cool kids in high school went to for product.  Had money, had girls throwing themselves at me, I was invited to all the parties, and I meet Velvet there.  One of many girls in one of many cities.  But she gets powers and comes back to me, wants in, wants out of her house, especially.  I oblige, and she doesn’t make me regret it.”Moose nodded.“Years pass, we find our fit.  She’s got more financial sense, I’ve got the salesmanship.  Most capes, there’s going to be conflict.  She’s got her thing, you know how her power works.  She hangs around somewhere, and this dust collects, and she can telekinetically control stuff, more dust there is on it.  It’s how she gets that fucking truck going again, when it refuses to move.  She makes us sit there for five minutes and then gives it another try, and it works, and she’ll fiddle with it later and get it tuned up just enough it starts going.”“She must care an awful lot about it,” Moose observed.“She does.  But that’s her whole psychology.  She wants to settle in, wants to have a place she can call hers, whether it’s that truck cab or, I don’t know, going upstairs.  I get restless.  The mover thing.  That causes friction.  But we work despite it.  We’re as soulmate as you can get when you’ve got… whatever these things are giving us our powers.  Parasites.  You had the visions when we were on the battlefield, that day.”“Sure,” Moose said.“As yin-yang soulmate as you can get with these things screwing up the fit,” Prancer said.  “But we got comfortable.  I graduate school, barely, she graduates a year after me, we keep up the routine.  Some wheeling, mostly dealing.  The parties every weekend, tooth and nail fights because we’re both the type to flirt with others, before we realized we were fine just not worrying about it.  Couple more years pass, I’m twenty-one, she’s twenty, still in the routine.”“A rut?” Moose asked.“Just the way things were.  Somewhere along the line, you know, I’m twenty-seven, she’s twenty-six, and I’m still boning boys and girls from high school.  Still partying.”Moose’s eyes had widened.“Legal, mind you,” Prancer said.  “But… sketchy, in retrospect.”“More than a little, no offense,” Moose said.“None taken.  I deserve it.  I didn’t realize until they came after us.  Capes, police.  You get into a groove and you don’t think about things and somehow a decade gets away from you.  You’re not the cool guy people are excited to get to know.  You’re the guy they’re into because they have to be if they want a discount, or if they want someone accessible that’s older.  Sad.  Pathetic.  Slapped me in the face while people were talking to and about me in court.  Forced me to take a long, hard look at who I was and who I wanted to be.”“That’s good,” Moose said.A young woman entered the restaurant.  Prancer almost thought it was the first of the influx, but she was alone.  She was an older teenager or twenty-something, with long white hair, wearing a black dress and black makeup, and she took a seat alone at the table.  She rummaged in a bag to find a book.The waitress approached her, kettle already in hand.  The money was passed across the table, and the tea was poured.  A regular.Her mask was so simple it might as well have not been there.  Curious, too, that she’d come this far to read a book.  Maybe someone would be joining her.Prancer watched the new arrival, but he kept talking, “She told me, over and over again, I needed to be better.  That she wanted better.  That we needed to be careful.  I didn’t listen.  We got out of prison, she took me back, and I owe her for that.”“If your critical flaw was not listening, might be you’ve gotta listen when she’s saying she loves that vehicle out there.”Prancer nodded slowly.  Then he let his head loll back, and he groaned.  “I’ve put up with that thing for so many damn years.”Velvet’s glass of beer slid across the table, and Prancer caught it just before it could reach the edge of the table and tip into his lap.“You’re talking about my truck?” Velvet asked, making her way back from the restroom.“Moose is telling me to let it go,” Prancer said.  “I’m trying to come to terms with the idea.”“You’re a good boy, Moose,” Velvet said, taking her seat.  The glass pulled out of Prancer’s hands, sliding across the table to slap into Velvet’s hand.“Appreciate that, Velvet.”“Did you order or did you forget?” she asked.“Remembered,” Prancer said.  “It’s coming soon.”The front door opened.A large collection of capes entered and immediately headed off to find their booths and tables.  One of the new arrivals stepped inside and loitered by the door.  She was a woman with a slender figure and a bag over her head, for lack of a better description.  The bag was cloth, with a pink animal pattern on it.  The rest of her form-fitting outfit matched, including the shawl she wore.Prancer leaned in the direction of the door, putting his mouth near Velvet’s ear.  “I see Nursery.  I wonder if Blindside is around.”“I hope the kid’s okay,” Velvet said.  She looked at Moose.  “Were you there when we talked to ’em?”“I was.”“They were up to something.”“I remember.”A man in armor was one of the last to arrive.  The armor was white, and looked like it was fashioned of strips, woven and wound around him, the ends left frayed and sticking out to the sides and behind him.  There was no face to it.  Only a Y-shaped set of ridges.  He stood between Nursery, a man in a black outfit and heavy hood, and a heavyset man with long hair, a dense beard, and a mechanical arm that extended to the ground.At his arrival, people across the room started applauding, from Ripcord to the people at the counter, to the white haired girl and the woman with the mask.  Even the kitchen staff.  The man in armor laughed, the sound mingling with the general applause.Moose joined in, and Velvet and Prancer offered their own light, confused applause.“Thank you.  Thank you.  Is Marquis here?” the man in armor asked.The old man at the kitchen pointed skyward.  “Roof.”The man in armor saluted, then ducked back through the door.Velvet raised her hand to get Nursery’s attention.  The woman’s group was already splitting up.  The man in black joined the people in white armor.  The bearded man with the mechanical arm walked over to the woman with the claws, sitting in her booth.Nursery approached the table.“Good to see you,” Prancer said.“I didn’t think I would see you three all the way out here,” Nursery said.“We’re trying to see who’s out there.  The other places have been a little seedy.”“They are.  Seedy can be fun, though,” Nursery said.  “Reminds me of the old days.”“You keep updating your costume,” Velvet said.“Silly thing, isn’t it?  It’s easier to make a new one than to wash the blood and slime out.  I feel ridiculous.”“What was happening with the applause?” Prancer asked.“Mission success,” Nursery said.  “In a roundabout, unexpected way, but that’s often how these things go.”“Congratulations,” Moose said.“Thank you, Moose.  It was a thing.  We took a week to figure out what we were doing, we had to check with a few people, a number of thinkers, make sure we weren’t stepping on toes.  The peace being what it is, we didn’t want to cause too much trouble.”“Was it a big mission?” Prancer asked.“Big,” Nursery said.  “Plenty of room for things to go very wrong, with some bad repercussions that could be felt by everyone.”Prancer’s eyebrows went up.“But we were careful, we had the right people-”“You included among those people,” Velvet said.“Yes,” Nursery said, clasping her hands together.“What was the job?” Prancer asked.“To kidnap someone, and have her disappear for long enough that people would get upset about it.”“Huh,” Prancer said.“They’re anxious out there.  They feel powerless.  The idea was to pick someone controversial, and take them out of the picture.  Make them the topic of debate.  Is vigilante justice right or wrong?  In this case, where the wrong isn’t so terribly wrong?  Well, that was their idea.  I do think she did something horrible.  It’s why I agreed to the job.”“What was that?”“Hurt a woman and made her miscarry.  They say it was a mistake.”“I can see where that hits close to home.”“Sorry to hear,” Moose said.“Thank you.  You’re kind.  The plan was to provoke the debate and raise the issue before things reached a more critical point.  Venting off the steam before things exploded.  The debate seems to be trending that way.”“Sounds like it needed a fine hand,” Velvet said.  “That’s some good work.”“I didn’t do it alone,” Nursery said.“Your first time working with the others?”“It was.  Lord of Loss is sweet, good at what he does.”“He went straight to the roof, I’m guessing that means he isn’t the type to work with B-listers like us.”“No, I suppose not.  He doesn’t like being indoors.  You’re recruiting?  That’s what you’re asking after?”“Or looking for a spot of work,” Prancer said.“Snag, sitting over there, is looking to hire people for a project down the road.  He wants to do test runs first, make sure he succeeds on the first try.  Those two hired the same information broker we worked with for that job.”“You had an information broker?”“She was ops too.  Talked to us on the earpieces.  A little shaky on some things, surprisingly quick on others.  But I think you run into that with any thinker.”Prancer nodded.“Snag is a few months new, a rookie, with a rookie’s mindset, but he has good instincts.  If I can say this in confidence…”“Of course,” Velvet said.“…I wouldn’t want to be on a team with him long-term,” Nursery said.  “He’s mean.  Unkind, impatient.  Emotional.  You get that with a lot of the new ones.  Too close to whatever set them off.”Prancer nodded slowly.  “Old ones have their own problems.  Ruts and routines.”“They do.  Um, I should hurry.  Blindside has a mouth but I do like them.  They do a decent job, if you can work around the limitations.  They’re outside now, sitting on the patio by the side door.  Can’t come inside without turning a few heads.”Prancer smiled at the bad joke.“Kingdom Come likes his bible verses, I earned some considerable brownie points by knowing the names and numbers to go with most of them.  Benefit of bible school until I was eighteen.  He’s a consummate professional.  Very gentle, very efficient.”“Expensive?” Velvet asked.“Not too bad, I don’t think.  I don’t know what he was paid, but if it’s close to my own wage, it shouldn’t be horrendous.  He’s very selective about the jobs he’ll accept.”“What about you?” Prancer asked.“Me?  I’m boring.  I’m not even a parahuman, not really.”“Wait, what?” Moose asked.“I’m not,” Nursery said.  She had a light tone of voice, like she was smiling from the other side of the cloth mask.  “It’s why I feel so out of place in costume.”Prancer watched as others came through the door.  He recognized Biter but failed to get Biter’s attention with a wave.“How does that work?” Moose asked.“Show him the bump,” Velvet said, smiling.“The bump?” Moose asked.  “Oh.”Prancer glanced over at Nursery, who was holding her cloth costume tighter against her stomach, showing her slightly protruding belly.“They’re the parahuman,” Nursery said.  “I’m the ride.”“Oh,” Moose said.  “Oh wow.  Sorry.”“No need to be sorry.  It’s a bond unlike any other,” Nursery said.  She gave Moose a pat on the cheek.  “It’s hard sometimes, but I owe it to them.  Making up for mistakes I’ve made.”“Yeah,” Prancer said, staring at his beer.  He looked from his glass to Nursery.  “Don’t be too hard on yourself, hm?”“I’ll try,” she said.  “I should go.  Take care and wish me luck.”“Good luck,” Moose said.  He still looked shell-shocked.“What’s next?” Velvet asked, smiling.“What we did yesterday is only one instance.  They’ll have to do it again when the pressure builds.  Sooner or later, however many thinkers they work with, however good the people they hire, there will be a mistake.  Something will happen, it could be too much, too little, and then everything goes to hell in a handbasket.”“Heavy,” Prancer said.“But I’ve stayed too long.  My baby and I earned ourselves an invite upstairs, because they might hire me again, and because we showed our stuff, I don’t want the offer to expire,” Nursery said, excited.  “We can’t drink at the bar, but it’s still a chance to meet some of the people running the corner worlds, the major players.  A huge opportunity.”“That’s amazing,” Moose said, looking down at the bump.  “Congratulations.  Both of you.”“You’re so sweet.  I should go, excuse me,” Nursery said, leaving.“We’ll talk again,” Prancer said.Velvet raised a hand, her smile frozen on her face.  Prancer reached over to squeeze her thigh.“I think I hate her now,” Velvet said.He gave her leg another squeeze.His thoughts turned over as he watched the people enter.  Some headed upstairs.  Ones with nice costumes, scary ones.  He recognized quite a few.There were also the others.  The B-listers, the dregs, the people who weren’t yet established, filling up the ground floor, ordering their food and drinks.“Hey Moose,” he said.Moose stared off into space, in the direction of the stairs.“Moose,” Velvet said.  “I’m pretty sure she’s a loon.  I wouldn’t worry too much about it.”“Moose,” Prancer tried again.Moose frowned, glancing back at the stairs.  “Yeah?”“Look at the room.  Tell me, who do you know here?”“Some of the big guys.  Biter, you and I had drinks with him.  Etna, Crested, Beast of Burden, Bitter Pill, Nailbiter, Hookline, Kitchen Sink.”“Do me a favor?”“Sure.”“Round ’em up.  Anyone you get along with, who you think wouldn’t cause a fuss.”“What are you doing?”“Still figuring it out,” Prancer said.  “You recognize anyone?”“Few people.  You want me to gather ’em?”“Please.  We might have to take it outside.  Actually, let’s definitely take it outside.  By the side door.  So the owner doesn’t complain.”“You’ve piqued my interest,” Velvet said.Prancer nodded, still lost in thought.  He watched as she walked away, pausing to feel a moment of fondness for her, and then resumed his thinking.  He made his way to the side door.“Hey,” Blindside said.“Hey.  Gathering some people.  Thought we’d come to you, invite you to hear me out.”“Thanks, Prancer.  What’s this about?”“Give me a second to think.  I’m a salesman, and I’ve got to figure out exactly what I’m pitching.”“Sure.”Prancer stuck his fist out, stopped where Blindside’s power made it stop.  He felt Blindside tap a fist against the side of his hand.The others assembled.  The people who had been invited, then the people who hadn’t, who were curious.“I want to organize,” he started.  “I’m not the person to lead it, don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a power play.  I’m not a power player.  But I think, right now, while we’re still at peace, while there aren’t so many people who have beefs with one another, or the beefs have had two years to go quiet, this would be the chance to do it.”“You wouldn’t be the first person to think about doing this,” Biter said.“No?”“No, some other groups, some small, some large.  They’re banding together, a mutual peace.  Forming a set of rules and expectations that aren’t unwritten, that we actually discuss and work out.”“With the little guys?” Prancer asked.  “B-listers?  Those of us who aren’t being focused on while the big guys are laying out tracts of territory and settlements?”“Some of them.  Those groups are smaller than you’d be talking, if you’re talking about everyone here.”Prancer nodded.He glanced at Velvet, and he saw the way she was looking at him, and he felt like a proper man for the first time.  She reached for his hand and squeezed it, hard.Then, more alive and excited than he’d seen her in a long, long time, Velvet spoke, “You think they’d be open to talking?”“I think they might,” Biter said.                                                                                             Flare – 2.1                                                                                             “The Wardens are cooperating with seven major cape teams and, last I checked, ten minor teams.  We are not a monolithic entity.  We are not an authority.  We are not the bad guys, Julia.”I rummaged through a cabinet.  My life was in boxes, from my clothes to my hair and skin stuff to my files.  If it were that alone, it would have been tolerable.  I’d tried using logic and going to the most common sense places.  Not in or among the dirty dishes, not in the various jars and vases of spoons and spatulas on the counter, not behind or under something.  I’d checked the other rooms in the apartment.“People are worried.  You have Legend as a second in command, and memories aren’t so short that we don’t remember the Alexandria fiasco.”I moved methodically through the kitchen, left to right, while the television played on a low volume.“I can tell you this: all we want to do is help.  We want to find the right capes for the major crises and we want to equip the teams out there with information and resources. ““That’s admirable, but-““No, wait, hold on, Julia.  You told me when you asked me to have a chat with you on camera that you wanted to have a conversation.  Let me say this.”I looked at the little TV in the corner of the kitchen.“…that people are going to draw on what they know to fill the blanks, when they don’t have enough information.  I understand that the closest parallel that many Americans draw to the Wardens is the PRT.  Give us time to make our impression and show how we operate,” Chevalier said.“Would you not say there are quite a few of those blanks when it comes to your organization?” the reporter asked.“I accepted this interview because I want to fill some of those blanks.”“Are you an open book, then?”My eyebrows went up.  That was dirty pool from reporter Julia.  There was no way that question wouldn’t be followed by something that Chevalier couldn’t or wouldn’t want to answer, cornering him.“Some of those blanks,” Chevalier said, stressing the ‘some’.  “We’re still figuring things out, we’re still finding our footing and we’re negotiating a comfortable and healthy position with the public, the various teams under our umbrella, teams that aren’t under our umbrella, and the authorities.  The lack of answers and the number of blanks isn’t me being evasive or underhanded.  It’s that the Wardens and society as a whole have a lot of figuring out to do.”He was good at what he did, and he did a lot.  I wished I was in a position to study what he was saying and how he was fielding the questions, but I had more hunting to do.I went back to the drawers I’d already checked, pulling out the cutlery drawer enough that I could check the back, behind the tray that held the forks and knives.  I was too used to drawers having a mechanism that stopped them once they were pulled out to their limit, and I’d expected it to be longer, which led to me pulling the drawer straight out of its housing.I only barely caught it, sticking my knee out under it and moving my hands to grab the sides.  The cutlery rattled loudly, with a few miscellaneous cheese and holiday themed knives clattering to the floor.“…would you say about the rumors circulating around Valkyrie, then?”I put the drawer on the countertop, collected the fallen knives, and sorted through the contents, lifting up the tray to make sure nothing had fallen beneath.  No luck.I tried to put the drawer back, failed a few times before realizing that the construction wasn’t especially sturdy, and that the back end had pulled a bit loose.  I fixed it, then resumed trying to put it back inside the hole it was meant for.There was the saying: affordable, nice, or safe and sane.  Pick one.  It was a chronic problem with the speed they were trying to get buildings and houses up.  Shoddy construction, rush jobs, cut corners, mistakes, and general ugliness were pretty normal.  I was hopeful that in a little while we might be able to get to a point where it was ‘pick two’ instead of ‘pick one’, but we had a ways to go.I tried to squeeze the end together where two pieces didn’t quite meet and simultaneously push it in with my stomach.  It refused to slide in.“What are you doing to my kitchen?”Crystal was in the doorway, her hair a mess.  She wore an oversized t-shirt and pyjama shorts, and she still looked half asleep.“Did I wake you?” I asked.“Uh huh,” she said, sleepy.  “Don’t tell me you’re a morning person.  That would be a problem.”“I’m not.  I’m a person who fell asleep early last night-”“Almost right after eating.  Yep.  And now you’re up, showered, dressed, and you’re dismantling my kitchen.  For reasons.”“I woke up and thought I’d keep my normal work routine while I figure out what I’m doing.”“Renovating my kitchen?”“I’m trying to find scissors,” I said.  “I’d settle for a sharp knife.”Crystal smiled wide, her eyes still sleepy.  She grabbed a glass from a cabinet, and she half-walked, half-floated across the kitchen.“Don’t laugh,” I said.“You’re such a cliche,” she said, as she passed me on her way to the sink.  “Oh my god, Victoria.  You’re that person with super strength that trashes everything she touches.”“Just help me,” I said.She reached over and helped me hold the drawer together.  As it slid into the confines of the front of the counter, the framing held it together where the drawer’s own construction wouldn’t.“I wasn’t using my super strength, for the record,” I said.“Yeah.  I’ve done that with the drawers before, I’m just making fun of you.  It’s a funny image, to walk into the kitchen and see that.”“Ah ha,” I said.  “Then can I make fun of you for having two big jars of spatulas, whisks, spaghetti scoops, having two food processors-”“One was a gift.”“-And no scissors or shears anywhere I can find?  I’d settle for a sharp knife.  You have those steak knives, but they look nice and I don’t want to use them for the wrong thing and ruin them.”She reached across the counter to get the package of bacon, holding it up.  It was inside a hard plastic tupperware-like container with a small black and white label stuck to it.  A mark stamped on it had it sourced from another world.  Even without the mark, the pricetag might have given it away.“Thought I’d treat you to breakfast,” I said.  “Went for a walk to get some stuff.”Still appearing half asleep, she moved one hand, creating a deep red forcefield behind the bacon, then she produced a thin laser from her fingertip, slicing off the end of the package.She handed the bacon to me, open end up.“You don’t have scissors?”She shook her head, smiling.I sighed, picking up the bowl where I’d already mixed the dry ingredients.  “Fruit crepes, bacon on the side?”“Sounds amazing,” she said, leaning against the counter, eyes mostly closed.“You look beat,” I said.“It was pretty unforgiving, being there.  I timed everything so I could unwind starting with the barbecue, and unwinding didn’t happen.”I nodded.  “Sorry.”“That’s not on you.”“I’m still sorry it happened.”“You slept okay though?”“I slept a solid ten hours.  I just… started sleeping at six thirty or something.  Then I woke up, I started thinking, and I decided to be productive.  I’m talking to some teams today.”“If you want me to put a good word in with my guys, I’d be happy to.”“I don’t want to do the quasi-military cape thing,” I said.  “A little bit too intense.”“Yeah,” Crystal said.  “I’m so physically tired, two days out, that I’m not sure I would be standing if I couldn’t fly.”I looked down at the ground.  Her feet were barely touching the ground.It wasn’t the physical intensity that worried me.  It was the mental and emotional cost.  It was the fact that when it came to the military and the military-like stuff, the trend was to beat the individual into shape.  Organization, conformity.I couldn’t take much more of the harsh lessons on identity or the forced redefining of the self.“I’m just waking up, so forgive me if I got something wrong, but did you already find a place?”I shook my head.“You  took the sheets off the couch.”I looked over at the living room.  There were boxes stacked around, and only half were mine.“You said you might have friends over at some point, I thought it’d be weird if you had to navigate around my stuff, so I moved it out of the way.”“Okay,” she said.  She paused.  “I’m tired, so I want to make sure I say this right.”I went to the fridge to get the fruit stuff I’d already prepared.“I don’t care,” she said.  “First of all, I know I have a lot of stuff.  You know I have a lot of stuff.”I looked at the stuff around the kitchen and adjacent living room.  It was a bit messy, to the point counter space and table space was occupied.“Just- I really don’t care if you add your stuff to it.  I like my places feeling lived in.  Some of the stuff is a friend’s, and they’ll take it when they get set up.  Some is mom and dad’s.  Some is yours, and that’s fine.  That leads me to my second point.  I want you to be here.  I want you to feel comfortable.”“Thank you.”“I know my couch isn’t much, but you need a place that you can kick your shoes off and leave them where they are.”I might have mentioned that I wasn’t quite that personality type, but I held my tongue.  I understood the sentiment, what she wanted.“I want you to have a place that’s yours, Vic.”⊙“I’ll start by asking this: why not be independent?”Foresight had a strong aesthetic running through their costumes.  Primary among those things was a mask or helmet design where each of the members of the team lacked eyeholes.  Helmets with opaque visors, masks without eyes.  The aesthetic involved lots of paneled body armor and loose fabric elsewhere, with iconography worked into the panels.  It made me think of ninjas from movies, with the mix of lightweight costumes and armor, but without the Eastern style.Their team symbol was a stylized eye, sans pupil, with a wildly exaggerated ‘4’ struck out in bold lines that extended well past the curved lines of the eye.I was wearing my best civilian clothes.  I’d opted to leave the mask off.  I sat in a chair.  Two of them sat in chairs in the office, and another two stood at the side.I gave my answer.  “If I’m being entirely honest, independent doesn’t pay unless you’re really good.  At the risk of sounding arrogant, in another time and place, I think I could scrape by because I do have that experience, I have the knowledge, and I can hold my own.”“You don’t think you could do it now?” Countenance asked.  He was the second in command and the highest ranking team member in the room.  His outfit was heavier and draped more than the others, both in how the cloth hung loose and how the armor panels were connected so they dangled from the piece above.  The Foresight icon was in the center of his mask, like a cyclopean eye.“I know who Foresight is and how you operate,” I said.  “I know you want to move forward, you’re interested in helping the little guys, tackling the right issues, and take decisive, needed action in a calculated, smart way.”“You read our webpage.”“I’ve been following Foresight since it started,” I said.  “Whatever answer  you give me today, I’ll be following you guys from here on out, because I think it’s important to know the lay of the land.  Which goes back to what I was saying.  Being calculated, being smart.  I’ve been watching and researching you guys, and I’m sure you have the mentality where, from the time I reached out about an interview, you were looking me up and asking questions.  Which means you heard about the incident at the Norfair community center.”“Yes.  We talked to your reference about it.  I imagine he talked to you?”“He didn’t, but he’s busy and this interview happened on short notice,” I said.  “Everything that unfolded there and a lot of what I see elsewhere, it suggests that it would be really hard to make it as an independent.  Too many want to blame parahumans for what happened, and both independents and fledgling teams are easily targeted.  Established teams absorb and diffuse that impact.  That aside, being part of a team, cooperating, having the information and sharing that information, it’s too crucial.  That’s why I’m not going independent, given the chance.  I want to help build something.”Countenance nodded.  He reached over to his friend, who handed over the paperwork he’d been reading.  He looked down.  “Your reference sang your praises.”“He’s a great guy.  I really respect what he’s trying to do with something as tricky as the patrol block.”“Our problem, when it comes to assessing any candidate, is that each person we add to our teams is added strength, added power, but they’re also a possible set of complications.  It forces us to strike a balance.  We’re smaller than many of our peers because we’re selective.  We want to make sure anyone we add will be a good fit, with minimal complications.”“I reached out to Foresight first, to you, because I like how you do things.  It’s what and who I want to be.”“Then my next question to you would be what you think is going to happen next,” Countenance said.“What I think is going to happen?  I think trouble is incoming.  We see hints of it, the out-of-control triggers, we hear about some scary monsters and then the big names go and try to handle it, then we have other circumstances where the big names are running off to go handle things that they don’t tell anyone about.  I think those situations might be worse than the monsters.  So far, Gimel is untouched by the worst of it.  We’ve been on top of things.  But sooner or later, something is going to hit us that we aren’t prepared for and can’t neatly handle.”“What do you think happens then?”“I think it depends a lot on us having the right information and tools.”Beside Countenance, Anelace was nodding.  Anelace was a young guy, his costume the opposite of Countenance’s in how it was tighter-fitting, his mask bearing a dark gray dagger illustration on the right side of the white surface in the same exaggerated style the ‘4’ was drawn on the emblem on his chest.  The knotted area where hilt, blade, and the two prongs of the guard all met was located where one of his eyes would be.“You said you know how we operate?”“Support work with the megalopolis and police, patrols and events for the day to day.  Several times a week you make calculated, strategic strikes on priority targets.  It’s like what the Wardens are doing with the big, scary threats, but you’re more city-focused than whatever’s going on outside of Gimel.  A lot of your members go on to work with them, which is why you have openings.”“She does her research,” Anelace said.“She does,” Countenance said.  He said it in a way that suggested he was admitting it, almost reluctant.My heart sank.I looked over my shoulder.  The two at the side of the room were Effervescent and Relay.Effervescent was an emotion manipulator with an emphasis on stunning people.  Relay was capable of some complex moves with teleportation I wasn’t sure I had a grasp on, most of which seemed to amount to them teleporting to where others were, shunting that person to a random position elsewhere, and he also had some ability to communicate without words, both sending and receiving.“Can I ask?” I asked.“Ask?” Countenance asked me.I indicated the pair.  “I get the impression they’re communicating something to you, and you sound like you’re winding up to tell me no.  Both took some shifts at the portals, watching the refugees as they came in to make sure there was no trouble, which makes me think they’re thinkers, they read people, and they’re reading me.”Countenance turned his head to fix the cyclopean, drawn eye on the pair.“I can’t get a consistent read on you emotionally,” Effervescent said.  “It’s repressed.”“My long-time boyfriend was an emotion manipulator.  He had a hard time getting a read on me too,” I said.“I’m better than most when it comes to getting reads,” Effervescent said.  “No offense, but it’s what isn’t as repressed that concerns me.”“Enough you’d say no,” Countenance said.Effervescent nodded.“Relay?”“My read was fine.  Minimal secondary noise.”“Sorry,” Countenance said.  “For reading you without permission.  It’d be a point in your favor that you caught on, but-”“But you have to put stock in what the others say.  No hard feelings,” I said.  I made myself smile as I stood from my seat.  Countenance stood too.  He shook my hand.  “I’ll see you around, I hope we can work together then.”“I hope so too.  Good luck,” Countenance said.“Let me get the door for you,” Anelace said.  He jumped to his feet and opened the door for me.  His voice was quiet as he said.  “Sorry to see you go.”The thinkers would have noticed that.I wondered what Effervescent and Relay would be reporting about my emotional state as I left.⊙“Mrs. Dallon?”I stood from my seat in the waiting room.The cape had a costume that looked like a suit, metallic silver fabric, with a black dress shirt underneath.  His mask consisted of two panels that met and ran down the center of his face, creating an almost beak-like profile with how the two sides swept along the sides of his face and back.   Not bird-like, but as if his entire head was the beak.  The hair I could make out above the ‘v’ where the mask parted was longer and heavily styled.It reminded me of the Ambassadors from Boston, but I was pretty sure they wouldn’t have worn suits as ostentatious as this, nor such a dramatic full-face mask.“You didn’t come in costume?” he asked.  He sounded surprised.“I’m pre-identity adjustment,” I said, caught in trying to find my footing with my rehearsed explanation as I simultaneously crossed to where he was to shake his hand.  “Moving on from the identity and methodology I had as a teenage heroine.  I’m a blank slate, and there’s a lot of room to adjust my brand moving forward.”“Are you ex-Protectorate?” he asked.  “I might have missed that if it was in your application.”“No.  Ex-Ward, but only very briefly.”“I only ask because you went straight to the term ‘brand’.  I’m used to hearing it from people who were in the PRT and people from other corporate teams.  I know I read your file and there was no mention of a corporate background.  I’m Lark.  You’ll meet Dido soon, all going well.”“It’s nice to meet you, Lark.”“My office is this way, if you’ll join me,” he said.  He briefly touched the small of my back to guide me in the direction his other hand was indicating.I was bothered by the contact.  Unsolicited touching, the presumed closeness, and the fact it was a hot day, my back was damp from the walk and he would have felt that.It was such an unnecessary thing and it made both of us uncomfortable.“Brockton Bay,” he said.“Yes.  From birth to Endbringer and immediate aftermath.”“A mom and pop small town team?”“Aunt and uncle and cousins too,” I said.  “Extended family.  They passed the fifteen year mark with just donations and small events.  I think that counts for something.”“It’s better than what Dido and I have managed, but give us time.  We have five parahumans on the team, and we’re already in the black when it comes to the business end of things.”“I spent most of my childhood watching my mom balance the books, I did the events, the photoshoots, the merchandising as a PRT-acknowledged team.  I have something of a sense of what you’re probably going for.”“Ah, the merchandising.  I think I have your PRT trading card from that time period in a binder in my office.”I smiled.  “Which one?  I had one that was holographic, which you could swipe through the controller for the video game to have me as a polygon-rendered helper, and the higher quality one that had the bio on the back.”“I think it was the second one.  My office is through this door.”I took a seat opposite the glass-top desk while he closed the door.  He undid the button in his suit jacket before sitting down.“Typically those of us at Auzure like to work with new parahumans,” he said.  “They’re easier to brand.  When we work with capes with a history, we like that history to be a strong one.”“I think you get the best of both worlds with me,” I said.  “Most people assumed I was dead when everything happened in Brockton Bay, and nobody corrected that misunderstanding.  If you do dig up information about me, a lot of it is strong.”“I think that’s where we run into problems,” he said.  “A lot of your history and presence is tied into your family’s group identity.  ‘Glory Girl’ isn’t famous beyond a certain range.  Hometown heroine, yes, with some people in Boston and New York who might know of you, but not famous.”“Then consider me new.  Untainted by the past.”“I would, but we use things we term perception turns, or just turns.”“I know the term,” I said.“I like that you do.  Branding, turns.  You do seem to know what you’re getting into here.  When we’re tracking someone’s marketability, we map out the turns.  You’re fine, nothing exceptional, for most of your career, with an upturn if you count your disappearance, after the Slaughterhouse Nine.”I took a deep breath, then nodded.“But if we include your family, there’s a lot of baggage.”“You could say that,” I said.“Downturn, death of Fleur.  Downturn, times when New Wave was subsisting, but not in the eyes of the media.”“Four adolescents and two couples, there were weeks where school or work took priority.  That got better as my cousins and I got older.”“Cousins… and your sister?” he asked.I felt the shock like it was cold water.He continued, “I think if it were up to the turns and the background alone, it would have to be a no.  At the time you should have been drawing the most attention, given your age and potential, you… died, as you put it.  You were gone for the two years before Gold Morning.”“Yes,” I said.“We’re offering cape services for the reconstruction, with Spell offering some massive assistance with the argriculture.  It’s a big part of what’s driving us to the front pages, giving us some upturn in the most general sense, for public perception.  What we really want is the human angle, something where we could have an attractive young lady like yourself in a photo op, or your sister-”“No,” I said.“Her and the right person in a photograph?  If you two paired up, Auzure could make you big.”I winced, and I stood from my seat.“Victoria?”They hadn’t accepted the interview to get me for me.  I was just a stepping stone to the person they really wanted.“Thank you for your time,” I said.I managed to restrain myself from slamming the door on the way out.⊙“Thanks for meeting us out here,” Whorl said.  He didn’t shake my hand, but instead reached out to clasp my wrist.  I clasped his.“Not a problem,” I said.  I looked up at the structure that had been erected around the portal.  It cast a shadow.  “It’s nice to be in the shade, with a decent breeze.”Whorl wore a blue mask with a white border around the eyes and outermost edge, and his costume was a ‘preppy’ bodysuit, complete with a folded collar, like a polo shirt, a narrow belt, and leggings.  His icon was large on his chest, a circle with angled spokes at the edges.  He had an armband with the gold morning symbol on it, but the colors were the blue and white of his costume.He grinned, showing off white teeth.  “You should have been here at noon.  It was brutal.”“The people weren’t too irritable, with the heat?”All around us, people were coming through the portal, forming lines.  There were buildings to the left and right of the street that people were heading into, to get the instructions and things necessary to start their lives in Gimel.“I think they were happy for it,” Whorl said. “I’ve been going back and forth, and it’s miserable on the other side.”“I just realized I got us started on a conversation about the weather,” I said.“I’m kind of a weather manipulator, not really, but it’s fun to say.  Talking about the weather happens more than you’d think, when it comes to me,” he said.Again, that smile with those very white teeth.“I read up on you online,” I said.“Ah, did you?  Should I be flattered or worried that I’ve been stalked?”I was reminded of the segment on television, the reporter trying to corner Chevalier by getting him to claim a certain attitude.“It’s not stalking,” I said.  “I’m doing my homework, is all.”I had to admit, the preppy look with the wide shoulders, narrow waist, clean cut and nicely taken care of, it appealed to me, and it had always.  Not that I was even remotely thinking of actually moving forward with a relationship.“I’m probably going to have to duck out and handle some minor crisis or another, but stick around and don’t disappear on me, we’ll find the time and figure out if we can place you with the Attendant.”“That’d be great.”“If I get caught up in something, find one of the others.  Chat with them, they’ll tell you what they think of the team.”There were a few other capes distributed across the crowd.  It was interesting how people seemed so keen on them, even approaching them, happy to see them.  The sentiment of blame hadn’t gripped the refugees here.A teenager with a moon design on her mask and dress-like costume.I saw a humanoid mech the size of a car, with a glass tank for the ‘body’, something large and fishlike within the tank.   The mech sat on its ass, feet sticking out, and children were crowding around to tap the glass and climb on the feet.  The tinker, as I took it, was the one sitting on the suit’s shoulder.  Another cape was standing on the end of a rod, three stories above the ground, the end of the rod stuck into the side of the building.  He looked stern as he looked down at the scene, his arms folded, until someone waved up at him and he waved back.“Is that the whole team?”“Not even close.   With the teams merging, we’re taking on a lot of others.  We’ll be breaking up into three sub-teams later, but all with the same name and brand.”“I don’t know if I’m hurting my chances saying this, but I’m kind of crossing my fingers you guys are going with the Shepherd’s name and brand, but the Attendant’s approach.”Whorl smiled again.  “We might be.”“I like the approach,” I said.“How do you interpret it?”“Giving people security.  Moving slowly, with measured steps, informed by the lessons of the past.  You guys seem pretty focused on taking and holding territories, improving neighborhoods.  After what happened at the Norfair community center, I think giving people time to get used to capes again is key.”“I think it might be,” Whorl said.Above, the cape that was standing on the end of the horizontal pole whistled.  As we looked up, he pointed.“That’s my cue,” Whorl said.  “No pun intended.  I’ll be right back.”Whorl headed toward the building that the people were filing out of, moving at a light jog, with a fog-like nimbus building at his shoulders and arms.I looked at the various capes, debating my options.  I worried that flying up to say hello to the one at the end of the pole would spook him and make him fall from his roost, and I wasn’t that keen on flying.That left two options.  The tinker or the teenage girl with the moon iconography.I made my way toward the girl, because she had less people around her.  The crowd was a bit of a tide I had to work against.“Stuck?” I heard a voice.I turned my head.  It was a man with tattoos, a cleft chin and eyes that looked like he was perpetually squinting, even in the shade of the gate that housed the Bet-Gimel portal.  He was talking to a couple.“It’s a big decision.  We’re not farmers.”“It’s hard, getting started again,” the guy with the tattoos said.  “The tent cities are rough, while you wait for an available apartment.  You can work your ass off, earn fake ‘dollars’ that might not have value in a few weeks or months, you sweat, you hurt, and everyone around you is doing the same.  Stinks, when everyone’s working that hard and getting only a few minutes to shower.”“We’ve heard of things like that.”“If you want another option, we’ve got a settlement at Canaan.  Small city, even.  Or a big town.  We’ve got extra rooms, food, and dangerously strong alcohol.  We’re still trying to figure that out.”I heard the rustle of papers.“Canaan?” I asked.“Yes.  Have you been?”“I’ve heard stories,” I said.  I turned to the couple, “I’m ninety percent sure the Canaan area is Fallen territory.  Outskirts of the megalopolis.”“We’re not really holding fast to all of that anymore,” the guy with the tattoos said.  “We said the world would end, we tried to draw attention to it, the world ended, we were right.  Now we make the best of things.”“That seems like a pretty skewed take,” I said.He rolled his eyes as he looked away from me.  He turned back to the couple.  “You have the directions.  Easy to catch a bus to New Haven, catch another bus to the Hartford Stretch.  Go to the address, we almost always have someone with a ride waiting there for the buses, to drive you into Canaan.  The hard work has been done, it’s easier, it’s more fun, and there’s actual community.  It’s one of the things that’s strangely missing from most parts in this city.  You’ll notice that.”“Maybe,” the guy from the couple said.  “I’ll keep this.”“McVeay, Crowley, or Mathers?” I asked.The guy shot me an annoyed look.  “What?”“Which family branch were or are you?”  I asked.  I turned to the couple.  “Three branches, each loosely themed after one of the Endbringers.  There was a nascent fourth in twenty-thirteen that was based on one or all of the other three, but I missed the memo on that.”“Crowley,” the guy said.  “We were the jackasses.”“McVeays were the ultra-religious, more violent ones, loosely themed after Behemoth,” I said.  “Mathers were the ones themed after the Simurgh.  They’re still around too, they did a lot of the kidnappings of kids and capes, with intent to force marriages.  Then you have the Crowleys, who were a little bit more than jackasses.  Stirring panic, scaring people, violence.”“To draw attention to the imminent end of the world,” the guy with the tattoos said.  “Do you want us to apologize for trying to get people’s attention and failing?  Or should we not have tried?  We were right.”“Is there a problem?”A woman’s voice.  I thought it was the girl with the moons on her costume.  It wasn’t.  Another woman with tattoos, with friends.  One of the tattoos was of a bat-winged schlong.  Another was of a cartoon character I didn’t recognize getting spit-roasted, in the metal pole, open fire sense.She had others, but I couldn’t see enough of them to tell what they were.  I could guess they were similarly tasteful.  Her top was tied at the sternum, exposing ribs and stomach.“Just a bit of one,” I said.  “You guys are openly recruiting from this crowd here?”“Recruiting is an strange way to put it,” the guy with the tattoos said.I looked at the couple.  “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  Free rent, free food, drinks, company?”“Cheap rent,” the woman with the tattoos said.  “A lot of people stay just long enough to make some extra money while commuting to Hartford and paying rent to us.”“All we ask is that people who decide to go make sure to tell people that hey, we aren’t assholes,” the tattooed guy said.“We aren’t assholes!” the burly guys who were keeping the woman company cheered in near-unison.“Which Crowley is in charge?” I asked.“Hey, bitch,” the woman said.  “Just move on.  Fuck off.”The cheering had drawn attention.  The teenage girl with the moons on her costume approached, ducking beneath one of the burly guy’s arms.  She spotted me, saw that last exchange, and drew close to me, putting one hand on my shoulder.“You’re the one Whorl was talking to?” she asked.“Yeah.”“Take it from me, it’s not worth it.  Come on.”The guy with the tattoos smirked.“You know they’re recruiting here, right?” I asked.“We know,” she said.  “We’ve drawn attention to it.  We were told to keep out of it, so long as they behave.”She put pressure on my shoulder, urging me to move.  I took one step back.I didn’t want to let this go.  I would have more regrets if I walked away.“Which Crowley?” I asked.  “There were three brothers and one sister, last I heard.”“Doesn’t matter,” the tattooed guy said.“Eldest brother was a murderer, got ousted from the family for that, back in twenty-eleven, when the Fallen were still minor.  But around the time their numbers swelled in twenty-twelve, early twenty-thirteen, he got accepted back, head of the Crowley branch.  He killed two of his own family members after that.  I think that matters a lot, since if he’s in charge, you can’t really call yourselves mere jackasses.”“Not him.”There were a few more faces appearing in the crowd.  Unfriendly.The girl with the moon design leaned in close, murmuring in my ear, “They have someone with powers in the crowd.  They send people out to fish for recruits, and if there’s trouble, they have these reinforcements summoned into the middle of the crowd and they’ll shout you down.”“Okay,” I said.  “Middle brother and the sister were pretty skeevy too.  They didn’t kidnap anyone directly, but they networked with the other families, gave shelter to some McVeays who needed to duck the attention of the law, and they traded a few of their family members for some of the kidnapped minors and capes the Mathers family had.  I’d be concerned about going to that camp.”“The little brother,” the guy with the tattoos said.“The party animal,” I said.“That’s what we’re about!” were the shouts.  There was more of a raucous response from the other reinforcements.  Cries and shouts of ‘party’.  People throughout the crowd were looking.“He’ll try to steal your girlfriend before he makes you welcome!” I had to raise my voice to be heard.  The people who were pushing forward made it harder for me to see the couple.  “It’s not worth it.  You can look him up at a library.  Jake Crowley!  Four wives, all half his age!”There were shouts and bellows of denial, a few swears directed my way.  One ‘cunt’, from someone close enough to have punched me if he’d felt the desire.“Throw away the paper,” I called out.  “It’s not worth it!”With the press of bodies, I didn’t see the paper get thrown away.  But I saw the guy hugging his girlfriend closer, I saw the fractional nod.That was all I got.  The moon girl pushed me harder, and I allowed myself to be pushed this time.I walked backward out of the crowd, looking at the group.  They were still making a lot of noise.Whorl was waiting for me as I made my exit from the thicker part of the crowd.  The mech tinker was standing on the head of his suit, now, and the suit was standing too, which gave him a decent vantage point overlooking everything.“It’s going to take an hour before they settle down,” Whorl said.  “What was that about?”“Fallen recruiters,” I said.“I know that much.”“I wanted to make sure the people they were talking to knew,” I said.  “Told them who the family was, how they operated, who the leader was.”“You think they listened?” Moon girl asked.“They might have,” I said.  “I didn’t get the impression I was going to start a riot, so I thought I’d be okay trying.”“Nah,” Whorl said, “Your impression was fine.  No riot.  They know to keep their hands to themselves, and just to be loud.  They stick to the rules so they can keep coming back.  We were told to let them, which sucks, but we have to work with the authorities.”“I told her that,” Moon girl said.  “That we were supposed to leave it be.”“Before or after she stirred them up?”“Before,” I answered for her.  “I knew, I went ahead anyway.”Whorl frowned.“I knew it would probably cost me my spot on the team,” I said.Whorl nodded slowly.“But if it stops one person from going over to that town of theirs… I guess it’s worth it.”“It might have worked,” Whorl said, “But they’ve got the reinforcements, they’ll double down.  They’ll try harder, make up for it.”“You guys are all about learning from the mistakes of the past,” I said.  “Paying respect to the casualties.  You have to know they can’t be allowed to get a foothold.  They’re too monstrous, and the people they’re going after are too vulnerable.”“They have a foothold already,” he said.  “We’re the guys who failed to stop the end of the world, and they’re the ones who were right about it.  To some people that’s all that matters.  It doesn’t matter that they’re scumbags or that they’re dangerous.  Not everyone, but even one out of every thirty is a lot.”“We should go calm things down,” Moon girl said.“Yeah,” Whorl said.  “Distract the people from the tattooed hooligans.”“Good luck with that,” I said.“Take care, Victoria.  Keep fighting the good fight, whatever you end up doing.”I gave him a two finger salute.I braced myself, both in balance and emotionally, then took to the air, moving slowly.  I raised myself up to the same level as the guy at the end of the pole, staying within his field of vision so I wouldn’t surprise him.They were using the powers to teleport people in.  I couldn’t see where the fade-in happened or where the teleportation destination was, but as the crowd shuffled, there were more of the people with tattoos, trashy people, and people that didn’t look like refugees.The guy on the end of the pole pointed.  I moved closer to him, and followed the line of his arm and finger to see.A man with a daughter, sitting on a blanket at the base of a fence.“The girl or the man?” I asked.“The man.  He’s the one bringing them in.  Keeps the kid close as a shield, in case someone catches on.  Different kids, some days.”I nodded.“I think every day of going over there and taking him out of the picture.  Letting him know I know.”“Wouldn’t be worth it,” I said.The noises of the crowd of Fallen increased, a fresh chant.  Heads were turning and people were smiling, because they didn’t know, and positivity and high energy meant a lot when they were as tired and despondent as they were.  Some would have spent a long time waiting for their chance to come through.A dangerous and vulnerable thing, to have no place to go.                                                                                             Flare – 2.2                                                                                             There was something to be said about the fact that the hospital was still in construction while it was running.  There were patients in the waiting room, sitting in the chairs that had been bolted to the floor, and the unhappiness of needing a hospital visit was compounded by the fact that a third of the way across the room, behind a plastic sheet that had been taped to walls, ceiling and floor, a team was using power tools and calling out in loud voices as they built the rest of the room.The hospital staff looked pretty miserable too, most of them sequestered on the other side of a counter, walled off from the patients by a plexiglass window.  Security guards stood off to one side.“Can I help you?” a secretary asked.“I was wondering if it was possible for me to see a patient?”“Visiting hours are open.  Patient’s name?”“Fume Hood.  I don’t know her real name.”The secretary stopped, then looked at the male secretary, who sat at the other end of the counter.  She looked past him at the security guard.Of course.“I was one of the people giving her medical attention when the ambulance arrived,” I said.  I knew it wouldn’t matter, that they would assume I’d been lying, but I hoped it would temper the reaction.“She’s not accepting visitors,” the secretary said.“One second,” I heard.  A female voice.Two overlapping sections of the plastic sheet peeled apart.  Tempera ducked through, and put the tacky sides of the plastic back together.  She was dusty from plaster and streaked with paint that wasn’t from her power.  She wore overalls, a black t-shirt for a top, and had a different pattern to the paint she’d applied over her eyes with fingers, more like she had applied it to her fingers and pressed them to her eyes as a series of vertical bars, each bleeding into the one beside it.“Hi, Victoria,” she said to me.“Hi.”She looked at the secretary, “We know her.  Can I take her back to the room?”“Let me get her information, and I’ll buzz you two through.”I took the clipboard with the paperwork, and I filled out the information, checking my phone to remind myself of the specifics of Crystal’s address.  She took the clipboard, read it over, and let us through.We walked down the back halls of the hospital, past individual clinics and their signs and separate waiting areas, past patient rooms and nurse’s stations.  Tempera indicated the turns.  We didn’t rush it, an unspoken agreement that we’d take our time, have a chance to talk.“There was one attempt on her life.  We were worried there would be another,” Tempera said.“Are you standing guard?” I asked.“I am keeping an eye on things, but mostly by accident.  I’ve been helping with the construction.  I like getting my hands dirty,” Tempera said.  She smiled as she held up one hand, which was covered in wet white ‘paint’ down to the elbow, the paint turning black before transitioning to her light brown skin.  “Look at you, though.  You look tidy.”Tidy.  It was an amusing choice of words, when Tempera looked anything but.  I smiled.  “Looking around to see if any teams are looking to fill positions.”“And?”“Only one was actually posting any openings, a corporate team, Auzure.  Foresight and the Attendant were open to interviewing me.  There are two other big teams; one gave me a hard no, and the other is folding into the Attendant and won’t exist soon, they didn’t give me a response yet, and with how the talk with the Attendant went, I don’t think it’d work out.”“They’re pretty conservative.  In a lot of respects.  A lot of the religious capes went to the Shepherds and will be part of the Attendant.  I’ve been paying close attention to that.”“Yeah,” I said.  “One or two of the sketchy people from Empire Eighty-Eight, too.”“Empire Eighty-Eight?  They sound familiar.”“They had a presence for a while.  A few years back they broke up into two other groups.  The Pure and Fenrir’s Chosen.”“Ah.  I know the Chosen.  They were linked to the Clans, I think?”“Yes.  The Clans spread out across multiple cities, and would funnel anyone who got powers over to the Empire Eighty-Eight core group, back before Leviathan broke the group’s back.  They were a background element in my childhood and cape career.”“Ahh.  Was that a factor in your wanting to join?”A very carefully neutral question, that.  I wondered if she was prodding me, not declaring a stance while feeling me out.  I was still an unknown, in a way.“Violent racists on the team?  Definitely a factor, big point against.  Question is, are they ex-violent, ex-racists?  Gets muddier.  Even then, I might draw the line there, and not join.  If they were contrite?  I could roll with that, I think.  Barring one or two especially scummy individuals.  Interview didn’t get far enough for me to raise the subject.”Tempera nodded, not saying anything.“I think… maybe I’m being unsubtle, saying it, but I think there’s a big difference between who those guys were and who Fume Hood is.”“I think so too.”“How is she?”“She’s hurt by what happened.  It’s hard, to put yourself out there, face your shortcomings, try to be better, and get shot for it.”“Partial facing of shortcomings, from what she and I talked about,” I said.“It’s why I said face, instead of ‘admit’,” Tempera said.  “But I don’t want to quibble.  Change of subject.  You said your meeting went badly.  Can I ask what happened?”“Fallen,” I said.“Did you get in another fight?”“No,” I said.  I sighed.  “No.  They did what they often do, they caused a disruption, and that’s a playing field that suits them well.  I’d call it a draw, but I’m pretty sure they’re still out there recruiting and I’m not out there counteracting that.”“There will always be bad guys.  They will always be out there.  There will always be murders, there will be theft, there will be drugs.”I nodded.“Question is,” Tempera said, “Where do you want to be, in relation to that, as it happens?”“That is a deceptively tricky question,” I said.“You definitely put yourself out there, backing us up when things went sideways at the community center.”“I really appreciate that you see it that way,” I said.“You put yourself in front of Lord of Loss.  I don’t know how your power works, but it’s obvious you can bleed.  There was some danger there.”I acknowledged that with a small nod.“And now you’re interviewing for teams?  So soon after?  It sounds like you want to be out there, helping.”“I do.  I’m zero for three, though.”“You don’t want to be independent?  Hold on a second.  We’re nearly at the room, but let’s finish talking before we go in.”We stopped midway down the hallway.  A nurse’s station was a short distance away.“I-” I started.  “I think, the way things are going, I might end up going that way.  Teams are a complication of their own.”“They are,” Tempera said.  “I had a phone call earlier, offering a position.  I can go right there and sign the paperwork if I want to.”“With?”“The Attendant, as it happens,” Tempera said.I was momentarily lost for words.  She’d been doing what I’d thought, inviting me to answer without declaring a position, but from a different angle.“I want to wait and see how the merger with the Shepherds shakes up, how it feels after, they said not to wait too long.  It’s decent money, decent exposure.  A lot of decency.”“Don’t let what I said change your mind on anything.  I’m griping, it’s-”“It’s fine,” she said.  “I invited you to gripe, if we’re going to use your word.  It’s interesting to hear that take on them.  I didn’t know about the racist ex-villains joining.  I’m curious about how they handled the Fallen there, too, in your situation.”“I think, uh, don’t tell them I said this…”“Of course.”“…I think they or the people they’re taking guidance from are approaching that stance of there always being bad guys to deal with, and they’re deciding to conserve their energy.  To not fight that fight.  Maybe it’s right to.”“You got a draw.  That’s better than a win for the bad guys there.”“It’s- yeah,” I said.  “I tried to use reason, draw on the stuff I studied, old knowledge I had about the group.  Who they were, how they operate, the families, the names.  Put that information out there, so the potential recruits would know the key facts.  I tried to get them to say who their leader was, pressed the issue, and of course it was the least bad one, so the argument I was gunning for didn’t have much clout, and I lost steam.”“I picture the Fallen as a group that’s pretty comfortable defying reason.”“Them, yes.  The recruits, I think they were open to hearing it.  I threw out some more information I remembered at the last second, but the Fallen were getting pretty loud, I didn’t want to start a riot, and that was more or less it.”“And the Attendant?”“Weren’t keen on me making a point of things when the word from on high was to let the Fallen be.  I didn’t get my invite to the team.”Tempera made a face.“I don’t like ignoring the monsters.  And I do think the Fallen are monstrous, as a collective force.”“They’re a headache I was always glad I wouldn’t have to deal with,” Tempera said.  She scratched her nose as she scrunched it up, the paint there highlighting the creases.  The scratching deposited more paint on the bridge.  “One I guess I’ll have to prepare myself for dealing with.  Or possibly not dealing with, if I take the Attendant’s offer.”“Possibly,” I said.  “Don’t give my words too much weight.”“I’ll try to be sensible about it.  I might end up asking those questions you didn’t get a chance to, if that’s okay.”I nodded.“I think I’ll be okay, whatever happens.  The Wardens facilitated Attendant’s contact with me, and from their tone, I think they’d push to get me on another team if I didn’t go with that one.”“That’s great,” I said.“I could put in a word for you.”“I wouldn’t say no,” I said.  “I don’t think I’ll get my hopes up, either.”Tempera frowned.“Sorry.  I didn’t mean to sound negative.”“Are you finding your way, with these setbacks?”I shrugged.  “Complicated.  Just wanted to check in on Fume Hood, while things are quiet.  When the law or the system fail to outline a process, do what seems right.  When it’s not clear what’s right, go with the law.  When neither is clear, reach out.”“For perspective?”I shrugged.  “That too.  More eyes on a problem never hurts.”“Another point for the team, instead of going independent,” Tempera said.  She looked back down the hall, in the direction we’d been walking to.  “Hold on a moment?  I’ll check if she’s decent.  I wouldn’t mind bringing Fume Hood into it, now that we’re past the semi-confidential stuff about other teams.”I nodded.She touched the wall by the door as she rounded the corner, stepping into the room, and she knocked on the door as she entered.There was a brief pause.  The handprint of paint on the wall dropped to the floor with a splat as Tempera said, “Come in.”The blob of paint on the door fell to the ground as well.  Both moved along the ground as I entered, spattering against the back of Tempera’s shoes and the back of her overalls.Fume Hood had donned a mask, but she didn’t wear the hood.  She lay down on the bed, which was angled so she could sit up at an angle.  A blanket had been pulled up to her waist, covering her legs.Crystalclear sat in the chair between her and the window, the crystal configuration on his head slightly different than before.  He wore a t-shirt and shorts.  There was something odd about a guy with crystals where his eyes and hair would be having very ordinary hairy legs.“Heya,” Crystalclear said.“Hi,” I said.“Hey, patrol girl with a name I can’t remember,” Fume Hood said.“Victoria,” Tempera volunteered.“Victoria.  Right.  Thank you for helping to hold my blood in,” Fume Hood said.“You’re very welcome,” I said.  I noted the flowers and cards sitting beneath the window.  “Sorry I didn’t bring anything.  This is my awkward ‘I was in the neighborhood’ visit.  I saw the hospital name and remembered you were brought out this way.”“I’ve got too much as it is.  Turns out that the key to popularity and acceptance is to get yourself shot.”Her tone was light, almost amused.  Tempera had said Fume Hood was hurt on an emotional level, but I didn’t see a sign of it.  I could remember how Tempera had acted on my first meeting with her, how in tune with her team she had been.  I was willing to put a lot of stock in her take on things.“Victoria, what I was going to say, before deciding I’d rather say it here, was that we’re going our separate ways, yes-”“Longscratch is already gone,” Crystalclear said.  “But I don’t think he was ever going to stick around on a permanent basis.”“Yes,” Tempera said.  “Which is a shame.  I do hope he finds what he’s looking for.  My point is, I don’t want to lose touch.  It’s helpful and nice that Crystalclear happened to be here to help illustrate that maintenance of contact.”“Happy to take credit,” Crystalclear said.“Victoria said- if you don’t mind me repeating?”“No.”“She said that it’s important to reach out, if I’m recalling that right.  I’d like to stay friends with you,” Tempera said.  “Crystalclear, Fume Hood.  Victoria, you too.”“Why?” Fume Hood asked.“What do you mean?” Tempera asked.“We’re very different people,” Fume Hood said.  “I don’t get how that works.  How do you stay in touch with people you have very little in common with?”“Easy.  Grab a bite sometime,” I said.  “Sandwich, beer or soda, share stories, get different perspectives.  I wouldn’t mind.”“That’d be nice,” Crystalclear said.“But-” Fume Hood started.  She frowned.  “Okay, whatever.”“You should find the words for what you’re trying to say,” I said.  “In case it festers or gets in the way.”“I dunno.  I don’t get why you’re here.  I’m grateful, don’t get me wrong.  You put pressure on my wound, Tempera gave me first aid and used her paint to keep me from dying.  I probably owe you my lives.  But that whole fiasco was my fault.”“I blame the attacking villains, not you,” Tempera said.“Yep,” Crystalclear said.“Are you trying to be clever and get me to keep being a hero, then?” Fume Hood asked.“I’m here because I was interested in how you were doing,” I said.  “Obviously I’d prefer it if you stayed a hero, but that’s not the objective.”“If you guys keep showing up with flowers or to make small talk, you make it awfully hard for me to fuck off and go back to being a villain.”“That’s a plus,” Tempera said.  “But like Victoria said, it’s not the main point.”“On the topic of pluses,” I said, “I’m interested in who those guys were.  So if you hear anything, I wouldn’t mind a heads up.”“The guy who shot me did so of sound mind, no Kingdom Come in play.  Independent, apparently.  No money in his accounts, he didn’t have internet.  He was just pissed off.”“There were the villains, too,” I said.“There were.”“And we don’t know what they were after,” Crystalclear said.“Multiple conflicting stories,” I said.  “Blindside lied to me when I asked.  It bothers me, and I worry it’ll happen again.”“Give me your cell phone number,” Tempera said.  “I’ll get in touch.”There was a brief pause while we sorted things out, me getting the contact information from each of the others, and giving them mine.  They already knew each other.Reaching out, making and maintaining contact.A part of me had hoped that Fume Hood was wrong, that the team wouldn’t have dissolved, that they’d be together, willing to give things another try.  That it might have been a team I could join.“The cards and flowers might have something to do with how you’re the topic of the moment,” I mused aloud.“I heard something about that,” Fume Hood said, indicating Crystalclear.“From me,” Crystalclear volunteered unnecessarily.“If you guys were to try again, there could be more attention, more support,” I said.“More gunshots?” Fume Hood asked.  “I’m stepping down and going into hiding.  I’ll recuperate, let the heat die down, and then figure out what I’m doing.”“If it matters, I think more people are siding with you than not,” I said.Fume Hood nodded a few times, taking that in.  “Weird.”“It’s good,” Tempera said.  “I think Crystalclear already accepted the offer from Foresight, though.”“It was a very promising offer.”“And I’ve been contacted by Attendant.  I don’t know what I’ll do with that.  And Victoria-”“Is not having much luck,” I said.  “But I want to do something.”“You were thinking you might go independent?”“Which doesn’t pay,” I said.  “Not in this environment.”“How does that work?” Fume Hood asked.  “If you’re a crook, it’s easy, you take jobs at the villain bar, or you rob some place, or any number of things.  You just… go out on patrol?”“There are a few other things to do,” I said.  “One way is to essentially run a protection racket that isn’t a racket.  It’s easy for that to go wrong.  There’s a higher level effect, which is easier to pull off when, say, a city has a downtown area and the shop owners gather together to pay a wage to the hero that draws attention and has a positive influence on their area…”“Things have to be stable before that happens,” Tempera said.“We’re not there yet,” I said.  “There’s training and support.  Offering powers for helping with the rebuilding, which Auzure was doing a bit of.  There’s merchandising, but that’s a dead market right now, I think.”“We fished in that pond prior to getting underway and we didn’t get any bites,” Crystalclear said.“I was selling my brain, I know a lot about capes and the community, having grown up with it.  That job’s done, and I don’t know if there’s much more opportunity for that.”“Tell you what,” Tempera said.  “I’ll put out feelers.  See what people say.”I nodded.  “Sure.  Thank you.”⊙I was lost in thought enough that my retracing of my steps on the way out of the hospital turned me in circles.  I approached the same nurse’s station for a second time, and I stopped at the desk, waiting for someone with a spare moment to give me directions.I wanted to do something.There weren’t any openings.  I was pretty sure Advance Guard had turned me down because of my background, the two year gap prior to Gold Morning.  Others had their reasons for rejecting me.  As it was, the field was fairly cluttered.  Villains were keeping their heads down.  As much as there was always going to be the bad guys, like Tempera had said, we didn’t have the systems in place to identify them or address them.No way to make money off of my powers, to pay the rent and get out of Crystal’s borderline uncomfortably cluttered place.“Yes?” a nurse asked.I blinked.  I didn’t ask her for directions.  My thoughts went in another direction, spurred to life by my thoughts of the unpaid cape work.“If I said ‘crisis points’, would that mean anything to you?” I asked.“It’s been a long time since I heard that.  Yes, it means something.  Do you work with capes?”“I… kind of am a cape.  Would you be open to me giving you a hand?”“Let me look into it.  I’m not sure what the usual methods are, and it’s not fresh in my mind.”“You’d want to identify the key patients, check with any parents, if they’re under eighteen, and they often are.  Then with me, you’d want to check with legal, you can call my references, which I do have on hand…”⊙The mask wasn’t the quality sort I was used to, more of a Halloween costume.  The top I wore was a men’s small, a little too big in the shoulder, while it simultaneously squashed my chest.From the ages of the patients in the pediatric wing, I wasn’t sure they would pay much mind to my chest, squashed or not.  Most were twelve or younger.  A few heads turned, people paying cursory attention.I still wore the skirt I’d worn to the interviews, the belt.Room 5, bed C.I entered room five.  There were four beds, one in each corner.  One monitor was beeping, the other kids were lying down, looking bored.Bed C was a little girl, with a face chock full of freckles, and sandy blonde hair.  The curtains had been partially closed, blocking the views of the boy sitting to her left and the girl sitting across from her.“Audrey?” I asked, peering in.I saw only a glimpse of misery on her expression, while she stared off out the window.  Then she raised her head and the expression was gone.  She assessed me, head to toe.“Great,” she said, after she was done.“Great?”“Ooh, yay, it’s Legend, except he’s a girl now,” she said, sarcastic.The t-shirt I wore was styled after Legend’s costume.  The mask was the same.  Something the staff had kept on hand from the past Halloween.“The nurses pointed me your way,” I said.“Well, my day sucked, but now fake Lady Legend is here, so I’m all better.  That’s great.”“I can take the mask off if you want,” I said.“Oh, no, you can’t do that, fake Lady Legend.  Your secret identity might be compromised!”The sarcasm ran strong through this one.I pulled the curtain closed a bit more, then pulled off the mask, flying a bit as I said, “I never really had the secret identity.”With that, at least, her eyebrows went up.  No smart retort.  She moved around her hospital bed, craning her head to see my feet, trying to spot the trick.“I don’t know you,” she said.“Doesn’t matter,” I said.  “The nurses mentioned you’d had an especially bad day.”Again, that momentary look of misery.Yeah, I knew that.“Back before everything turned sour, when I’d come to the hospital, with, um-” I stopped, drew in a breath, and sighed.  “It’s something heroes would do.  Check in on people who had really bad days.  And when I came to the hospital, sometimes I’d do that.”Crisis points.  More a PRT thing than a New Wave thing, but we’d done a small share.  Looking out for the recent triggers, putting our faces and names out there, staying in touch with the public.“A nurse sat down with me for a while,” she said.  “No offense, I appreciate it, but I’m kind of talked out.”“Instead of talking, um,” I said.  I showed her what was in my hand, letting the straps dangle.  “What would you say about going flying?”I saw her eyes go wide.“The hospital called your dad’s work.  He said it was okay.”⊙My feet left the hospital rooftop.  Flying was unwieldy, especially with my burden.  I was untrained.  Having the benefit of my forcefield to protect me in the event of a crash would mean having my forcefield up, and that had other connotations, with my power as distorted as it was, the fact that I couldn’t necessarily control the movements or know what they would do.  Not doable, when I held someone.There was uncertainty too.  The source of that flight, it had never let me down, but if push came to shove, in a crisis, would my maneuvering be sloppier?  Would I decelerate or accelerate in a different way?  I’d carelessly trusted my power, once, and now I wasn’t sure I could.  I knew what the source of that power was, now, and what its goals were.It was emotionally heavy, even as I felt almost weightless physically, to be reminded of what had changed so dramatically.I could feel my charge’s intake of breath, as I held one arm across her lower ribs.  I didn’t trust the harness we’d grabbed from the physio center.  Not enough to hold someone for me.  She was strapped with her back to my front.The ground was a good ways below us now.  I hadn’t even ascended that fast.  I’d been a little lost in thought.I felt her laugh, nervous and small, while I turned us around, giving her a view of the area.  Norfair and its community center was off in the distance, one way.  The farms were off in another direction.  From here, it was easy to see the tall buildings of the city, the places that looked like a slice of the old world.  To look to the fringes of those areas, where the tents and shoddily erected structures stretched off, so endless it seemed they reached to the horizon.“I got you,” I said, in answer to the nervous giggles.  Had I laughed like that, on my first real flight?“Yeah,” was the response, a small, quiet voice.  Then more giggles.The giggle became laughter on her part, borderline hysterical.“You okay?”She nodded, fast and fierce, then drew in a deep breath.“Wooooooooo!” she whooped, top of her lungs, loud enough to be heard on the ground.“Hood up,” I said, reaching up to tug the hood of her hoodie over her head.“What?  Why?” she asked, panting from the cheer.“Just in case it’s cold,” I said.“Cold?  Why-”Before she could fully catch her breath, I dropped from our position, diving, fast, hard, and surprising enough that even I felt my stomach’s contents lurch.She didn’t have the ability to cheer, as the drop stole what little breath she had, but her arms went up and out, to either side of my shoulders, fingers spreading to feel the wind, the sun-warmed air.I smiled, letting the swoop dash all of the other thoughts and feelings from my mind, vicariously enjoying the experience of flying for the first time.  Of flying at all.⊙“Juan?” I asked.Juan was younger than the other kids had been.  Eight, if I had to guess, but he wasn’t well, so that might have screwed up my estimation.  He was thin at the arm and wrist, and puffy around the face.“The first time I came to the hospital, one of the nurses wore that costume,” Juan said.  “He was a guy though.”“How does it look on me?” I asked.“I think it looks really nice,” he said.  “You’re very pretty.”“Thank you,” I said.  “That’s sweet.”“Some of the others were saying a lady superhero was going around taking people flying.”“Yeah,” I said.  “That’s the plan.  Your mom and dad said you might enjoy it, and you should be well enough.”“They had to go to work,” Juan said.“That’s what I heard.”“They always have to go.  Even when I have bad days.  And there’s nothing on television.  There’s only three channels and they’re real boring.”“Yeah,” I said.“I really hate hospitals,” he said.I took a deep breath.  His words echoed my feelings, which only magnified the feelings.Yeah.  I really hated hospitals too.“It’s getting dark,” I said, “But if you want to try flying, maybe that’d be a bit of a break from the boring stuff, and a break from the hospital.”“Thank you,” Juan said.  “But flying sounds like it’s very tiring.”“It can be,” I said.  “I can go slow if you like, or we can do something else.  We could talk.”He nodded at that last bit, then started looking around.  I pulled up a nearby chair, and sat down next to his bed.“I got a lot of books,” Juan said.  He deposited a stack of kids’ books and comics on the edge of the bed, between me and him.  “Uh, before.  I said I didn’t want to be stuck here and be bored, my mom went and came back with books and comics, and then they both left.”“That was nice of them,” I said.  I picked up one of the books.“My eyes are tired today,” he said.  “The letters are blurry.”“Do you want me to read some out loud?” I asked.That got me a firm nod, and the first smile I’d seen out of him.“Good Simon to start, then?” I asked.  Another nod.There were pictures, so he shuffled over to the edge of the bed, and I sat on the other side, my ass half on the bed’s railing, and I held the book between us, so we could both see it.Two good Simon books, which were most likely aimed at someone just a bit younger than Juan was, but he didn’t seem to complain.  I moved on to a comic involving the robot prison ship, peeking ahead so I could skip past the scenes which were aimed at someone much older than him, and then, to be safe, moved on to something aimed at a younger age again.  Kids in animal masks getting into trouble.There wasn’t much likelihood that Juan had powers, but he’d had a bad day, and this was okay.I was halfway through that book when I saw someone look in at the door, peeking around.  A boy.  He stopped as he spotted me.I finished the page, then paused, partially closing the book, and checking on Juan.  Fast asleep.  I checked his pulse, because I was paranoid, then fixed his blankets, and eased myself up off the bed with flight, to not disturb him.I used a notepad by the side of the bed, and wrote a brief farewell:Nice to meet you, Juan.  The nurses have my number so if you want to go flying sometime, we might be able to arrange something.  🙂



-VictoriaI walked over to the door.  It wasn’t one of the ones I’d taken a flight with.  Older, thirteen or so, with what might have been his first pimples.I saw the hesitation on his face.“Come on,” I said.  “Let’s go to the cafeteria.  It’s late, I don’t think many people will be around.”He nodded.⊙“Hello?”“Tempera?  Hi, it’s Victoria.  I’m sorry to call you so late.”“It’s fine.  I don’t sleep much, and the call is more than welcome.  Why the call?”“I’m at the hospital, talking to someone-”“You’re still at the hospital?”“Yes.  I’ve been talking to a teenager, he’s listening in on my half of the conversation right now.  He’s got a friend with powers, but she’s not doing so hot.  It’s new and it’s scary and neither he nor she know what to do.”“We’ve been there.”“We’ve been there.  Yeah.  I know you’re in touch with the Wardens.  They’re decent, they have a lot of resources, they have some good people.”“Absolutely.”“He can describe particulars and you can let them know.”“Not a problem.   Just so you know, it might be hard to get someone on the phone this late, but if it’s a problem, I know some people I can round up and we can go talk to her as a big supportive group.”“Great.  I’m going to hand you off now.”“Wait, one second.  Victoria.”“Yes?”“Call me back when this is over, or call me first thing in the morning.  I was sounding out some people, it’s not an invite to a team or anything, but with something this messy, we need all the hands we can get.”“Messy?”“I’ll explain later.  For now, we help your buddy there.”I handed the corded phone over.  We stood at an empty nurse’s station in a hallway where the lights had been set dim.  My hands were free, and I’d intentionally used their phone so my own would be free.There were other calls I needed to make, including one to Crystal to let her know where I was.  I put that one off.  Crystal was easygoing.I sent one to Mrs. Yamada.Me:



I know your caseload is full, but found a kid with some power-related troubles.  Contact is reaching out to Wardens soon.  Maybe you can keep an eye out to make sure all goes smooth?The boy was explaining in a hushed voice about his friend’s circumstance.  An uncontrolled, messy power, and she had no place to go.  He hadn’t given me many details, but I could tell he was scared, and I could infer from that that she must be terrified.The reply came back.Jessica:



Absolutely.  I can’t promise I take them as a patient but I can help with initial moves.



I nodded to myself.The boy was relaxing as he talked on the phone.  A distant, authoritative, kind voice, and the promise of some answers or help.My phone buzzed again.Jessica:



A patient canceled for later this week.  Do you want to meet for a late lunch?  There’s something I’d like to talk to you about.                                                                                              Flare – 2.3                                                                                             It was dark as the boy and I stepped outside.  It was a flipping of perspectives, in a way, that the city lights were going out and the tent villages off in the distance were lighting up with lamps and fires.  The city had only a small fraction of the light it might have had in the old world when power rationing wasn’t in effect, only a tenth the normal number of apartments were lit up.  Only the major roads had light, and that meant far less people were driving, which meant less head and tail lights.It was cool out, not as cold as it had been last night, thankfully.It was five minutes before Tempera met us at the door.  She looked a little worn out, but then again, she’d gone to the hospital, gone home, come back to the hospital, and she was juggling something with the messy situation she’d talked to me about.“Hi Victoria.  Hi Sam.”“Hi,” Sam said.“On a scale of one to ten, how serious is your friend’s situation?”“Uh.  Six?  She’s depressed, she’s scared, she doesn’t know how to use her power, and I can’t get near her to help her.  She’s afraid people are going to take her away.”“How immediate is the situation?  Does she need help in the next five minutes, next hour, today?  Is she or anyone else in danger?”“She’s alive, but I’d like to get her help soon.  She’s freaking out and I don’t know what to do.”“I’m only asking like this because it’s an emergency, and since our talk on the phone it’s escalating.  I’m going to take you to the Wardens headquarters, okay?  I’m going that way already, I can walk you through the security and introduce you to some people, and they’ll have ideas on what to do with your friend.  Sound good?”“Sounds alright.”“What’s the emergency?” I asked.“Citizen labor is going nuts.  They’re massing, pulling in some outside help, a lot of other angry and frustrated citizens.  I don’t have the full picture yet, but it’s all hands on deck.  Wardens are coordinating Advance Guard, Foresight, Shepherds, the Attendant and others.  They’re even bringing in the PRTCJ capes, which haven’t exactly been advertised to the public.”Crystal’s group.  The situation was bad enough to open the can of worms that was capes serving as a military-adjunct force?  In this climate, no less.Tempera went on, “I and some of the other prospective Wardens are being asked to go with the Wardens proper, to handle things where they’re getting out of control offworld.”“Offworld?”“I recommended you, said you’d help, they’ve given a tentative a-ok on that.  Things are expected to blow up when the city wakes up tomorrow, so it’s up to you if you want to help tonight or first thing tomorrow.  I sent you the address?”“I got it,” I said.“I should go.  Sam, with me.”“Good luck,” I said.  “Sorry to pass the ball like this.”“It’s fine.  Good luck to you too, Victoria.”I checked my phone, waiting painful minutes for sites to load.She’d said I could help tonight or tomorrow.  That things would get bad starting tomorrow.The news sites already had multiple headlines with the word ‘war’ followed by a question mark.  And things were expected to get worse tomorrow?No, I’d go tonight.I’d fly, even.  I messaged Crystal. ⊙I let myself into Crystal’s apartment through the balcony, using the key Crystal had given me on the sliding glass door.“I’m here,” I called out.I was about to step from the living room to the hallway when a red-tinted forcefield appeared across the path, blocking my way.“One moment!” Crystal called out.I turned my back to the forcefield and leaned against it, my arms folded.  “Can I talk to you from here?”“Yep!”“The headlines are saying war,” I said.  “And you’re being brought in.”“Could go that way,” Crystal said.  “It’s wonky.  Two sides are butting heads and we’ve got another world that’s pretty upset.”“I’ve only heard bits and pieces from some others and the news.  Is it a strike?”“Not a strike.  I’m dressed now, you can come through,” Crystal said.  The forcefield disappeared, and I used flight to keep from falling, turning myself around before walking down the hallway and around the bend to Crystal’s room.Crystal had already been in costume and with her group when she’d been ordered to get ready and be at the location within half an hour.  She was using the opportunity to help get me organized.  She’d showered while waiting for me, she’d donned her costume, and she was combing wet hair now.Her costume was white, with her usual symbol on it, the arrow pointing down and to the side, with a stream of lines flowing from the back of the arrow, over one shoulder.  She wore a jacket with it, a near-black gray, given a faint magenta-red tint.  ‘PRTCJ’ was printed on the back in big white letters.  A lone stylized chevron was on the sleeve.There were things to be said about it, about the militaristic tilt of the group, the way the PRT and the Protectorate had broken in such a way that the Wardens had sprung up from one large chunk of the image, presentation and ideals.  Crystal’s parahuman miltary thing was crudely forged from another chunk of what the PRT had been: the PRT’s old laws, rules, and discipline.  A military-esque force without a government to serve or a hard and fast system of law to back it up.But it was Crystal’s call.  Crystal’s thing.  I held my tongue.“My closet,” she said.  “Black trash bags.  Never throwing things away pays off.  It’s one of the sample batches.”The bags made the clothes easy to find, even in the jam-packed closet.  The contents were hidden within the trash bags, the hooks of the hangers poking up and through.  Crystal indicated the bed, and I laid them out, peeling the plastic back.  White costumes without icons or decoration, a variety of cuts and styles.It was a familiar range.  Back in the day, companies had periodically reached out to New Wave, wanting to pitch their product and get us to use them for our costuming.  Mom had handled those talks and periodically singled out a family member to send a bunch of proto-costumes to.  Later she would nag us for feedback that she could send the companies.I didn’t want to think about mom.I focused on the costumes, with some attention paid to the situation at hand.  The leotard cut was a ‘never ever’.  The full-body suit was problematic because of how it resembled Scion’s, and I didn’t want to go there.  Those were two I could eliminate right away.  I pulled the black trash bags down over them and set them aside.Crystal explained, “People have been noting how fast we got back on our feet, and how we have something reasonably stable in currency and economy.  We kind of got our answer.”“Yeah,” I said, before guessing, “powers?”“I guess powers, probably,” she said.I turned to look at Crystal.  She was arranging her damp hair over her eye, a curved swoop that her hairband held in place.  “Only probably?”“This isn’t about powers,” she said.  “But I wouldn’t rule them out.  They helped and they may be part of this.  The key thing is that a lot of the building materials and resources we used to get started came from other worlds.”“As in our people working in other worlds or-” I paused as Crystal shook her head.  “Or other, alternate civilizations.  Shit.  You don’t get anything of that scale for free.  What did we have to give them in exchange?”“I have no idea,” Crystal said.  “I don’t think many people do.  There are two major groups heading the reconstruction that might have an idea but they haven’t shared.  One of those groups was the one who put out the trading dollar a few months after Gold Morning, now our de-facto regular dollar.  Same group that’s now looking at moving up into the greater political arena.”“And those two groups are the ones butting heads?” I asked.“No, the two construction groups are banding together, kind of.  The workers who have been doing the actual construction work seem to think they were promised a significant discount and first opportunity to buy the houses they’ve been building.  They’ve been living in a tent village, working long weeks, miserable conditions.”“And if they think they have dibs on the houses, the work must have been a labor of love.  They’ll have a strong community too.  If they didn’t kill each other working that hard in conditions that bad, they must be close.”“Yes,” Crystal said.  “One second, be right back.”I glanced over the remaining outfits.  Three more options.  V-neck, long-sleeved, short skirt.  Not bad, but very reminiscent of ‘Glory Girl’.Round neck, low enough to have a touch of cleavage, short sleeves, and shorts that cut straight across the upper thigh.  If any length were taken from them at all, they wouldn’t qualify as shorts anymore.  Hard to pull off.  I’d need to accessorize it and I wasn’t sure I could afford the time to dig for boots, belt, or other stuff I’d need, and still get filled in.The last one had a high collar, a kind of truncated turtleneck, it was sleeveless, with leggings that ended in the mid-low calf.  Not bad but not great, and again, I’d need accessories.Urg.“The two construction groups are collaborating, banding together, the areas rezoned, contracts reworked.  They say workers signed and agreed, and there are no longer ‘dibs’, as you put it.”“For something that matters as much as home and shelter, with that many employees, you’d think someone would have read the contract thoroughly enough to figure that out.”“I have no idea,” Crystal said.“Sounds like someone’s not being honest.”“Again, Victoria, I don’t know,” Crystal said, sounding a little exasperated.  “I’m- we’re, if you’re coming, we’re not going there or being invited there to arbitrate or negotiate.  We’re not solving that particular problem.  We’re there to stand between the two sides, keep the peace.”I glanced at her jacket.  “Just following orders.”“Following orders, keeping things simple, letting others handle things,” Crystal said.  “Yeah.”I nodded.  “Okay.”I picked up the second costume, with the low neck, short sleeves, and short leggings, and held it up against my front.“Go for it,” she said.  “You definitely need to dress that up.”“I know,” I said.  “I’m going to go get changed and see if I can find footwear.  If you have a minute, could you find any belts?”“Utility or regular?”“Either or.  I like the idea of utility more, I think, for how I think I’ll be dressing up.”I stepped out of Crystal’s room, pulled the curtain closed by the balcony door and quickly stripped out of my top and the skirt.  I picked both up and put them with my other clothes.I experienced a brief moment of displaced emotion, as if my head and body were in Crystal’s apartment, and my heart was somewhere in the past.  In an exposed, open area that wasn’t mine, wasn’t comfortable, where someone could happen to step in and see me exposed at any moment.The latent feeling of the hospital room.  Of being in the care home.Pulling the costume on helped.  Deep breaths, the pull of the zipper as it closed at my back and pulled material tight against my chest and stomach.  I fixed the legs, checked for bunching and wrinkles, and deemed it satisfactory.  Not perfect in the way a costume made explicitly for me would be, but satisfactory.I dug in boxes.  I’d packed my things with shoes and boots at the bottom, clothes on top.“Belts,” Crystal said.  I heard the clatter as the things were tossed onto the couch.  “Masks.  Armband.”The bag rustled as it bounced off the couch and landed on the floor.  the armband landed on the couch near the belts.  A black band with the Gold Morning symbol on it.“Good throws,” I said.  Crystal was standing with her back to me.  She’d tossed them over her shoulder.  “You can turn around.”“Thank you,” she said.  “Don’t spend too much time.  It’s late, it’s dark, people won’t care too much.”“I won’t.  Where does the other Earth and the war fit into this?” I asked.  I pulled out a pair of white boots.  Shoes meant for a costume might have worked better, but I tended to prefer boots for the fact that they stayed on better with hard landings, kicks, and rough falls.  Fourteen year old Glory Girl had learned that lesson: it was terminally embarrassing to have a petty criminal watch as you flew over to your lost shoe and put it back on.“The workers called a stop to all work.  They’re holding the houses, equipment, and building materials hostage, with some suggestion they’ll destroy it all before they give up what they’re owed,” Crystal said.  “The last big convoy of materials and trucks were from another Earth, and they’re part of what’s being held hostage.  The delivery folk from Earth-K aren’t budging because they aren’t abandoning their delivery, even though they’ve been told they can go.  The government from United States of K is getting upset because their people aren’t home, That’s where the murmurings of war are coming from.  Workers aren’t conceding anything else, and construction groups aren’t either.”“And our job is to make sure the stalemate stays stale and mate until people find a resolution,” I said, pulling on the boots.“Or mitigate the damage if it gets ugly,” Crystal said.I did up the straps, reached for the belts, all arranged around a metal ring, and found one I was satisfied with almost right away.  Utility-belt style with small pouches.  I tore open the bag of masks.The masks were ones that were meant to be stuck to the face.  Remove protective tape, stick to face like cosmetic band-aids.  Not my favorite, but I got why they did it when they sent out sample packs.  The glue would wear out quickly, and the real custom masks for long-term wear would then be ordered.  Quality was fine, though.  All in white, again, some with lenses.I found one that fit around my eyes and covered my eyebrows, with white lenses, and held it up to make sure the white lenses didn’t obscure vision any.  A faint halo when I looked at sources of illumination, but nothing too bad.“What do you think?” I asked.“I think you look more like you than I’ve seen you in a long time,” she said.“Maybe I’m meant to wear a costume,” I said.“Maybe,” she said.  “But what I meant, cuz, is that from the moment you stepped into my bedroom, well before you put anything on, you looked more focused and grounded in reality than you have in a while.”I drew in a deep breath, and glanced at the curtains.  Being told I looked better reminded me that I hadn’t looked well before, which reminded me of why I hadn’t looked well, which in turn made me feel less better.It was easier if I didn’t focus on it.  “Thanks, I guess.”“Whatever you were doing, I think you should do more of it.”“I plan to.  But for now, in the interest of time, since your formation is expecting you to hurry back, I just need to know if the mask makes me look like a dork.”“It’s good,” Crystal said.  She picked up one article of clothing that I’d put aside while digging for my boots.  A plain white sweatshirt.  “To cover up the road rash?”I looked at my arms.  I still had the raised red marks where I’d tumbled to the road.“Or maybe not.  It wouldn’t work with your forcefield,” she said.It would, but I wasn’t about to explain that whole situation.“No, actually, it could work,” I said.  “Dress up the upper body some.”She smiled, enthusiastic that I was playing along.  “Exactly!  I was thinking we could stick a quick heat-transfer design on this.”The sweatshirt as part of my costume?  It would be playing into that trend of working normal clothes into costumes.  Fume Hood’s group had been big on that.  A few of the villains in Lord of Loss’ group had, too, but some of that might have been them trying to fly under the radar before launching their plan.The most significant trends in fashion and style were often a symptom of external factors.  It was hard to get good costumes with where things were at.  There was a desire, too, to appear more down to earth, to connect to the people, when sentiment was where it was at.“Sure,” I said.  I smiled.  “That could work.”“Question is, do you trust me to do it?” she asked, raising one hand and producing a fan of lasers from her fingertips, shooting at a forcefield she’d created.  “Or do you want to wait for the iron to get hot?”⊙The battle lines were drawn, so to speak.  At least it was quiet here, the forces gathering in anticipation of the coming day.  At the center of this particular battlefield was a single tall building, lit from bottom floor to top, even in the evening, with the power rationing being what it was.The masses of construction workers had clustered in groups, the largest mass of them arranged around three sides of the building, kept on the far side of the street by the emergency services and the capes.  Surrounding one of the construction company’s headquarters.Lights on poles, the lighting of the news crews talking to some key individuals, and the lights the workers were carrying served to illuminate that crowd.From the bird’s eye view, we could see some of the construction sites around the area, each roughly illuminated by the lights within, that light contained by the fencing that surrounded each building in progress.  Construction vehicles, people, and collections of things cast long shadows with the lights set where they were.  Most had lookouts posted, keeping an eye out for trouble.  A couple of those lookouts turned lights our way as we flew.Laserdream and I touched ground.“I’ve missed flying with you,” she said.I smiled.  My emotions were complicated enough in the moment that I didn’t want to say anything.  I didn’t trust my tone of voice or the words I might choose.Easier to stick to the shallow, surface response.  It was nice to be around my cousin, nice that she was happy.We walked down the length of the street, the building on one side, the crowd of workers on the other.  Walking helped to get my blood pumping and my body warmed up, where flying felt like it had frozen my blood and chilled me.  My hands were cold, and I kept them jammed in the pockets of my sweatshirt.“Laserdream.  You’re cutting it close in getting back in a timely manner.  Who’s this?” a cape in a jacket asked.  He was a heavy guy with a very clean face, a gently curved visor covering his eyes and nose.“Family,” Laserdream said.  “There was a call for more help, she was invited by someone named, uh…”“Tempera,” I said.“Tempera.  Right.  We’re paying for the extra hands on deck?”“We are,” the man said.  “It’s not a lot.”“That’s fine,” I said.He looked skeptical.“I can second the recommendation if it matters,” Laserdream said.“It helps,” the guy said.  “If she causes trouble, you know it’s your ass in the fire.”“Understood, sir,” she said.  “I’ve been doing patrols with her since before I could drive.  I’d trust her with my life.  I’m optimistic my ass will remain room temperature.”“Don’t get smart.  I don’t want her with the formation.  If she wants in, she needs to apply and train.”“She doesn’t-” Laserdream said, at the same time I said, “I don’t-”Laserdream ceded to me.“No disrespect intended,” I said.  “That isn’t for me.  But I get the gist of the situation, I’ll help keep the peace, I’ll follow any orders.”“You going to be alright if I send you out to help fill in the gaps at the flanks?”“It’s why I’m here,” I said.“South side of the building,” he said, pointing.  “Stand on the dotted line, try not to stare down the crowd or antagonize them.  Be gentle if they get rowdy.”“Can do,” I said.“Should be quiet tonight,” he said.  He turned to Laserdream as he said it, but glanced at me.  Including us both in the statement.  “This is one of three locations.  The big demonstrations are supposed to start tomorrow, at another location.  Tonight they’re mainly interested in holding their ground and organizing themselves.  Holding a vigil, giving cameras something to record.  Would be nice if they got over it or got bored before things get started tomorrow, but I don’t think that’s going to happen.”That would be why Tempera had said I could call in the morning.  The workers wanted time and media attention to give their side some weight before they really took action.“Get yourself in position.  I’ll send someone your way with some cups of coffee in a short while.”“Alright,” I said.The parahumans along the road to the south of the building were spaced out along the painted divider in the center of the street.  One parahuman every fifteen or so feet.  There were no barricades, only the lights on tripods, connected to battery packs, helping to illuminate most of the road.  The ambient light from nearby buildings contributed.The crowd was noisy, but it was a low, constant noise.  Talk, conversation, the occasional raised voice.  There wasn’t a car to be seen on the street.I could remember what had happened to Fume Hood.  I closed my eyes for a moment, and I put my forcefield up, leaving it up.  It made me uncomfortable, but a bullet would be even worse on that score.The capes down the street to my left were all wearing Advance Guard icons on their sleeves and costumes.  The stylized man bearing the ‘greater-than’ shaped shield, charging forward.  The color of the icon changed, depending on the costume’s color scheme, but it was always such that it stood out, yellow on a red and orange costume, or purple on a blue-green one.  The thick bold lines of the icon’s design tended to flow into the cape’s individual icon or the rest of the costume, the shield’s lines or the diamond-shaped frame of the icon joining the line running down the seam of the sleeve or the lines running across the chest.“Who are you with?” the guy standing to my left asked.  He had a face plate, with the thick bold lines and angular edges that Advance Guard tended to have, and the ‘ears’ of the plate swept back to cover his ears, giving them a pointed, elfin cast.  His bodysuit was designed to accent his slim frame, a two -piece jacket and legging combo, with a very pronounced zig-zag at the waist where the upper body met the lower body.  There was a slight curl at the toes.“I’m independent,” I said.  “For now.”“We’re Advance Guard,” he said.  “I’m Spright.”“I’m between names,” I said.  “And between costumes.  Don’t judge me too harshly.”“Can I see the emblem?”“Just a design, not an emblem,” I said, turning my back to him to show him the rush job we’d managed with the heat-transferred image, my sweatshirt lightly singed in places.  It was a circle with lines intersecting it, almost like a sun, but with the lines running into the circle.  The image was offset, so the lines were shorter to the left and top of the image.  Crystal’s idea and design, and I’d had no objection.“Between teams, between names, between costumes?”“More or less sums it up,” I said.  “If you need to call me anything, you can call me Victoria.”“I’m honored, Victoria,” Spright said, bowing slightly.  “I’m glad for the company.  We might be here for a while.”“We probably will,” I said.“I see you’ve got the armband.  You’ve been around for at least a few years. Do you have any war stories you can share?”“Yes, a good few,” I said.  And a lot I wouldn’t share.“You’re experienced, huh?”“A few years under my belt.  A few years of semi-retirement.”“I can tell you I’m very experienced,” he said, with a bit of humor in his voice.I looked at him, one eyebrow arched.“I’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours,” he said.“Is that how we’re doing this?”“Could be,” he said.  “What I’m offering is long and thoroughly satisfying.  Are you game?”“Wow,” I said.  I smiled despite myself, looking over the crowd instead of at Spright.  “When they said Advance Guard rushes into things, they weren’t lying.”“Once you get me going, I go all night.  I might as well get started early.”“With an audience, though?”“I’ve got nothing to hide.  I’d say they could join in, but I think that would get a little hectic.”“It might just,” I said.  “Would be nice to steer clear of hectic for a while.”“I very much agree, Victoria Between-things,” Spright said.  “You have to find a good fit, strike the right rhythm, the right pace.  Once you’re comfortable, you might be able to vary it up some.”The woman standing to the left of Spright said something that sounded an awful lot like, “Oh my god, Spright.”I checked, but it didn’t look like the people on the sidewalk heard us.  The buzz of conversation seemed to drown out our voices.“Is he always like this?” I asked, raising my voice a bit.“Yes,” Spright said.“No,” she said.  “I dare say you’ve inspired him.  Unfortunately.”Spright sounded almost energized by his teammate’s exasperation.  “I’m intrigued more than inspired.  I’d love to indulge in your, ahem, stories, Victoria with the stylish icon.”“It’s not that great an icon,” I said.  “Nice try, though.  I appreciate it.”“I wanted to work in the flattery somehow.  There’s no shortage of things I could say, by the way, and I’m not messing around when I say that.  I chose the icon because I do like it, and because when you say something nice about something like a girl’s hair or something else about their appearance, you tend to get that kneejerk resistance.”“You do,” I said.  For me, it’s for reasons other than the usual.  It was a shame, but his moment of frankness had brought things home again.  My tone of voice was audibly different even to myself as I said, “I’m flattered, Spright, really.”“Aw darn.  But?”“But while I’d be happy to share a few stories, I’m not up for the other stuff you’re driving for.  It’s just not where I’m at.  Wouldn’t be fair to you.  I’ve gotta figure myself out some, first.”“I can respect that,” he said.“Thank you,” I said.  “I appreciate the wit.  You were pretty snappy with some of that.”“Thanks for letting me try, I-” Spright stopped as the woman standing to his left made a sound effect with her mouth.  I didn’t hear the preceding sound, but I heard her make a sound like a small crash with her mouth.  Spright switched tacks to say, “I’ll throw things at you, Tandem.”The woman laughed.A moment later, another person joined us.  A ripple in the road, and he appeared almost instantly out of the gloom.  The cape I’d met early in the day the community center had been attacked, with the blades jutting from his costume.He looked at me, sizing me up.“Hi,” I said.“Mmh,” he made a sound, not really a response.  “Hey, Spright, swap places with me for a bit.”The ‘mmh’ bugged me.  “I’m enjoying his company.”“She’s enjoying my company, Shortcut,” Spright said.  “It’s a good night.”“It’s going to be a long night,” Shortcut said.  “I think I know her from the other day.”He paused, glancing back at me.“Yeah,” I said.Shortcut turned back to talk to Spright, then paused, glancing back at me.  “What’s that sound?”I listened, and I heard it.  Scratching.Without trying to look too much like I was looking down, I looked down.  My forcefield, invisible to everyone present, was scratching at the road.I took flight, lifting myself up enough that the arms couldn’t reach the ground.  About eight feet up.  From the angle, as I saw the light hit the road at a different angle, I could see the shallow gouges.The good humor from earlier was spoiled a little at that.“Everything okay?” Spright asked.“Yeah, just restless, bit of power quirkery,” I said.  I realized the crowd had noticed me take flight, and the conversation had quieted a bit.It was mildly surprising that, Spright’s flirting aside, nobody in a large collection of construction employees had called out to me.I tested my luck, and used the opportunity to call out, “You guys doing okay!?”“Bit cool out!” someone called back.“Yeah!” I called back.  “Better than the alternative, isn’t it?”That got me a fairly mixed response.“Shoulder to shoulder in the heat, stinking of sweat?  You don’t want that!”“We’re used to the smell of sweat, hon!” a woman called out.  There were murmurs of agreement.“Take care of yourselves, okay?”There were a few murmured and unintelligible responses, but a more emotional cry of, “Give us our homes and we’ll be just fucking fine!” stood out.  Some heads turned in that direction.“It’s not up to us,” I said.  “Save that energy for tomorrow, alright?  We’re here to keep you safe and keep them safe.”There were a few mumbled replies.“Doesn’t help,” Shortcut said.“I dunno,” I said.  “Letting them know we’re not against them, we care about their well being?  Reaching out and talking can’t hurt, can it?”“I guess that’s why I’m here,” Shortcut said.I looked his way.“Reaching out and talking,” he said.  “I just wanted to make sure there’s no hard feelings.”“About you not getting into Advance Guard.”I’d emailed, they’d sent a reply a couple of hours later saying no.“I didn’t devote a lot of thought to it,” I said.  “Sucks, but you guys have to do what you have to do.  And so does everyone else, apparently.  I’ll figure something out.”“They didn’t tell you it was me?”“No,” I said.  I frowned.“I told them to tell you no and to tell you it was me, and why.”“Alright,” I said.  “They just told me no.”“Well fuck that.  I thought you needed to know, what you did back there, it was shitty.”“Beg pardon?”“I realized after your face came up on some of the events about the Norfair community center incident.  You went up against Lord of Loss?”“I don’t see what the issue is,” I said.“You happen to beat me to the scene, and then you use your secret identity, condescension and anti-parahuman shit to take me down a notch?  And then you want a place on Advance Guard?”“I happened to be there.  I’m sorry, it was not my intention to come across that way.”  I tried to help you out some.“Yeah,” he said.  “Right.  I can guess what your intentions were.”I was pretty darn confident my handling of the situation had been alright.  I was inclined to chalk this one up to the guy having a screw loose or a few bundled up issues.  It still bothered me, and it bothered me more that a nice conversation had been interrupted, and now this guy was apparently intent on keeping me company for the night, telling me how I was responsible for his problems and issues.I pursed my lips, doing my best to filter what he was saying, tuning out what I could and responding where necessary, so he wouldn’t add me ignoring him to his list of grievances.  He was talking about the community center now.Voices were raised, a few shouts, both from capes at one of the other streets, and by people in the crowd.  Phones were out.It was almost a welcome interruption, in that solitary moment between the initial commotion and when I realized that it meant people were hurt.I rotated myself in the air, looking, trying to figure out what had happened.  I saw Crystal coming, and flew to meet her.“Come!” she shouted, barely pausing as she flew.  I joined her, wavering as air ripped past my forcefield, lopsided in a way I couldn’t quite detect, moving.I disabled the forcefield, and in the doing, I could fly straighter, but I flew against cold wind, unprotected.Crystal didn’t explain.  It was left for me to see.Our site had been quiet.  At least one of the other places workers were congregating wasn’t.  People were more spread out, and I suspected from their arrangement that some had crossed the street, approaching the building.  There were more emergency vehicles, more capes, and there was a large clearing in the center of the crowd.Eight people were gathered toward the center of that clearing, with more scattered across the more open area.  Among them, several had eyes that glowed, or glows emanating from their mouths.  Shapes I couldn’t quite make out moved around them.  A power at work, like the outline of something that glowed slightly in the dark, too abstract to make out.I watched as two people broke from the edge of the clearing and ran toward the center group.  A man and a woman, holding hands.It hit me like a blow to the head.  An image in my mind’s eye, a feeling, a sense of something greater.  Forgotten in the same instant it occurred.  I dropped out of the air, and I caught myself a moment later.  Crystal did much the same.“Get back!” someone hollered.A megaphone blared, “Get away from the center!”The eight people were sixteen now, including the two that had run toward the center and some of the people that hadn’t retreated to the clearing’s edge.  Eyes glowed, powers wreathed a few hands.  A spike of power-generated material was stabbing skyward in front of a woman.  A man had fallen to his knees, arms spread, and the ground was rippling around them.People didn’t get away from the center.  Realizing what was happening, or thinking they knew what was happening, others dashed toward the group, joining it.“Get back,” Crystal said.  “If we get knocked out-”I retreated, looking for where the defending capes were.  Lit by flashing, noiseless sirens, the capes were clustered not far from the building.  They were getting organized.“It’s a broken trigger,” I said.“Is it?” Crystal asked.I flew straight for the heroes on scene.  I didn’t get the chance to hear two words out of the leader’s mouth before we were hit again.  Every one of us winced and reacted as it hit us.  Too brief to be a trigger vision, incomplete, fractured, it still made itself felt.The sixteen had become thirty-two.                                                                                             Flare – 2.4                                                                                             “Evacuate!”One word from the parahuman in charge was all we needed.  The clock was too short for anything more.Capes fanned out, most of them on foot.  I could leave the parts of the crowd closest to us to them.  I flew, avoiding the sky directly over the group of affected people, circling around the periphery instead.  The wind was cold against my face and legs.The massed crowd of citizen workers was to my right, the people with powers to my left.  Half of the light sources in and around the clearing had broken, and the only other illumination came from the effects of powers.  A common thread ran through all of it.  Energy spilled out and created matter where it splattered on the road, materials sprouted from nothing, streaked with thin streams of liquid that glowed like fire, and more abstract growths formed suspended in air, their images sticking to the backs of my eyes like the persistent afterimages of sparklers waved in the dark.People were shouting.  Some were screaming.  I couldn’t make much of it out.I flew to the far side of the clearing, which also happened to have some of the thickest gatherings of people.  They had been citizen laborers, gathering to make their displeasure known to the construction groups.  They’d been facing the building until the incident, they’d backed up, and there were places where the presence of buildings and parked vehicles made it so they had no place to retreat, leaving them now packed together, shoulder to shoulder, front to back, jostling.I’d helped to evacuate before.  I had attended the Leviathan attack on my hometown.  I had been around for the majority of the Slaughterhouse Nine crisis.  I’d participated in other, minor incidents, helping with fires and storms, though those had mostly involved helping the elderly and standing around.The truism was that in a disaster, people were their own worst enemies.Never this bad.I’d never seen or imagined a situation where people would do the opposite of evacuating, throwing themselves headlong into the hazard.  They thought the people in the center of the clearing were getting powers, and people were breaking away from the crowd at the clearing’s edge to run toward the affected individuals.Crystal created a wall to block off a street as she passed it.  She wouldn’t be able to keep it up as she got further away, but it bought time for others to get there.She raked a laser across the road, a bright and noticeable  distraction, to give people pause.I dropped to the street, using a pulse of my aura to get people’s attention.  Some stopped to look, while others ducked low, as if instinct drove them to shy away from the perceived threat.“Run!” I shouted, using my aura to play up my words.  “Other way!”I saw eyes widen, and turned to look.  A man had opened his mouth, and had something that looked almost as tall and thick as a telephone pole spearing skyward from his mouth.  Blood streamed from the sides of his mouth, his jaw clearly dislocated, and more fluids painted the length of the pole as it continued to rise.  It reached its maximum height, and then forked, the upper half splitting out into two equally thick portions, a giant ‘Y’ shape.  Each branch then forked into two, and forked into two again.“Go,” I said, sparing only a momentary glance for the people I’d been stopping.  I saw them start to run away.The man reached up, his fingers dragging along the blood-slick shaft of the trunk of the fractal tree he had vomited up.  Each movement of his hands was slower and weaker than the last.I flew toward him, to do what I could to help, even though I wasn’t sure what that could possibly be.The ‘tree’ toppled, and it was only because I was already on my way toward him that I was able to intervene.  I reached out for the falling tree, and my power was quicker to touch it.  Phantom fingers bit into the surface, fracturing the chalky material.  With flight, my bare hands, my power, and my aura pushed out to give people a little more incentive to get out of the way, I controlled the tree’s fall.  It broke into chunks on contact with the ground.  One of the people with new powers was pinned beneath branches, but it didn’t look like he was hurt by the contact.I flew to the man who’d grown the tree.  Even before I reached his side, I could see the damage that had been done.  Jaw, throat, chest, and stomach had been torn away.  Traces of the same material that had formed the tree had collected in his insides and pelvis, breaking into jagged pieces at some point before or during the tree’s fall.He had no throat to feel for a pulse.  I wasn’t about to rule anything out, even as I saw the remains of his heart in his splayed-out chest cavity.  I pried one of his eyes open, and I saw no response.I went from a crouch to airborne in a second.That particular disaster had been dramatic and visible for a significant portion of the people nearby.  Most were thinking twice about running toward the epicenter.When was the next wave coming?  The number of people to trigger all at once had seemed to double the last time.  They didn’t look like multi-triggers either.  One power each, some self-destructive.  I could hear the screams and shouts of a lot of unhappy people and I couldn’t see one person who looked particularly happy about their new ability.I flew to a new location, looking to see where I could get the most people away.  The tree had done my work for me in one spot, Laserdream was standing at the intersection of two streets and walling them off with red-tinted, translucent fields.I saw another group- people were pulling away from the crowd, which was actively trying to grab them and hold them back.  Young people – older teenagers and twenty-somethings, that might have been a group of friends.  Seven of them.I shouted, but my voice was drowned out by the dentist-drill scream of a power somewhere nearby, by the hollers, the warnings, a dull explosion.I used my aura again.  Several people in the group stumbled, so caught up in reacting to my aura that they lost track of where they were going or how to put one foot in front of the other.  Several others paused, helping their friends that had tripped, stopped, or fallen.  The people at the edge of the crowd reacted too, pulling back away from me.I’d hoped more of them would stop shouting and screaming.  The affected people and the people at the edge of the clearing were making so much noise that it nearly drowned me out as I shouted, “Get back!”A number of people listened.  The crowd in particular was inclined to take my order, getting away from the scene.  Two of the seven who’d lagged behind the others turned to go too.Five, however, looked at me and then continued to run toward the scene.I clenched my fist.Rationally, I knew that they likely saw this as the simplest thing in the world.  The people over there had powers; all they had to do to get powers was to head over there.  Some might well have no idea what triggers were, or they might have bought into one of the various other theories out there, some intentionally obscuring the truth.  They didn’t know better.Well, the screaming should have given them pause, but that might have been balanced out by the fact that they felt especially powerless at this time in particular.  Because we were only two years after the most catastrophic and traumatic loss of human life in history.  Because as much as we were recovering, we were far from being where we’d been.  We weren’t okay.  The dispute between the citizen workers and the construction administrations only brought that home.Rationally, I knew that.Less rationally, I had a weak point that extended well before the Gold Morning, well before the hospital stay, well before the Slaughterhouse Nine, before the bad days against Empire Eighty-Eight, before my trigger, even.  I’d spent a fair portion of my time post-trigger and especially in the hospital, thinking about it.I couldn’t fucking stand being ignored.I flew to intercept.I hadn’t practiced with this power enough.  Even using it was a hard reminder, with a mental and emotional cost.  I knew I needed to come to terms with it, and my time at the hospital had been an early foray into that.That had been flight, and my flight was more or less untouched.I flew low, approaching a car.  As with the tree, all of my powers were up and active as I reached out in the car’s direction.  Phantom hands dug into the metal of the car’s body, invisible fingers stabbing through.  A mass of something pressed down on the hood, caving it in.If I had any control over those limbs, it wasn’t something that lent itself to fine touches.  It didn’t work well with the careful, methodical, warrior monk approach.  In this, in the instinct and the moment of frustration, I could only hope that what I wanted and what my power wanted were mostly in agreement.I glanced up to make sure Laserdream wasn’t watching.  I was close enough for my fingertips to brush the car’s paint as I swept my arm to one side, the holes and dents in the car twisting or opening wider as the phantom grip adjusted.  The- the other Victoria, the phantom Victoria that had never left the hospital, the wretch, threw the car.I canceled my power momentarily, to force it to release its hold, so it wouldn’t fling the car into the people I was trying to stop.  I let it reactivate a half-second later, flying forward in the car’s direction.  My defenses were up and sufficient to let me adjust the car’s trajectory with a sharp kick to the side.  Just to be safe.It crashed into a parked car, upside down, its roof and windows shearing into the top of the other.  A loud impact, metal scraping metal, a dozen windows on the two vehicles breaking.  It was raucous, chaotic, sudden and surprising, in a stark contrast to the massive, enduring weight that seemed to settle in me.Harder than flying.  I could tell myself I was helping people, keeping them clear of danger, and it helped much as it had with the flying, but it was still hard.The fact that a car had flown into another car twenty feet in front of them was enough to stop them in their tracks.  I had their full attention now.“Get away!  It’s dangerous!”Some backed away, then ran.  Two backed off but didn’t run.  The last of them was a man about my age, who stepped closer to the cars, intent on climbing over them.“Get away!”I was prepared to grab him as he climbed onto the underside of the car I’d thrown.  He continued to ignore me, finding his balance, stepping forward-The fragment of a trigger vision hit me.  The latest wave.I saw only a flash of faces, and in seeing those faces, I saw the phantom self that clung to me.  The impression lingered for only a moment before I realized the faces didn’t resemble mine.The man had been springing forward from the car to the ground when the event had hit.  I saw his legs swing forward, while his head remained in place.  He dangled, suspended in the air.I picked myself up off the ground, flying to him.Gone already.  No pulse, no light behind the eyes.  He made a faint gurgling sound, but it was some biological process or symptom of what had happened, not a sign of life.  He was pissing himself and shitting himself in death.He dropped out of the air, and I caught him.  It hardly mattered, he was gone, but it didn’t feel right to just let him fall.  I eased him to the ground.“Please help!” I heard a guy shout, amid renewed and nearby whimpers and sobs.I flew.  The two who had drawn back but hadn’t run- a boy and a girl.  The boy was holding the girl, while she strove to stay on her tiptoes.  Her face was turned skyward.I flew to them, and I caught her, helping to hold her.“Hold her steady!” the guy shouted.I held her as steady as I could.Another suspension?“My neck!” the victim shrieked the words.  A single glowing vein stood out on each arm, and glows on her legs suggested more of the same, but she barely seemed to care about it.  Clear fluid was streaming from her nose, thinner than snot, with needle-thin streams of blood joining it.“We got you,” I said.  “We’re here, we’ll support you.  Stay calm.”“I can’t move my head!” she cried out.  “Every time- my neck!”“Don’t try,” I said.  The guy was looking to me for help, and I wasn’t sure what to say or do.“My head hurts,” she said, sounding very far away.  Her words dissolved into a stream of whimpers and cries of ‘ow’.I was supporting her weight, but it wasn’t easy to do it from a strength perspective with my feet on the ground, and it wasn’t easy to stay steady while flying.“Laserdream!” I shouted the words, top of my lungs.“Headache,” the victim said, her eyes wide.  “My brain.”The guy looked at me again.  This time I didn’t try to hide my expression.  I knew I looked grim.Her brain.  The Corona Pollentia, the means by which powers were operated by the parahuman.  Hers had been established, but not as a fluid, functional thing.  It was a nail, taking her brain and fixing it to a specific position in reality.Laserdream appeared beside me.“What happened?” she asked.“Give her something to stand on,” I said.  “She’s stuck.”The forcefield appeared below.  The girl no longer had to stand on her tiptoes.“People are evacuating more now,” Laserdream said.  “We need to handle the people toward the center.  The waves are random.”I turned, looking at the guy.  “Do you know her?”“Not really.”“Can you run?  Go tell people to get away, as fast as they can.  This is bad.”“You don’t want to get caught in it,” Laserdream said.The guy nodded.“Bye Anne,” he said.  He let go of the girl, transitioning the grip entirely to me, then turned to run.Anne.She was making small sounds, guttural.  One hand came up to touch the side of my face and my hair, clumsy, as if she didn’t have full use of her fingers.One pat.“I’m sorry Anne,” I said.She made another of the gurgling sounds.  She was vomiting, I realized, and with her face fixed in a skyward position, there wasn’t anything I could do.  Anything I did to move her would add to the damage to her brain.I hugged her, hard.  After a moment, I felt her hug me back, clumsy but fierce.It was only a moment later that she started to convulse, whole-body.  I moved to try to seize her head and keep it from moving- a second too late.  One wrenching, forced movement of her head and upper body, and the nail ripped through a good share of the material in its vicinity.I caught her as she fell, and laid her out on the ground, placing her on her side.“We need to help others, Victoria.”“Yeah.”Spooky, to take to the air again.  I’d seen the numbers of people affected double, roughly, and this was another doubling, to look at it.  More artificial sources of light had broken, as space folded in areas, as things grew to obscure them, or as tendrils of energy lashed out like living things, distorting geography with each impact.Matter creation, matter manipulation, matter distortion.Over fifty people, if I had to guess.  It could well have been sixty-four.  They were too spread out for me to effectively ballpark.  Many might well have died from their power expression or the ‘nailing down’ of the brain.There was no being polite, now.  One person hesitating at what could have been the edge of the affected area.  I didn’t even pause as I grabbed him by the wrist, picking him up off the ground, dragging him with me, me barely six feet above the ground, him with toes and shoes scraping the road’s surface.  I didn’t want the fall to be too rough if I was knocked out of the air again.I half-deposited, half-threw him toward the crowd that still lingered.  I pointed at the largest guy present.  “You.  Make sure these people get away!  Keep an eye on this one!”He looked spooked, and I wasn’t even using my aura.  He gave me a singular nod.Another two, two men together.  One of them fought me as I held him, trying to pry my hand free.“Assholes!” he screamed, twisting my fingers, trying to get leverage to bend one backward.  “Keeping powers to yourselves!”I didn’t reply.  I tightened my grip to keep him from getting any one of my fingers, and I saved my breath and my focus.If this was turning out as badly as it looked like it was, the aftermath would be answer enough.The guy who’d fought me was deposited beside the first vehicle with flashing lights that was waiting at the edges.  A fire truck.“Don’t let him go back!  And try to get further away, in case it expands!”I was already leaving before they could answer me.  I heard the shouts, though.  The answers.Crystal wasn’t using lasers or forcefields much anymore.  Only flight, only manhandling.I delivered two more armfuls of cargo, getting people clear of the danger.  On my return trip, I saw the geography transforming.  A culmination of everything up to this point.  From matter generation, matter distortion, and matter transformation to… something that made the entire area look as though it was being smudged and smeared around, streets widening, buildings pulling back from the street.Except- no.  No, this was a familiar smudging and smearing.  One that worked with us.You made it, little V, I thought.  I felt emotionally numb from the series of events, the deaths I’d seen, my momentary use of my power and how the feelings I’d tapped in that moment weren’t easy to bring back into order.There was only what needed to be done, the mission that stood front and center.  It was difficult to execute effectively, but simple in how Glory Girl, Victoria, the phantom wretch and the capes I was working with could all agree it should be done.Get people clear.  Get them safe.A woman screamed words that barely strung together, the heel of one hand pressed to her forehead.  The other was pointed forward.  She shot something that was only visible by the way light refracted at its edges.  The projectile hit the ground, carrying forward like a cartoon mole and the elongated, humped trail of dirt it left in its wake.  Unlike the mole, the hump was jagged, folded earth.  Road folded up like complex origami.  She was pinning people down, keeping them from exiting a building.In the words I could make out, she wanted them to come help her, and in her actions she drove them away.“Stop!” I shouted to her.She shot one projectile at me.  Barely visible, it cut through the air, wind shrieking.I didn’t want to kill her, and if her hand at her head was any clue that she was in similar straits to Anne and the other man, a light push could do horrendous damage.I drew closer to the ground, defenses up.Work with me, I told my power.  My agent.  My flight wobbled as I experienced the lopsided drag of a hand reaching down at one side, clawing at the ground as I passed it.It didn’t create nearly enough debris.I changed angles.  I flew for the hump of origami road, two feet across, two feet tall, jagged and menacing.I passed within a few feet of it, and let my forcefield hit it.The hump of ground shattered explosively, blades of road cutting at my legs.  But it did create a cloud of dust and debris.She shot at me, and I reversed direction, passing the hump again, striking it.The two passes created enough of a mess to block the view.  I flew to the people the origami road woman had pinned down.  “Go, go, go!”I stood by with my defenses up, positioned to intercept any incoming projectiles.  They took the chance to run for it.This whole thing was a clusterfuck.  How many people were caught?  How many were acting irrational?  What options did we have?  What the hell was I supposed to do?The origami woman didn’t send any attacks through the cloud of shattered road that I’d created.  The moment the group was out of sight and away, I was moving again.A complete and total clusterfuck.  I flew high, and I looked down, wishing we had more light on the scene.I could see where the distortions were being utilized.  The space between the people at the edges and the center of the effect was being extended, making the clearing larger.  It made it harder for people to approach, carried fleeing people away.  It meant the effect had to reach further if it wanted to catch anyone.In the tension and the emotions that gripped me, I felt an isolated point of peace and calm I could grab onto.Vista was here, Vista had made it through Gold Morning.  She was one of the people I liked.  A reason I was doing what I did.  She was one of the good ones, she was doing good work here, and I wanted to help her on multiple levels.In that line of thinking, I found both the focus to think beyond mere instinct, and to realize what I could do.  I knew how Vista worked.“It’s Vista,” Laserdream said.  She’d appeared beside me again.  She had a flying cape with her.“Come on,” I said.  I flew for where the expansion of space seemed weakest, even pinched.They weren’t on the streets.  It was people in buildings.I tore through a door, flew through a house.  Nothing.  I bumped into Laserdream and her PRTCJ friend on the way out.  “Search the buildings.  Vista’s power is weakest when it has people in its area.  There are people near here.”We spread out.  One building each, searching neighboring houses.  I was midway through my search when I heard a whistle.I flew to the sound.  Vagrants, or just refugees from Gimel who had decided they’d be more comfortable squatting in unoccupied, recently built houses than they were in the tent cities.The three of us carried them clear.  We were delivering them to safety when the next pulse hit.  We weren’t hit, but I could see a glowing figure in the sky flicker and drop briefly before they caught themselves.We took to the sky again, looking for pinched areas where things hadn’t distorted enough.  There were two spots, and both were already being addressed.The area was clear.  We found our way to where the Warden-affiliated capes had collected.  They had gathered at the edge of the effect.“I think we’re clear, Rocketround, sir,” Laserdream reported.“We should be shortly,” the leader said, glancing at a Foresight cape who stood nearby.“Yes sir,” the cape said.  A girl with a hood and blindfold.“How many?” Rocketround asked.“Ninety two, if you include the ones in houses,” she said.Rocketround paused, staring down the length of the road toward the center of the vastly extended clearing.  He spat.  When he spoke, he managed a tone that pretty perfectly encapsulated what I and probably most of us were feeling, “Fuck me.”Ninety two.  Ninety two, many like Anne.  Many wanting help.  I wanted to fly in, to do something.“I want everyone clear of the area.  We wait, we see what happens,” he said.  “We see if it expands in reach with further pulses, but I don’t want to give it anything.  Not even any bounceback from reaching out and finding some of us.  Let me know when the next pulse happens.”“Yes sir,” the blindfolded girl said.Something in the distance crashed to ground.  Another fixture like the fractal tree?Laserdream approached me, and she put an arm around me.  I did the same for her.There was small talk, people remarking on what they’d seen.  Horrible things.  People buried alive by their own powers.  A few cases like what I’d observed.“Is Vista around?” I asked.  “That was her, right?”I hadn’t expected Rocketround to be the one to answer, but he was the one who spoke up, saying, “She is.  Upstairs, top floor.  She said she needed a view and no interruptions.”No interruptions.  I was disappointed.“Who’s she with?” I asked.“Wardens,” he said.“Good for her,” I said.“Who are you and who are you with?” he asked.“Victoria Dallon.  Nobody, yet.  I’ve been interviewing for teams.”“She did pretty good work,” blindfold girl said.“Thank you,” I said.“When you three got the homeless out of the house, Vista said something under her breath.  I think it was ‘thank you’.  They were getting in her way somehow.”I nodded.  “I’m from her town.  I was briefly her teammate.”It was so mundane it was chilling and disconcerting, after the chaos we’d just weathered.  A few moments of horrible, of stupidity and damage and madness, and now we waited to see what happened next, waiting to see what the aftermath would be.  We talked about dumb things.“What do you think?” Rocketround asked.  “Not just asking you, Victoria.  Anyone.”It was in that question that I saw the first real hint that he was shaken.  He was doubting his own capacity in this.“This is going to hurt,” another cape said.  “People were already feeling pretty beaten down, and… ninety people?  We lost ninety?”“We don’t know if all of them are in trouble,” Laserdream said.“I think they might be,” blindfold girl said.Laserdream didn’t have a response for that.  She only hugged me tighter with the one arm.“I think-” I started.  “Just speculation.”“Any clues or guesses about what’s going on would be good,” Rocketround said.  He was gripping his upper arm as he stood with arms folded.  He’d emphasized ‘any’, which only served to emphasize how little a clue he and we had.“The broken triggers are pretty out there.  Not a lot of consistent points or facts… except that they’re big,” I said.“Big?” a nearby cape asked.“They tend to cover a lot of ground.  Shaker stuff.”“Yeah,” Rocketround said.  “That’s come up in briefings.”“Location, environment, and position matters a lot,” I said.  “The capes closest to the perimeter were least mobile.  I think the further they got from the center, the less flex there was.  Until their agents wouldn’t let them move at all.”“Typhlosis pointed that out,” Rocketround said, indicating the girl with the blindfold.“We might want to make them stay put,” I said.“Yeah,” Rocketround said.  “We’ll do that.”Someone else spoke up.  A remark about common thread through the powers they’d seen.  Others chimed in.I only half-listened.  A lot of images stayed with me.  The faces I’d seen midway through the one fragmented trigger, the indents in the car as the phantom limbs had reached out for it, Anne.  The lingering sensation of Anne clinging to me, hard, the touch on my face.  I didn’t know what she had wanted to communicate.  A last kind gesture?“There we go,” the blindfolded girl said.  “Pulse.  Nobody else affected.”“I’m going to approach,” Rocketround said.  “Roadblock?  I’d appreciate it if you came.”“Of course,” a cape by the side said.  A guy in heavy armor.“Protect me if we run into any trouble.”“Only four left,” Typhlosis said.“Four?” Rocketround sounded surprised.Laserdream’s head snapped around.  Looking at me, looking at Typhlosis.Typhlosis continued, “Only four alive, still.  The rest went down.  Eaten by their powers, or they tried to move when they couldn’t, and their brains caved in.”I squeezed Laserdream’s hand.I might have been less surprised than her because I’d read up more on how these things tended to go.“Let’s go,” Rocketround said.  “Anyone comfortable joining me, come.”They speed-marched toward the center of the effect.  One hand on another cape’s arm for support and guidance, Typhlosis directed us toward the nearest surviving cape.“Three,” she said, as we got close enough to see him.He was a man, mid-twenties.  His legs and stomach were buried in a writhing mass of something very similar to the origami road I’d seen earlier, materials made thin, folded many times over, until they didn’t quite seem to be three dimensions anymore.  Some of those materials were the pieces of the twenty or so people in his immediate vicinity.A lone figure, standing on a hill of the fallen citizen workers, caught up in the broken trigger’s effect.“Don’t move!” Rocketround shouted.  “Alright!?”“Not moving,” was the response, quiet.“No using powers.  Stay put, stay calm.  We’re going to find out a way to help you.”“I don’t think I can be helped,” the man said.  His head was bowed, and he couldn’t seem to move it.  His hair was long, tied back into a low ponytail, and it covered much of his face.“We can figure something out,” Rocketround said.“Two,” Typhlosis said, quiet.Two parahumans left.The effect had caught over ninety over what couldn’t have been more than fifteen minutes.  Now there were two.“I’m worried,” the man in the clearing’s center said.  “I can feel all the others.”He moved his hand.Every body in the vicinity moved.  A matching movement of hands, limp arms rolling off of sides or fingers digging into powdered sidewalk.“Don’t move!” Rocketround called out.“I’m on a brink, and I can’t see it, but I can feel it,” the man said.“Try not to think about it,” Rocketround said.  “Okay?”“I can feel it,” the man said.  He wasn’t paying much attention to Rocketround.  “All the way down to this vast well, partially filled with potential energy.  Like I’m on the lip of a volcano and it’s an impossibly long fall with only magma at the bottom.  I don’t know if I’m better off throwing myself down into that or leaving it alone.”“Leave it alone,” I said, my voice joining more than one other person’s.“What if my thoughts and brain get made into a part of that?  One piece in that thing’s construction.  What if it makes me immortal, forever a part of this thing?  A recording of me in there, how I think, how I do things.”“We’ve studied parahumans, powers and power sources a lot,” Roadblock said.  “We’re pretty sure that’s not a thing.”“Yeah,” the guy in the clearing’s center said.  “But…”He trailed off.“It’s not a thing,” Rocketround’s voice joined Roadblock’s.“But I’m standing closer to it than you are,” the man said.  “And from where I stand, I feel like it might be.”Nobody had a ready response to that.“One,” Typhlosis murmured.“I’m the last one standing on the brink now,” the man said.  “I don’t think I can do this much longer.  Do I embrace it or turn away?  I wish I could see you, to-”He reached up, to move his hair out of his eyes.“Don’t!” I called out.  My voice wasn’t the only voice of protest, but it might have been the first.  Perhaps because I was most mindful of arms that weren’t mine, in my immediate vicinity.The arms of people all around him operated as extensions of him.  A matching, reaching movement, up and out.  Some disintegrated as they moved, but one lying next to him reached up, out, and into the finely spun construction of road that cocooned the man’s legs.As I’d done to the altered road, the reaching arm broke the construction like it was sugar crystal or a snow globe.  There was a spray of blood, and the man dropped, jerking as his Corona Pollentia remained in place, briefly suspending him.  He was dead in that instant, well before he sprawled to the ground, shattered from the waist down.My hand held Laserdream’s tight.I was thankful that Typhlosis didn’t give us an updated count.⊙Crystal had backed me up for a good while.  She’d been a friend, a support.She had performed during the event.  She’d been focused, she’d done what she needed to do.  It had been after that she faltered.  Hearing that the people who’d been touched by the broken trigger weren’t doing well, then hearing that only four remained.  Hearing and seeing those four drop away.It had been that way for Leviathan, too.It had probably been that way after I went to the hospital.Fine during, not so fine after.It had been ten days, now.  Ten days after the broken trigger with the citizen workers.  One of the worst we’d seen for citizen casualties and damage.I landed on the balcony, letting myself in.  I took the carton out of the plastic bag and popped it into the microwave, lid ajar.  Eighteen seconds.“Vic?” Crystal called out.“I’m here.  One second.”“That had better not be what I think it is.”“It is.”Crystal groaned audibly.I pulled the carton free, grabbed some spoons, and walked over to the living room.  Crystal was sitting in the armchair, watching TV, a blanket on her lap.She glared at me, but it was a mock glare, and it softened considerably as she saw the carton.“Slightly melted brownie caramel ice cream,” I said.  I collapsed onto the couch, reaching high overhead to hold the carton and a spoon out to her.  “I’ll share it with you.”“Well, if you’re sharing it…”“I’ll exercise with you too, to work it off.  For now, though, it’s comfort food, staying cozy, and keeping each other company.”“Okay.  You’re mostly forgiven.”“And a stupid-in-a-good-way movie to watch,” I said, pulling the movie case out of the pocket I’d wedged it into.  “Because it turns out TV sucks after the world ends, and I can’t watch you subject yourself to it.”“Okay,” she said.  “You’re forgiven.”I popped the movie in, then settled on the couch, pulling a blanket over my legs, arranging a cushion to sit up against.  I fetched my phone and checked my messages.  A second cancellation from Jessica.After a disaster like that, too many people needed looking after.I twisted my head around to look at Crystal, as she ate a spoonful of icecream from the carton.  She passed it to me and I took a bite for myself, from the side she hadn’t dug into.  I passed it back, watching as the movie started.My turn to look after Crystal.⊙The lights were off in the coffee shop, though it wasn’t dark with the light coming in through the windows.  The majority of the customers were sitting on the outside patio, and the interior was quiet, empty, and cool.It was eerie, to go from the disaster to the more or less quiet period after.  To be back on this street, where the car had hit the pillar, and where I’d seen so much grief from one person, and to try and reconcile that with the broken trigger, the ninety dead, the fact that so many were dealing by ignoring it.  Moving on a matter of two weeks after the fact.“Victoria?” the barista asked me.My first thought was that she’d recognized me.  “Yes?”“Your friend stepped into the back.  She said she’d be right out, but she asked us to keep an eye out for you so you didn’t think she was late.”“Got it.  Thank you.”“Can I get you anything?”I looked outside.  Sunny, warm.  The summer and its heat lingered in the daytime.  “I can’t bring myself to drink anything hot when the weather’s like this.  Do you have any suggestions?”“Ice coffee?  Iced tea?  Pop?”“Iced tea, please,” I said, noting the use of ‘pop’.  A lot of people from a lot of regions had gathered in the megalopolis.I didn’t have to sit down and wait for her to bring it to me.  It was in my hands within a matter of seconds, and I took it to the seat furthest from the door, where Jessica and I would have some privacy.She was out of the washroom before I’d fully settled in.  Her blouse had buttons at the front and a collar, but was sleeveless, tucked into shorts.  I wondered if she looked less at ease in casual clothing because she was a professional at heart, or if it was personal bias and years of knowing her as the therapist in the office that colored my perceptions.  Her hair was damp, and she had what might’ve been a folded paper towel, soaked with water, resting on the back of her neck.  She collected a drink she must have ordered and paid for earlier.“Doing alright?” I asked.Jessica smiled.  “I was cooling down.  I’ll be glad when the weather is more comfortably cool.”“Yeah,” I said.  “It’s not that I mind the heat.  It’s that I worry about how it affects people.  I get antsy when the weather is like this.”Jessica nodded.  She glanced out the window.  “It doesn’t help.”“Brockton Bay was always nice, weather-wise.  It didn’t have a lot going for it, but it did have mild weather.  Once upon a time.”Jessica smiled.  “It’s good to remember the good things.  At the risk of slipping into habit, I’ll ask: how are you doing?  You’re okay, after the broken trigger incident?”“I’m okay.  My cousin wasn’t, but she’s bounced back.  I think it was a wake-up call.”“How so?”“She might be reconsidering if she wants to be with the PRTCJ.  She might aim for something lower-key.  Her mom did, after things went bad in Brockton Bay.”“I hope she’s happy and comfortable, wherever she ends up.  I did like her, when she and I crossed paths.”At the hospital.  That fragment went unspoken.“How’s the girl I found?” I asked.“She’s managing.  We’re getting her stabilized and figuring out her power.  She wants to meet you at some point, to thank you.”“She’s good, though?”“Far better than she was.”I nodded.“The broken trigger aside, how have you managed since we last talked?  You talked about joining a team.”I gave her a one-shoulder shrug.  “Pitched myself to a few.  It didn’t take.  I lost my job, the volunteer stuff feels empty.  I’ll survive in the meantime.”“I find it very interesting that you asked about Hunter, and you wanted to clarify that she wasn’t just managing, she was good.  Then I ask you, and your response is that you’re surviving.  You’re managing.”“You’re going therapist mode on me,” I remarked, smiling.She smiled back.“How are you?” I asked, before she could ask me the same.“I’m settling into my new role, trying to wrap things up and make sure there are no loose ends as I transition.  Are you-”“You said-” I said, inadvertently interrupting her.“Go ahead.”“You said you were busy.  Is busy a good thing, in Jessica-Yamada-land?”It took her a second to answer.  Not our usual one-sided dialogue, this, her talking, me waiting for a chance to communicate, already plotting how I could say what I wanted to say as efficiently as possible.  I smiled at the observation, and I was left pretty sure she caught it, because she smiled again.She replied, “I’m looking forward to when I have more time.  Right now, it’s balancing out.  Any exhaustion on my part is easier to deal with because the things I’m doing are new, exciting, a little terrifying, but positive overall.”“Terrifying?  Because of the people you’re dealing with, or…?”“When working with patients, the first and last meetings are the hardest, with the stakes greatest, and I’m having an awful lot of first and last meetings these days.  Maintaining course after the initial connections have been made is easier.  I know who I’m talking to and what I’m doing, there will be peaks, plateaus and valleys, but I can generally feel like there’s progress being made.  The first meetings and the goodbyes?  They’re critically important.”“You want to make sure you’re laying good groundwork.”“It’s not just that.  The wrong kind of connection or break can do a lot of damage.  Failing to realize you’re hurting a patient when you say something or take an approach, failing to be strong enough from the outset with patients who need a hard line, being too hard on patients who need a soft touch…”I nodded.  I started to think about which I’d been, back then, but thinking back was hard and unpleasant.“I…”  She’d started to say something, and then stopped.“You?”She sighed, leaning back in her seat.“I’ve put myself in an awkward position here,” she said.  “Actually a few, including you and me sitting here having this conversation.  I want to get right to it so you’re not talking to me under the wrong pretenses, but I’m not sure how to navigate this, either.”“Is there anything I can do to help?”“That’s just it,” she said.  She frowned.  “I wanted to have a conversation with you for another reason.”That stung, in a way.  That we weren’t meeting up for the sake of meeting up.“Okay,” I said.“I might have made a mistake,” she said.  “And I was thinking you might be able to help.”                                                                                             Flare – 2.5                                                                                           “A mistake?”“I worry it’s the case.  Time will tell, but I can make educated guesses and I have concerns.”“I have to admit, I’m not sure how to respond to that,” I said.  “I’d say you’re only human or you’re only mortal, but doesn’t that sound condescending, coming from a parahuman?”“We’re all mortal, Victoria.  Even Scion was.”I nodded.It was strange to hear that name spoken out loud.  Nine out of ten times, people would avoid saying it out loud.  As if they couldn’t reconcile the first hero with the thing that had ended the world.“I’d like to help,” I said.  “A couple of things are off the table, obviously, but you know what they are, I think.  I wouldn’t be okay if you wanted me to reach out to my sister, or that kind of thing.”“I wouldn’t ask you to do that, no.  This isn’t anything of that scale, but…” she frowned.  “Given our relationship, with you having been my patient, there’s a power imbalance.  I want to do what I can to ensure I don’t abuse it.  I want to be fair to you.”“Okay,” I said.  After a pause, I added, “I appreciate the sentiment.”“Even if this turns out to be minor, it is hard to do without risking a breach of trust and damage to our friendship.”“Okay,” I said.“I want to ensure we’re on the same page, when it comes to expectations.  I definitely don’t want you to feel obligated, whether it’s because you feel you owe me something, or because you feel you should.  I know there’s a tendency among heroes to want to step forward and help.  I’ve counseled many a junior hero that they needed to learn to pick their battles.”“I have no idea what you mean,” I said.  “I pick my battles.  Except for the broken trigger last week, the community center, and, oh, everything else.”“It is a concern,” she said.  She matched my smile with a small one of her own, but it was fleeting, more an acknowledgement of the joke than anything.  “You’re quick to say you want to help, before you even know what I’m going to ask.”I nodded.  “I don’t think you’d ask if you hadn’t thought over it.  I trust you.”“I’d still be concerned, grateful as I am for your trust in me.”I swished the ice in my iced tea.“I am sorry,” she said.“Sorry?”“If I’ve upset you, approaching this like I have.”“Did I give you that impression?  That I was upset?”  I was pretty sure my face hadn’t betrayed anything.  I was reasonably sure my power wasn’t leaking, either.“You did.  And if I’m right about that, please don’t misunderstand me, I am sorry, and I wouldn’t fault you for being upset.  I would like to have meetings like the one I think you were anticipating today.  You and me, staying in touch to a degree, talking over iced tea and ice coffee.  I’d hoped to have one of those meetings before getting around to this topic.”So it wasn’t too urgent, then.“Okay,” I said.  I took another careful sip of my iced tea.She drew in a deep breath, reached back to where the damp, folded paper towel was laying against her neck, and set it within the lid of her iced coffee, which she’d put to one side.  She stared down at it for a moment.I waited.  I had some ideas about what she was getting around to.  I also had things I might have said, but I was worried that, depending on what she was going to say next, they could be things I’d regret.  If her reasons were good, if they were personal…I was so fucking done with regrets.  I didn’t want to add more, especially any tied to Jessica.“I don’t want to compound my mistakes elsewhere with one here.  With that in mind, I want to make it absolutely clear that this isn’t an obligation.  I’d like a bit of help, if you heard me out and were comfortable giving it.  I’d explain the situation as best as I could, but the confidentiality of other patients makes things difficult.”“What do you need?”“Before we get into that, touching back on what I said before about wanting to be fair to you, I’ve contacted a colleague.  He’ll be your therapist if you still want one.  He’s waiting for your call and he’ll make an appointment with you.”“You didn’t have to do that.  I wouldn’t want to burden you guys more.  What’s going on, that you’re going to all this?”“Maybe it’s necessary, maybe not, but it’s my apology and my thanks to you for having this conversation with me, and for any compromise of the relationship.  It doesn’t mean you have to hear me out, and it absolutely doesn’t mean you have to say yes.  Alright?”“Alright, but it doesn’t matter,” I said.  “I’ll hear you out.”“It matters to me,” she said, firm.“Okay,” I said, a little exasperated.  It was clear Jessica was stubborn when she was bothered by something.  “Fine.  You made a mistake, you want my help.  I’ll phone your colleague and possibly go see him.  I’ll weigh what you’re asking and I’ll try to make an objective decision.  Which may be no.”“Thank you.”“What do you need?” I asked, again, holding my iced tea in both hands.⊙Mrs. Yamada wasn’t ‘Jessica’ anymore, not any more than capes went by their civilian names in costume.  She was in her professional attire, a suit jacket over a blouse, a business skirt, minimal jewelry, minimal and tasteful makeup.  Papers rustled as she paged through files and as the wind blew into the room.She had told me to dress in a way that was comfortable for me.  It was still hot out and I’d had to travel forty miles to get to a place where Mrs. Yamada could pick me up to drive me the rest of the way.  Even though the heat persisted, the weather had broken, the humidity giving way to a light thunderstorm.  I wore a white dress with a black hood built into it, the Brockton Bay skyline printed in what looked like black and grey watercolors across the breast, the city’s name below and to the side.  There was a scribbling of more watercolor and lettering at the hem.  The white fabric was a thin sweatshirt-like material, so the hood hadn’t been much use against the rain.The windows were open and the blinds closed, periodically clacking against the windowsills.  The wind wasn’t blowing in a direction that sent the rain into the room, but droplets still beaded the blinds closer to the bottom.  The lights felt artificially bright, in contrast to how dark the clouds and sky were outside.  The room was set up like a high school classroom, minus the ‘class’, no students, no mess, no bulletin board with scraps on it or whiteboard with weeks-old marks that hadn’t been wiped away.  Eight chairs were arranged in a ring at the center, instead of five columns of six desks.There was a teacher’s desk at the front, and Mrs. Yamada was there, looking over some files.  I’d caught some glimpses of the pictures on the fronts, purely by accident.  I could have pried more, maybe caught a name or a heading by reading upside-down, and I’d decided not to.  She wouldn’t have wanted me to.“Do I have a file?” I asked.  She startled a little, as if she’d forgotten I was there.She’d been in the zone, I realized.  She might have needed to be.  She didn’t wear it on her face or in her body language, but there was a reason she was so immersed in what she was reading.I could relate to that, in a way.  During my hospital stay, I’d delved deep into my studies, struggled with the keyboard as I read everything I could find, while furthering my studies with long-distance education.“Sorry to interrupt,” I said.“It’s fine.  You did have a file.  You don’t now, I’m afraid.  Unless it’s somewhere in the rubble.”I nodded.She glanced at the clock.  “One of the group’s members tends to arrive early.  She should be here momentarily.”I looked up at the clock.  One fifty in the afternoon.  From how dark it was outside, I might have thought it was five hours later in the day.  “Good to know.”“It will be interesting to see how you two get on.”“Huh.”I heard the footsteps and glanced at the clock again.  Not even a minute had elapsed.  Was this person that punctual?I wasn’t sure what I’d expected.  She wasn’t yet a teenager,  or if she was then she was a late bloomer, but she wasn’t wholly a ‘child’ either.  ‘Tween’.  My first thought was that she was as cute as a button, and not in the pink princess way.She was black, her arms and legs long and skinny, her eyes large in proportion to her face.  She was studying me with just as much or more intensity than I studied her, as we sized each other up.She was dressed or had been dressed with an eye for modern fashion, fitting to her age.  She wore a blue corduroy pinafore dress with metal studs forming a star shape at the leg.  Her top was a t-shirt, with an image on it in sequins, the kind that had two different images, depending on the direction the sequins were swept.  The image depicted a blue heart if brushed one way, a yellow star if swept the other; I knew because it was a jumbled mix of both.The reason I thought that she might have been dressed by someone else was that she was so very precise about how she’d put her outfit together.  It was freshly ironed or fresh off the rack, and it was color matched from her shoes to the pins and ties in her hair.  The star theme too.  Kinky black hair had been fixed into place at the side of her head with a star pin, and carefully arranged into two small, tight buns at the back.  Glossy and taken care of, not a strand out of place.  It would have taken me twenty or thirty minutes to do the same, and my straight hair would have been easier to manage, even being as long as it was.“Hi,” she said.“Hi,” I responded.“Gosh, you’re pretty,” she said.I was momentarily lost for words.  Very direct.“Thank you,” I said, glancing back at Mrs. Yamada, hoping for a cue.  She was focusing on her notes.  She briefly met my eye, but communicated nothing.“I can tell you were a hero.  You have that air about you,” the girl said.“Thank you,” I said, a little caught off guard.  “It’s nice to meet you.”She smiled, her enthusiasm renewed, “It’s amazing to meet you.  I’m really interested to hear what you have to say.  I really want to be a hero, so I’m trying to learn all I can.”“That could be good.  It’s better than the alternative, at least.”“Isn’t it?  You were probably a good one, weren’t you?  You give me that impression.  You’re stylish, I really like your dress, and you have that posture, back straight, unyielding.  Only the best and the true up-and-comers have that.”“Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada said.“Yes?”“There’s no pressure.”Kenzie only smiled in response.“It’s okay,” I said.  I was glad to have a window to speak.  “I like your outfit too, Kenzie.  Good clothes are so hard to get these days, aren’t they?”“This outfit was part of a birthday present, but I think it was expensive, yeah.  I wanted to look nicer since we had someone new today.”“There’s no need to go to extra trouble.  Not for me.”“No trouble, no trouble,” she said, very cavalier.  She looked at Mrs. Yamada, “How are you today, Mrs. Yamada?”“I’m doing very well today, Kenzie.  How are you this morning?”“Can’t complain,” Kenzie said.  “Does it matter where I sit?”“Nothing’s changed from the prior sessions.  Sit wherever you’re comfortable, it doesn’t matter.”Kenzie smiled.  “I think it matters.  It means something.  Can I sit here?”“Sure,” I said.She seated herself in the chair next to the one I was standing beside.I snuck a glance at Mrs. Yamada, and I saw concern.  Because of the others who were due to arrive?“You probably caught my name, I’m Kenzie.”She was extending a hand for me to shake.  I shook it, then turned the chair a bit as I sat down.  “Victoria.  Some call me Vicky, but I’m using that less these days.  You can use it if it’s easier.”“And you’re a heroine?”“I used to be.  I’m on hiatus.”“That’s the coolest thing,” Kenzie said.  “Costumes, fighting bad guys.”“It had its ups and downs,” I said.  I glanced at Mrs. Yamada.  Her focus was on her notes.She noticed me looking and asked, “You used to be her patient?”“I did.”“She’s the best,” Kenzie said, leaning over and speaking with a voice quiet enough that Mrs. Yamada wouldn’t necessarily hear.“Yeah,” I said.  Except for her apparent mistake here, which I wasn’t equipped to make a judgment call on.  Not quite yet.“It’s good here; I always look forward to coming.  Everyone’s pretty neat.  That might not mean a lot coming from me, though.”“How come?”“I think everyone’s pretty neat,” she said.“I see.  That’s admirable.”The papers rustled.  Mrs. Yamada put the files in a filing cabinet beside the desk at the end of the room, locking them away.  She spoke aloud, “Can I get you two anything?  Water?”“I’m fine, but thank you,” Kenzie said.“No thank you,” I said.“The others may be a bit late, with the weather being what it is.”“I think we’ll survive the wait,” Kenzie said.  “Right, Victoria?”“We’ll survive.  Past years have taught me patience, if nothing else,” I said.“From being a Ward?  Were you a Ward?” Kenzie asked.That wasn’t where or why, I thought, but I said, “Very briefly.  My family had a team.  Still does, kind of.”Very kind of.“Oh, wow, neat.”I tried to find a diplomatic way to respond to that.“Or not so neat?” Kenzie said.“Ups and downs,” I said.“I was with the PRT, but I wasn’t a Ward exactly,” she said.  “They had trouble sticking me anywhere, and then I went into training, and got to do a lot of really neat camps and exercises and travel, because they had to wait until I was old enough before they could put me where they really wanted to put me.”“Which was?”“Watchdog, grrr,” she said.  She’d made a pretty sad attempt at a growl, mischief in her eyes.  “That other branch that worked under the PRT that you almost never hear about.  Oversight and investigation, powers, money, and politics.”“I know of Watchdog.”“Cubicle superheroes.”“They’re actually pretty badass from what I heard, and they do- did a lot of fieldwork and investigations, raiding offices, interrogations, talking to politicians, uncovering conspiracies.”“That’s true.”“There’s something about getting organized and going after that thinker or that tinker who’s been working behind the scenes, the guy that’s been subverting society for their own gain, when they’ve probably spent months or years making contingency plans and anticipating the day their world and their plans come crashing down around them.  I think that dynamic is pretty damn cool, the approach and the complexity of it.”“Hmm, that is cool,” she said.  “Except there aren’t any awesome costumes or monster fighting.”“Less monster fighting, I’m sure.  I’m not sure about the costumes.  There are probably masks, I guess?”“And there’s some cublical- bleh.  Cubicle jockeying.”She spoke so fast she had tripped over the word.I replied, “Probably a lot, yeah.  But from my short stint in the Wards, there was a lot of paperwork there too.”“That’s so true.  I was kind of a Ward, so I had to do some.  I think I was good at the paperwork.”I was starting to feel like she’d been the one who had fussed with her appearance, rather than any parental figure.  Someone so fussy would’ve somehow been mentioned in the life story to this point.  It was very believable, too, to draw a connection between the fastidious appearance and her pride in the paperwork.“I think I was too.”She nodded, the conversation momentarily, almost mercifully pausing, then she found her place, enthusiasm returning.  “So yeah.  I was bouncing all over the place.  The Youth Guard stepped in, I’m not sure if you’ve had to deal with them.”The Youth Guard or the Y.G. were the group that acted like the union that protected minors in Hollywood.  That had protected minors in Hollywood.  They were the group that made sure that Wards’ education and options didn’t suffer as a consequence for them being superheroes, that they didn’t dress provocatively, that they were safe and sane, that nobody took advantage, and other stuff.  They’d reached out to my parents at one point, because they weren’t limited to the PRT.  They were a guillotine that had hung over the heads of any team with under-eighteen heroes or heroines.“I’ve heard the horror stories,” I said.“They weren’t a horror story for me.  They said I was being moved around too much and I needed to go somewhere to stay.  Not going to the fun camps and training sucked, but I went back to Baltimore, and I got to set up my workshop, fi-nuh-ly.”“Workshop, huh?”“Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada spoke up.  She still sat at the desk.  “You might want to be mindful of what you reveal.  I’ll get into that more when things get started, but take a moment and think before revealing things that might tie into your cape identity, or identifying parts of your background.”“Yes, Mrs. Yamada,” Kenzie said.  Then she leaned close to me, whispering, “I took a moment to think and I think I’m safe telling you I’m a tinker.”“Gotcha,” I said, mimicking her volume and whisper.“Yep,” she said.  She pitched her voice lower, “The Youth Guard was good to me.  I liked the people who I worked with there, even if the people in charge of me didn’t.  Some of my favorite people next to Mrs. Yamada worked for them.  Not that that lasted for long.  That was only the spring of twenty-thirteen-”As she talked, I glanced at Mrs. Yamada.  It was clear she heard.“-and then, well…”“Yeah,” I said.Gold Morning.I was a little caught off guard by Kenzie, on a few fronts.  This wasn’t what I’d expected.  I glanced at the other chairs.⊙I got into a more comfortable position in the little booth, leaning against the window and taking a moment to digest what Mrs. Yamada had shared.  Someone else walked into the dark little shop, going straight to the counter, their eyes on the desserts behind the display.“Group therapy?” I asked.“With the full-time position I’m taking with the Wardens, I have the chance to help a lot of critical individuals.  The people I’ll be helping will be people who can help a lot of people in turn.  An incredible number, in some cases.  As attached as I am to my current patient caseload, and as much as I would like to take you on as a patient, it made the most sense to go this route.”“Okay,” I said.She frowned a little.“But?” I asked.“The role I held between Gold Morning and now was always going to be a transient one.  My patients and everyone else involved knew I was only seeing the patients I’m seeing now in a temporary way.  I’m one of several therapists who are rotating through a patient caseload, and only half were my patients and mine alone.  In making a transition, it is and was still my responsibility to look after those exclusive patients.”“Okay.”  I connected that thought to how she’d found a therapist for me.  When it was a chore to get therapists to take new patients, it amounted to a pretty meaningful gesture.“I’m referring the ones I can to other therapists.  I’m in touch with twelve people who work with parahumans and a few who are breaking into that field.  Not a single one of us is working less than seventy hours a week.  Some of my patients didn’t need counseling anymore, and I was only helping them to find their equilibrium after Gold Morning.  Others are on their way to a new facility in this world’s Europe, which they’ve been anticipating for over a year now.  If you were still in the same condition as you were when I first met you, I would be recommending you go there.”I nodded.  I didn’t like thinking about it.“I couldn’t find places for everyone, and I’d turn down the job before I abandoned patients in need.  With the remainder, I saw common ground among them.  Not all of them, but enough of them that it seemed like things could be workable.  Some supplied, needed, or were looking into the same kinds of assistance, which is what prompted the line of thinking.  I was going to introduce them regardless, I could see them talking, and I thought it would be best to have the initial and deeper talks in a supervised setting.”“And from there, it was a short jump to thinking about group therapy.”“Yes.  Group therapy, interpersonal group therapy, seemed appropriate for what I wanted them to address with each of them.  It meant that in the time before I took on my full-time role with the Wardens, I could devote more time to more of them.  In an ideal world, if there were some who still needed attention by the time I was done, I could call in favors or find places for them.”“Okay,” I said.  “Was it group therapy like I was a part of?”“The therapy you were a part of was encounter-driven.  Different.  More involved, more simulations, acting and role-playing, confrontation, learning assertiveness as opposed to, say, aggressive behavior, or overly passive behavior.  Engaging with peers.”“I didn’t really do anything except sit there.”“But you wrote the scripts.  You listened to the others, and you visualized ways you wanted the conversations to go.  I got the impression it was pretty intense, even when you were a step removed in your participation.”“Sure,” I said.  A large part of what I’d contributed to those sessions had played into my last interaction with my mom.Not that that interaction had gone well, but I could imagine that if I’d found myself in that same situation without the grounding of knowledge from those sessions, I might not have had the words to articulate as much of what I’d wanted to.  It was even possible that, without the conflict resolution skills, I might have hurt someone.The recollections of the therapy and of my mom were heavy, pressing down on me and my chest.  I took a long sip of my iced tea.  It was cold and sensory, pulling me away from that rabbit hole of dark thoughts.“This group was intended to be slower-paced, less intense,” she said.“Even with the time constraint?”“Yes, even with.  Part of it is that, as I said, it was the most appropriate for what I wanted to address.”“Part?”“The other part ties back to what I said about introductions, how the first meetings are the trickiest.  It was a delicate balancing act to begin with, compared to your group, where we added someone new once every few weeks or months, while the rest of the group remained fairly stable.  With this group, having them all meet at once, I thought it would be best to keep things calmer.”“Makes sense,” I said.“My colleagues like to say there is a truism with groups of parahumans.  That the larger the group in question, the greater the chance of a schism or disaster.  I’m not sure I like exactly how the idea is presented a lot of the time it comes up, but…”I thought of my sister.“Groups of capes get pretty volatile,” I finished the sentence for her.  “Each person you add is another chance for things to go wrong.”⊙Three more members joined the group.  An unknown boy and two people I knew, male and female.When I realized who I was looking at, though, my jaw dropped.  I stood from my chair.She, for her part, was on a similar page.  She stared at me, confused at first.  Then reality dawned for her as well.She was pale in a way that skin didn’t tend to be, and she had a mane of black hair.  A small black tattoo marked her cheekbone, partially obscured by skin-tone makeup that had streaked in the rain.  For all that she was almost monochrome from the neck up, she was a riot of color from the neck down.  Sveta.Her hands went to her mouth.She closed the distance between us with a half-stagger, half-run kind of movement.  I caught a glimpse of her tearing up before she threw her arms around me, colliding with me.  I caught my bearings and hugged her back.“You’re okay,” she mumbled into my shoulder.“I’m-” I started, lost for words.  I looked at Weld, who stood in the doorway, smiling as wide as I’d ever seen him smile.My arms still around her, I reached out with one hand, groping in Weld’s general direction, as if I could get the words that way.“Fantastic,” Weld said.  “This is perfect.”He looked a little less neat than he’d been when I’d known him in Brockton Bay, but not as wild or ‘monstrous’ as I’d seen in the pictures online, back when he’d been a member of the Irregulars.  His skin was dark iron, his eyes silver, veins of more silver tracing from the corners of the eyes.  His hair was wire, made to look more free and unruly.  He was wearing a henley shirt, khaki shorts and sandals that looked like they were made of metal and what might’ve been tire rubber.  I couldn’t imagine any other material that would hold up when bearing the weight of someone that was heavy metal from head to toe.Beside him was a guy, brown-skinned, with the sides and back of his hair cut short.  The hair on top had to have been painted rather than dyed, because it was magenta, and I couldn’t imagine getting black hair dyed magenta without bleaching it to the point of destroying it, and the rolling curls retained their shape despite the droplets of rain that clung to it.  He was smiling, but more because he looked like the type that very much enjoyed others being happy.  The magenta-haired guy’s shirt was form-fitting to his upper body, showing off lean muscle, and looked like a surfer’s rash guard.  He wore black shorts and sandals.I turned my attention to the girl of the trio.  I couldn’t believe it was Sveta.Who was practically sobbing now, apparently.Emotion was welling in my own chest.  I put my hand on the back of her head, and I felt the hair stir, the tissues beneath the wig moving.“Well, I think this has made my everything,” Weld said.“Your everything?” the magenta-haired guy asked.“Saying it made my day, my week, or even my month wouldn’t be enough,” Weld said, still smiling.  “You’re okay, Victoria?”“Two arms, two legs,” I said.“That’s great,” he said.  “Sveta was so attached to you, she hated leaving you behind.”Sveta nodded, head rubbing against my shoulder.“And we’d thought you’d died,” Weld said.  “When G.M. happened.  Hearing you were alive was amazing on its own, but you’re… you’re back.  Fantastic.”Sveta made a sound, emotions pouring over, before hiccuping with a sob.I stroked the back of her head, trusting that someone would tell me not to if it was dangerous.Then again, I didn’t have my forcefield up.I could have mentioned it.  I didn’t.“You have a body,” I whispered.  I could feel it.  It was hard, unyielding.  She creaked in places, and the way she’d moved- the colors and textures I’d seen-None of that mattered.  She had a body.“It took some doing,” Weld said.  “It took a lot of doing.  It’s been a whole adventure to get even this far.  It’s not even tinkertech.  Regular prosthetics and some inventiveness from some really stellar people.  Arms, legs, body, some stuff to keep it upright, some machine learning systems that adapt to meet her partway, and a lot of practice on her part, to operate everything internal.”Sveta pulled away.  She looked me in the eye, reaching up to wipe at her tears.  The hands didn’t seem cooperative enough, almost like someone holding a baseball bat by one end was trying to wipe away tears with the other.I hesitated, before indicating her face.  “Do you want a hand?”She nodded, and I wiped the tears away with my fingers.  She smiled, even as more welled up.“You’re such a sneak, Jessica,” Weld said.  “Not telling us?”“I did tell you Victoria was recovered.”“I thought you meant she was mobile enough to get to the meeting place on her own.  I didn’t think you meant a complete and total recovery,” Weld said.I wanted to turn to see Mrs. Yamada’s expression, but it was hard to move with Sveta hugging me.  She was silent, though.Behind Weld, someone else was ducking into the room.  He looked like he was of a height with Kenzie, but given how boys developed slower, he might’ve been a touch older.  He had a mess of tousled brown hair that would have been over his eyes if he wasn’t wearing large headphones as a kind of hairband.  He had a very flat expression as he walked around the perimeter of the room.  His t-shirt was black with a logo I didn’t recognize, his cargo shorts had stuff packed into the pockets, but he mostly looked like a very average kid.  Only his old fashioned braces really stood out to me- the kind that made it hard for him to put his lips together.Sveta twisted around, one hand reaching out to me to steady herself.  She looked over at Kenzie, then at the magenta-haired fellow, and then at the new kid.  She failed on her first attempt at speaking, then managed.  “She was my first friend ever, that I can remember.”“I didn’t know that,” I murmured.“I didn’t have anyone, and- there was a time where I was cooped up in a sealed room in the hospital and stuff was going on outside, with the PRT and the other case fifty-threes.  They introduced me to people who were harder for me to hurt.  Victoria was one of them.  I liked her, and she knew Weld, and she put up with me for some reason, so we kept talking and meeting.”I leaned closer, whispering in her ear.  “For some reason?  You helped keep me sane.  You were my friend.”“Stop it, dummy.  You’re going to make me cry more,” she whispered back.  “And I can’t believe I’m finally hearing your voice for real.”And with that last statement she was tearing up more.“Since when are you this much of a crier?” I asked.“I’m all emotionally open and shit now,” she whispered.  “Blame Weld.  And blame yourself, being all normal and stuff.”“I’m pretty sure I just caught you saying my name just now,” Weld said.  “Maybe that’s my cue to duck out before you start badmouthing me.”“I’d never ever badmouth you,” Sveta said, at normal volume.  She’d turned to face him, and I held her arm to steady her as she swayed a bit.  “What would I even say?”“I hear people coming anyway,” Weld said.  He stopped, looking at Sveta and me, then smiled wide.  “This is fantastic.”Sveta hugged my arm.“You’ve said that a lot,” the Magenta-haired boy said.“I can’t even begin to tell you,” Weld said.  “In more than one way.  I’ll leave it for Victoria to share.”“Maybe we can chat another time,” the boy said.  “We could hang out.”“If Sveta, Victoria, and Jessica okay it,” Weld said, clapping a hand on the guy’s shoulder.  “I don’t want to throw any wrenches into the therapy or make anything awkward by blurring lines.”“Send me an email if you want to discuss it.  It’s always good to see you, Weld,” Mrs. Yamada said.“I’ll do that, and it’s good to see you too, Jessica.  I’m sorry I wasn’t able to make the time to sit in.”“Totally understandable.  Good luck.  We may run into each other if you stick with the Wardens.”“Excellent,” Weld said.  He glanced at us, delivering a wink probably more meant for Sveta than for me.  “Fantastic.  I’ll text you when I have an idea of what’s happening with my afternoon, Sveta.”“Good luck,” Sveta said.With a parting salute, he was gone.I took my seat, giving my hand to Sveta, as she collapsed into the chair on the other side of me.  Now that she wasn’t bear-hugging me, I could see that a lot of the color on her was that the prosthetic body she wore had been painted.  Bumps and collisions had chipped some of the paint, but from the neck down, everything that wasn’t covered in clothing was painted in rolling waves, in sea serpents, birds and reptiles.  The colors were bright and bold, like graffiti, the living things hot orange, the background cool blues and greens.  Her clothes were relatively plain, a black top and brown pants, and looked to be relatively thick and durable, but the plain-ness was marred by the small streaks and smudges of paint that she’d gotten on it, most of it in long, thin slashes.The seating arrangement put me between her and Kenzie.  Kenzie, for the time being, was leaning over to the new addition to the group, the boy with braces.  She seemed to be filling him in on what he’d missed.“Tristan,” the magenta-haired boy said, approaching.  He extended a hand.  I shook it.“Victoria.”“Will your brother be joining us today?” Mrs. Yamada asked.“I asked, he didn’t reply,” Tristan said.“Brother?” I asked.“Twin,” Tristan said.  He pointed at his hair.  “Part of the reason I make myself so easily identifiable.  He’s Byron, he used to have blue-green hair to match me, but he quit doing that.”“Good to know,” I said.Blue hair.I thought of my youngest cousin. Where Crystal had always had the red-magenta look, Eric had gone with the blue, dying his hair.  It was a sad, wistful thought.  With so many losses in recent memory, so much tumult, it felt very distant.  That distance didn’t make it it feel any less painful.  If I’d been burned on an hourly, daily or weekly basis for the last four years, the death of Eric and Uncle Neil would have been the very first time my hand was shoved down and held to the oven ring.Alarming and hard to process in how devastating and raw it had been, important, but still a very long time ago.I changed up my focus, “You all came in together.  Are you friends?”“No.  Or kind of?” Tristan asked.“Kind of,” Sveta said.Tristan explained, “I ran into Weld and Sveta on the way into the first session.  He dropped her off at the front door because he had a place to be, and I offered my arm.  Sveta and I geeked out together over Weld.”“He’s geek-out worthy,” I said.Tristan smiled.  “Does the impromptu Weld fan club have another member?”“Nah,” I said.  “No, I’m just a fan in a very mundane way.  I think he’s a good guy.”Sveta nodded emphatically.“At our first meeting, Tristan kept saying he was Weld’s number one fan,” Kenzie joined in.“Oh, that.  Don’t remind me,” Tristan said.“I won’t, then,” Kenzie said, deflating a little.Tristan sighed, glancing at the rest of the room.  “Nah, it’s no good to leave our guest in the lurch, and I’m supposed to be holding myself accountable.  You might as well share, I’ll take my licks.”“Alright,” Kenzie said, perking up considerably at the same time Tristan withered.  “So Tristan kept saying it, casually mentioning the posters he had before, and he had merchandise.”“Weld figurine, from his stint in the Boston Wards.  One where he was wearing his first costume, too,” Tristan said.  “I miss that thing.”“I want one,” Sveta said.  “Would it be weird if I had one?”Kenzie continued, “So he kept saying all that, because he was so psyched he got to meet Weld.  Then Sveta finally speaks up, and she was very quiet when she said it, but she said ‘I probably have you beat.’”“I’m competitive,” Tristan said.  “So I was pretty adamant that no, no she didn’t.”Sveta looked like she was on top of the world, smiling to herself.  She wiped at her face with one prosthetic hand- she still had tracks of tears on her face.  I leaned closer, whispering.  “Want a tissue?”She nodded.  I stood from my seat while the conversation continued.“…And she says she’s his girlfriend,” Kenzie said.Tristan sighed.  “Yep.”“She’s living with him, and they sleep in the same bed, and they make each other breakfast,” Kenzie said.I liked the mental image.  I liked that Sveta was smiling as much as she was.“It’s hard to beat that,” Tristan said.I collected a tissue from Mrs. Yamada’s desk, glancing at her.  She seemed pretty unbothered by this, so far.“I don’t think it’s about winning,” Sveta said.I handed the tissue to Sveta as I retook my seat, and she set about patting her cheeks dry.  A little bit more of the cover-up makeup came away from the tattoo.“Yeahhhh,” Tristan drew out the word.  He added,  “Easy to say when you’re the clear winner.”“That’s fair,” Sveta said.“That’s a joke, by the way.  I’m not being serious here.”“Yeah,” Sveta said.  “I was wondering there.”Another person had entered the room.  A boy, Caucasian, with shoulder-length brown-blond hair.  He had a cut under one eye and another cut on the bridge of his nose.  His jeans were ripped at the knee and his shirt was baggy, a size too big for him.  The sleeves were long, red where the torso was white, and they had been rolled up to the elbow.  His sneakers had seen a lot of abuse, by the looks of it.  The white parts were brown and grey in a way that made me suspicious that even a thorough cleaning wouldn’t get them purely white again.  He looked sixteen or seventeen.“But yeah, damn, I don’t look good enough in a dress, so I have to concede.  Hey Rain,” Tristan said.“Heya,” the boy who was apparently called ‘Rain’ said.  He took the empty seat next to Tristan. “Why are you wearing a dress?”“Just joking around.”There were still two empty seats.  One would be Jessica’s.  There’d be one more, then.“You made it here okay?” Tristan asked.“Yeah.  I got a ride.”“How are things?” Kenzie asked Rain.  She gestured at her head in a way I didn’t see, with her head blocking my view of the hand on the other side.Rain seemed to take a second to ponder it.  He frowned a little.  “Not great.”“Better or worse than last week?” Kenzie asked.“Let’s save the therapy-relevant stuff for the session,” Mrs. Yamada interrupted.  “Small talk and catching up for now, please.  We don’t want to get started before everyone’s here, and I want to go over ground rules and expectations before we ask anything too personal.”Kenzie smiled and shrugged, settling back into her seat, hands in her lap.“Alright,” Rain said.  He turned his attention to me.  “This is the heroine?”“Ex-, kind of,” I said.  “But yeah.  Victoria.”“Hi.  I’m Rain.  Spelled like the water that falls from the sky.”“Cape or civilian name?” I asked.“I hate that you have to ask.  Civilian.  And before you comment on it, yeah, I know.  It’s unusual, I’ve heard the jokes.”He’d said it as if his patience on the subject had run short a long time ago.  I threw up my hands in mock surrender, my mouth firmly shut.He said, “You said ex, but you didn’t sound sure.  Are you taking a break?  Or…?”“Trying to get back into it after a break, but ended up taking another short break to focus on some background stuff.   Getting a handle on things.”“Yeah,” he said, as if I’d said something very heavy, and he’d felt part of that weight.  “I feel like I’ve been trying to get a handle on things since I got my powers.”“For a while now, then?  If I can ask?”“Just under a year ago,” he said.  “I think, along with Chris, I’m the rookie here.”Post-Gold Morning.  That helped put things in context.Chris, too.  By process of elimination, he’d be the boy roughly Kenzie’s age.“Family thing.  You said that once,” Kenzie said.  Rain acknowledged that with a nod.“Second gen?” I asked.  I wondered if I had any kindred on that front.“There are a lot of questions you can ask about the parahuman stuff,” he said.  “When it comes to me, the answer to most of them is ‘it’s complicated’.”“That’s fair,” I said.  “For a while now I’ve thought that parahumans should get a membership card, materializing in our hands when we trigger, or arriving in the mail at the first opportunity.  A warning on one side, ‘handle with care’, and then on the other side, ‘shit is complicated, don’t ask’.  Something that we can flash now and again, like a get out of jail free card.”“Mine would be worn out, both sides,” Rain said.“I could get good mileage out of the ‘shit is complicated’ side,” Tristan said.“Now I feel left out,” Kenzie said.  “I’d like to think mine would be nice and neat, stored away as a just-in-case.”“Really?” Tristan asked.  “Really?”“Ruh-heally,” Kenzie said, with exaggerated emphasis and a roll of the eyes.  Tristan mirrored her pose some.“I do like the idea,” Rain said.  “The card.”Rain wasn’t a smiler, by the looks of it, but he’d seemed to relax more as I talked to him.“By the way, I should have asked, am I allowed to swear?” I asked, twisting around to face Mrs. Yamada.“Swearing is fine In moderation,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “Being here wouldn’t be nearly as positive if you couldn’t say what you wanted to say.  There’s a point where swearing takes away from the communication and expression I’m hoping to see, where you hide behind the swearing, or where it’s disruptive.  I think you six have a good sense of where that point is.  I may referee if we get close to it.”“Alright,” I said.“I remember the group therapy session we had back at the hospital,” Sveta said.“Yeah,” I said.  Sveta had only been there for the initial sessions.  She’d left, I’d stayed.  “Plenty of swearing.  But it was different, and we didn’t have any kids in the group.”“Well, not young kids,” Sveta said.I looked over at Kenzie and Chris.  “Will I be overstepping or bothering you if I call you kids?  I’m not sure where the comfort zones are.”Kenzie snorted.  “It’s fine.”“Nah,” Chris said, “Hospital?  You were at the Asylum?”He’d barely hesitated a second.  He’d been so quiet up until now, and then the moment I’d given him an avenue to join the conversation, he went straight from negation to asking questions.Not pleasant questions either.“Oh.  Sorry,” Sveta said, to me.  “I should have thought you might not want to broadcast it.  I’m sorry.  I kind of brought it up earlier, too.”On its own, it was something I could handle most of the time, but it might have been a return to the group therapy session, the presence of Sveta and Mrs. Yamada, even, and possibly the fact that I’d had a few reminders and it was harder and harder to surface, while it almost felt like Chris was pressing down.Dark, uncomfortable memories stirred.  Being paralyzed, silent, the interminable restlessness.  The way the things on the television and radio had been almost unbearable to see and listen to, not because of the subject matter, but because of my inability to change the channel or shut it off, even though I’d asked for it to be put on in the first place.I had to take a second to swallow and remember normal breathing and cadence again, after thinking about it.“Let’s not put too much pressure on Victoria, please,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “I understand that you might feel the need to vet her or figure out if you can trust her, and that makes sense, given the degree of what’s shared here, but let’s be fair.  Let’s keep the small talk small, I’ll outline things as we start, and you can decide if you’re uncomfortable.  If you are, then we’ll figure out a way to move forward.”“It’s okay,” I said.“If you’re sure.”“It’s fine,” I said, glad I was able to find and use a normal tone of voice without any giveaway.  I turned back to Chris, “Yeah.  I was there.  Arrived midway through twenty-eleven, year and a half, and then the Asylum-supported housing after.”“Right,” Chris said.  “Brockton Bay before that?”“Yeah,” I said.  I wondered for a second at his jumping to the conclusion, before I remembered I had the city and its name on my dress.“There was a lot of Brockton Bay in the news, before,” he observed.“Yeah,” I said.  “Not a lot of it good.”I wasn’t sure how to approach the conversation with Chris.  He was hard to read, in fashion, in expression- I’d glance at his mouth to see if he was smiling or frowning and I’d only see the braces.  He’d been quiet up until now, too, which meant I didn’t have a lot to go on.Something about him bothered me.  It wasn’t just the slant of his questions or the way it felt like they were pressing at me, but his demeanor, and little things about his appearance I couldn’t put my finger on.  The messiness of his hair was one of those things.  It looked like he had three cowlicks – two at either corner of his hairline and one by his temple.  With his hair pushed back by the headphones he hadn’t taken off, they looked a little like small bald patches with the way the hair splayed out from those points.  He held his hands with his fingers curled in.  It was offputting in a mild way that lined up with how he came hitting me with those uncomfortable, prying questions and comments.I wondered if he was one of the ones Mrs. Yamada had been worried about, as part of this group.  One of the additions that catalyzed something volatile.That might have been unfair.“Weld was there for a lot of it,” Sveta said, backing me up.  “I’ve heard some of what happened.  Things got scary.”In all fairness, as fond as I was of her, I did find something amusing in how it was Sveta saying that last bit.  “Scary’s a good way to put it.”“But you’re still wearing the shirt,” Rain observed.  “You’re attached to the city.”“Sure.  It’s my city.  I grew up there.”“But you admit it was scary?” Rain asked.“The city isn’t defined by what happened to it.  Just like we aren’t the bad experiences that happen to us,” I said.“Aren’t we?” Chris asked, leaning forward in his seat, elbows on his knees.  “We’re the sum of the things that have happened to us, good or bad.”“We aren’t,” I said, firmly.  Then, on a moment’s reflection, I added, “We can’t be.  There’s a lot of other things going into it.”“You’re making me think back to science class,” Rain said.  “I sucked at science.  What was it?  Nature or nurture?”“Nature versus nurture, yeah,” Chris said.“That’s it,” Rain said.  “I should have remembered that.  Are you all about the nature, then?”I thought of my family.  I’m not sure that’s much better.  Amy had agonized over that one.



“We’re getting into territory that’s close to being therapy again,” Mrs. Yamada said, rescuing me from the line of thinking.  “So I’m going to interrupt.  But it’s a good point to keep in mind for our discussions later today.  I’m keeping an eye on the clock, and we’re ready to start.”Sounds good, I thought.  I glanced at the empty chairs.She walked around the perimeter of the room, stopping when she stood behind one of the empty chairs.  “Let me recap for our visitor and remind the rest of the group what I said at the start of the first session.  This particular type of group therapy focuses on self-reflection, effective socializing, supporting each other, helping to problem solve, and examining the patterns we fall into, both the constructive and the problematic.  Each of you has spent some time with me working on these things, and this is the platform where we put a lot of that into practice.”“My role in this, Victoria, is to be the referee and the coach.  I’ll try to ensure everyone gets their turn and has a voice.  I’ll try to head off or steer the discussion if it gets into less constructive territory, and to keep things moving if needed.  I’ll be chiming in periodically to ensure that confidentiality is stressed.  I’ve had Victoria review the same materials I gave the rest of you.”I nodded.“While I can promise you confidentiality on my part, and while I’ll encourage you all to maintain it, I can’t guarantee it.  If any of you were to pursue villainous activities, the other members of the group could be compelled to testify against you.  ”The final member of the group entered the room.  She was somewhere between eighteen and twenty, but her height might have been deceiving.  Her white hair was long enough to reach the small of her back, her irises especially pale or similarly white, and she wore a black dress with a dozen straps overlapping in an intricate way at the shoulders and back.  The hem of the dress was damaged at one end.  Threads frayed, polyester melted, with a noticeable hole in it.“Hi, boss,” Kenzie said, a twinkle of mischief in her eye as Mrs. Yamada gave her a stern look.“I’m glad you could make it, Ashley,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “I’ve spent the last minute or two going over the basics, reminding others about the aims of the group and how confidentiality works in a group session.”“To fill in our guest?” ‘Ashley’ asked.  She went straight to the table at the side of the room where a pitcher of water and paper cups were arranged, pouring herself a glass.“Yes.  Her name is Victoria.  If you’ll take a seat, I’ll bring you anything else you need, but I’d like for everyone to be seated so I can continue.”Ashley walked around behind me and circled the perimeter of the group to reach one of the empty seats.  She swept her hand behind her to brush her dress to one side, so it wouldn’t bunch up awkwardly beneath her as she took a seat on one of the two chairs between Rain and Chris.She stared at me.  Maybe it would have been better to say she stared me down.I, meanwhile, was left to digest the mistake of Mrs. Yamada’s that I was here to help address.  I was ninety-five percent sure I knew who ‘Ashley’ was when she was in costume, and I was left to take that knowledge and see how it fit together with the issue at hand.Mrs. Yamada continued, “Use your own discretion when deciding what to share.  You’ve all agreed to participate, knowing the risks and difficulties inherent.  I’m hopeful this will be a positive set of exercises.  I think that more or less sums it up.  I suspect Victoria’s presence and the fact you’ve all had a week to think about what we talked about last session means you’ll have some questions.”“It’s pretty late to be bringing her in,” Ashley said.  “Is she joining the group?”“We hadn’t planned on her joining, per se,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “I invited her because she’s exceptionally well equipped to address the topics that came up last session. We’ll build on it and you can decide what you’re willing to share here.  During our next and final session, depending on your comfort levels and how much you want to carry on today’s discussion, she may or may not be in attendance, or not for the full duration.”“Is it really an ‘issue’?” Tristan asked, making air quotes.“I think it could be.  Victoria can expand on why, shortly.”“Are we supposed to know who she is?” Ashley asked.I glanced at Mrs. Yamada.  She was taking her seat between Ashley and Chris.  From the gesture in my direction, and the fact that she wasn’t stepping in, the ‘referee’ was leaving the ball in my court.“I’m Victoria Dallon.  If you study Parahumans, my family comes up, because it’s a literal textbook case of powers running in families.  I… believe you’ve run into my family, Ashley.”“Have I?  I’ve met so many capes it’s hard to keep track.”“Do you know New Wave?” I asked.  “White bodysuits, symbols in colors?”“I know a few people like that.  I didn’t always pay attention to names.”“Would’ve been in Boston.  The slang term in the ‘scene’ was the Boston Games.”Ashley smiled for the first time.For the rest of the room, I explained, keeping half of an eye on Mrs. Yamada, to make sure I wasn’t overstepping.  “A series of arrests in Boston saw a shift in the power balance of local gangs.  That’s a pretty common thing, but the Protectorate team followed up on it hard, toppling just about every major and most minor gangs and villains in the city, leaving a void that was bigger than usual.  Villains of every power level and stripe flocked to the city, villains in neighboring cities had a vested interest in having a foothold there as a place to retreat to or a place to expand, and it became an entangled nightmare of villain politics and power plays.”“Time of my life,” Ashley said.“Heroes, like the PRT, and like my family’s team, followed, to try and keep the peace until things settled.  My family’s team was Lady Photon, Manpower, Flashbang, Brandish, Lightstar and Fleur.”“The heroes without masks,” Ashley said.“Yeah,” I said.“I remember them.  I was one of the villains who flocked,” Ashley said.That confirmed that she was Damsel of Distress then.  B-list villain, chronic headache for the PRT of yesteryear, unpredictable, dangerous, unstable, and fortunately, she’d been more of a problem for herself than for others.  She had been recruited by the Slaughterhouse Nine, to pad their numbers, and had died shortly after.Her history was one of self-sabotage punctuated by events every two or three years where she was cause for alarm.  She had thrived during the Boston Games, in a sense, enough to get her name out there to capes in Northeastern America as a just in case.She’d later found a place in the Nine.  She was of a particular brand or species of cape, who somehow rose up when everything else was sinking.  It almost made a degree of sense, then, that in following with that pattern, she’d risen up from the grave at the same time the entire world was plunged into chaos.Kenzie was saying something, and I was having trouble tuning in.Slaughterhouse Nine meant Bonesaw.  Crawler.  That in turn led me to think about my last coherent, me moments, the blank in my memories, the aftermath.  It made me think about actual monsters,  and the very real possibility that Ashley was one.“Were you there?”It took me a second to connect with Ashley’s question.“If you’re uncomfortable getting into it, we could change the subject,” Mrs. Yamada said.“Could I just get some water, actually?  Sorry, you meant Boston, Ashley?”“Yes.  During the Boston Games,” Ashley said, as Mrs. Yamada stood and went to get the water.“I was a little too young.  I followed along back at home, where we made the dining room into a kind of headquarters, putting up a few bulletin boards.  I colored in the maps and moved pins as the territories changed hands while doing homework and stuff.  Is it a problem?”“No,” Ashley said.“What are your thoughts on the subject, Victoria?”  Mrs. Yamada asked, handing me the water.I drank before answering.“It’s fine.  Boston was mostly fine,” I said.  “My family didn’t get hurt.  To me, she was just a pin on the map of Boston we had in the living room-”I saw Damsel’s expression shift.  A slight narrowing of the eyes.“-And a few interesting and impressive stories my aunt, uncle, and dad brought home.”That amended the narrowing.  Lesson learned.“Good,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “I’m glad to hear that.  Questions, thoughts, observations?  Anyone?”Ashley wasn’t done with the questions and comments.  The words she spoke next were an accusation, and she was very good at sounding accusatory.  “You brought her here to change our minds.”⊙Our conversation stalled as a waitress wiped down a table behind Jessica.  I swished the ice around my now mostly empty glass.“I never liked the codenames,” Jessica said.“We might be very different people in that.  There’s something fun about them.  They’re revealing.”“They are, but they often reveal just how badly the patient wants to escape, to leave their humanity behind and dive into something well beyond humanity.  Some don’t surface completely.  Some hurt others on the way down.  Some drown in that vast, incomprehensible sea.”I drew in a deep breath, then sighed.  “Feeling poetic?”“My own kind of escapism, maybe.  I think sometimes about a world where all of my patients can go by their real names.”“I’m not following the train of thought, I’m afraid.”“I arranged the group therapy.  I thought for a long time about whether any of my patients were a significant danger to the others, or if they’d set the therapy of their peers back.  I took precautions, I pored over the notes, trying to visualize how things might go, or the topics that I could safely broach or go back to.  Like I said, the first meetings are hard.”“Yeah.  I can imagine that.”“And while I don’t like the way the idea is often interpreted or the conclusions it’s taken to, there’s the notion of volatility, and the exponentially increasing chance of trouble as the groups of capes grow larger.  With parahumans, things are often exaggerated, both in weak points or the hot button issues they have, or their inclination to push certain buttons.  The more you put in one place, the higher the chance of the wrong button being pushed.  That was another concern of mine.”I nodded.  “How long has the group been running?”“Two months and a week, with one or two sessions a week, as situations allow.  We’re not quite at the end, but it’s close.  This was supposed to be the easy middle stretch.”“Supposed to be?  You let your guard down?”“In a way.  Maybe from the beginning,” Jessica said.She looked genuinely bothered.  I held my tongue.She went on, “I spent so much time anticipating and planning for disaster, that I failed to see the other side of that coin.  I didn’t want to think of them as capes.  I sought out the things that would help them connect and find reasons to listen to one another.”I realized what had happened.Jessica was nodding to herself.  “That was my mistake.  We were approaching the end stretch, and I reminded them of the date we would wrap up and finish.  The conversation took a turn, and I was caught flat-footed.  They expressed interest in staying together.  They want to found a team.”“A team of?”“Heroes, it sounds like.”“Is that so bad?” I asked.“Without going into any particular detail, Victoria, several are troubled, vulnerable, or both.  No, I don’t think it’s good.”                                                                                             Flare – 2.6                                                                                           “It’s not my intent to change your minds,” I said.  I could see some skeptical looks on some faces as I looked around the circle.  “I’m here to give another perspective, and maybe to equip you guys with knowledge.  If you change your minds because of that- and I think Mrs. Yamada might be hoping for that, then that’s fine.  If not, then I’d hope you were all going into this with your eyes more open about what you’re doing.”“I’ve  addressed my feelings with the group,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “At the end of the session where the topic first came up, and for a portion of the last session.  We had other things demanding our attention, so we weren’t able to cover it in any depth.”“That would be me,” Rain said, raising a hand.Jessica continued, “To abbreviate what I said then, and to reinforce it in the here and now: if you each carried on as you have been until the final group sessions concluded, then moved on from there with the skills and perspective you’ve gained, I think most of you would do fine.  Most of you have reached the points in your journeys where you could continue on your own, without needing the one-on-one therapy or the group sessions.  You could pursue more conventional therapy, I think anyone could, and you would have my number in case of emergencies or backsliding, but most of you would do fine.”“Ready to be let loose into the urban wilds,” Chris said.“Not all of us though,” Kenzie said.  “You said most, a few times.”“Most,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “I also had private discussions with several members of the group.  I won’t say what was discussed, or with whom, but no, I don’t think everyone is ready.”The group was silent. I assumed nobody wanted to speak up because they felt like doing so would out them as one of the people who’d had one of those private conversations.Mrs. Yamada went on, “More to the point, beyond any and all of that, I don’t think the group would necessarily be healthy, taken outside of this setting and function.”“You gathered us together so we could support each other,” Sveta said. “I feel like we do a good job of that. We bring out the good sides of one another.”“In this setting, yes, I have seen that,” Jessica said. “I’m gratified it’s been so positive for most of you. But that’s in a controlled setting, with a mediator to keep things on course and help recognize the sensitive subjects and steer away from them.”“May I?” I asked.“Please,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “Feel free.”“To build on what you said, I think the things I’ve noticed on the those fronts are that, well, it’s a big leap from the controlled setting of a place like this to the wild, uncontrolled setting of superheroics. Things will get bad at some point, and when they do, there’s a tendency for the bad to snowball.”“You lived in Brockton Bay,” Tristan said. “Is it possible your sense of normal is skewed?”“That’s- that’s honestly hard to respond to,” I said.  I didn’t miss the flicker of a smile on Tristan’s face at hearing that.  “Because there’s an answer that springs to mind that I could give you, but I don’t know where people’s limits are, I don’t want to step on toes or upset anyone by giving an example.”“I don’t know about the others, but I can’t think of what you’d say that would potentially upset us,” Tristan said.“I can,” Rain said.I raised an eyebrow.Rain leaned forward, elbows on his knees.  “I’m making a pretty big leap here, but it’s the response that jumped to mind for me, too.  I’ve been here from the start, I think I know where everyone’s at.  I think it’s okay to say it, but do you mean Gold Morning?  I could see where it would be sensitive, considering just about everyone lost someone, but I don’t think that’s going to push anyone in particular over the edge, here.”“Yeah.  That was it, thank you,” I said.  I looked past Sveta to Tristan.  “What happened in Brockton Bay wasn’t a break from the pattern.  It was just the pattern playing out at an accelerated rate.  What I’m talking about, the snowballing, the bad things happening and then compounding each other… they still happened.  A whole lot of individual factors played into the events of that day, and into the engagements and infighting that followed.”“When they happen more slowly, there’s time to rest,” Sveta said.“When they happen slowly, there’s time to get used to the bad, to normalize it.  You or people you thought you knew change in reaction to those external factors without anyone realizing it and… things still compound.  The bad days come, and the unresolved stuff from the last bad days catches up or demands resolution.”“Like Gold Morning, again,” Rain said.  “A lot of things caught up with us around then.  Or a lot of things converged to bring it about, maybe.  I wasn’t there so I don’t know.”“I was only there for the later parts,” I said.  “But I think you’re right.”“Things are better this time,” Sveta said.  “We’ve learned from mistakes.  It’s a fresh start.  The Endbringers are dormant, we’re finally building things without them being torn down all the time.”“I agree with Sveta,” Tristan said.  “I really think there is a lot of work to be done before we get to a good normal, but that’s where I want to be out there doing some of that work in the best way I know how, with people I’ve come to know, like, and respect.”“I don’t like being on the opposite side of an argument from you, Victoria,” Sveta said.  “It doesn’t feel good.”I reached out for her hand.  She met me halfway, putting the prosthetic hand in mine.  I squeezed it, realized she might not be able to feel the squeeze, and gave it a waggle.  She smiled.“No hard feelings, okay?” I said.  “I get it.  You want this.  Believe me when I say I want to get out and do some heroic stuff too.”“I have a boyfriend I feel like I don’t deserve, and please don’t use that as a launchpad to get into another topic, Mrs. Yamada.”“I’m keeping my mouth shut for the time being,” Mrs. Yamada said.Sveta nodded.  She looked back at me.  “I missed out on most of my teenage years, I don’t remember my childhood, and I feel so behind.”“I know.  Believe me, I get it, not to the same degree, but I share some of those same feelings,” I said.“I know you do,” she said.  She gave me a waggle back.“I think more than a few of us get it,” Tristan said.  “Losing years or losing time because we have to deal with shit other people don’t, and falling behind because of it.”Sveta nodded.  “My boyfriend is out and around and he’s doing great work.  He’s been doing it for a while.  He tried to build something with the Irregulars and it went bad.  But now he’s out there again and he’s with the team, the top team I know about, he’s doing amazing stuff.  I don’t know if I can ever catch up, but I don’t want to not try.  I don’t want to let the gap widen.”“It can’t be just about him, you know,” I said.  “I think that would be more poison than help for a relationship.”“It’s not.  Well, I mean, it is, but it’s not about him in a him-and-me romantic sense, it’s about me and him- sorry, I’m not making sense.”“I’m following okay,” I said.Mrs. Yamada said, “Just take your time, find the words.”“Back long before I even knew him, he was my reference point for figuring out where we are.  We being the C-fifty-threes.  If he was popular then we all had a shot at getting more popularity.  That was something I could hope I could have one day.  And I didn’t have a lot of hope, so it was important.”I reached over, and gave her arm a solid pat.  I was still holding her hand.“And we spent part of the summer touring other worlds.  We were looking for our places of birth, but mostly we were looking for mine.  I’m one of the only ones who remembers mine.”She moved one hand over to tap a finger against her forearm.  In dark green, almost invisible as a series of dark green images between dark blue sky and dark blue waves, framed by leaping fish in neon orange, were a series of huts.“I was waiting for some updates on my body and so we just had me in my hamster ball, and Weld is so great, so patient… but I don’t like being that dependent.  I want to be self-sufficient and I want to do it by being a hero.”“I think that’s kind of the opposite of the toxic path,” Tristan said.  “You’ve talked about it before, Sveta, how you’re worried about how your world revolves around him.”Sveta nodded.  “When you’re disabled, and I see myself as disabled, then your world gets smaller.  Things get harder.  It’s easy to become dependent or let down your guard.  Everything’s hard and it’s really easy to stop trying altogether, to rely on people who want to help, to do what Victoria said and normalize that behavior and let the toxicity seep into things, only to have it come to a head during an already bad day.”“I’m just going to cut in here,” I said.  “I one hundred percent think what you’re saying is cool and good.  It’s a good mindset.  I did catch one thing you said and it made me think.  You said ‘self-sufficient’ and one of the things I was thinking about mentioning was, you know, heroing is hard, and it’s kind of hard in part because it doesn’t pay.  That can lead to self-insufficiency instead.”“It can pay,” Tristan said.“It can,” I said.  “But it paid in part because people wanted to put money toward it.  Because the governments backed it and put money into the PRT, which paid the heroes a decent wage with opportunities for more.  I spent my entire life seeing my mom stressing out in front of the computer or in front of the paperwork, from the time I could walk to the time I went to the hospital.”“It can absolutely pay, though,” Tristan said.  He glanced at Mrs. Yamada and then said, “I was a member of a corporate team, I saw and participated in the fundraising and merchandising, and we did well.  We made a good bit of money.”“Which team?” I asked.“Reach.”“Oh, kudos.  I know Reach,” I said.  “I’m not sure I could list off the roster as of Gold Morning but I’m more than passingly familiar.  Good team.”“Thank you,” Tristan said.  “I mean, I’m not so worried about the money.  That’s the easy part.”“I don’t think it’s easy at all,” I said.  “There’s a saying, um, seventy percent of couples break up because of financial issues.  The same number of cape teams break up because of the same.”“What’s so hard about it?” Sveta asked.“You’re providing a service, and the fruits of that service aren’t immediately tangible.  If you do everything right, get crime rates down, clean up the neighborhood, then people look at the clean streets and low crime rate and they wonder why they’re paying you.  If the crime rate stays high and things are a mess, then they wonder why they’re paying you.”“How do you get around that?” Chris asked.“You show your work,” I said.  “And you show it in a way that makes people believe you’re doing a good job.  Bringing in bad guys, getting on the front page, that’s a big one, but you have to factor in the work of maintaining a relationship with the media, marketing, on top of the work you’re already doing.  You can also get into fights the public is aware of, while not putting that public in danger, because putting people in danger means getting sued.”“Which detracts from the finances,” Chris said.“In a big way,” I said.“Like prison rep,” Ashley said.  “Having to show you’re not to be messed with, without making such a mess that you add to your sentence.”“Yes,” I said.  “Not an analogy I would have jumped to, but it’s a good one.”“I wasn’t aware you went to prison,” Sveta said.“I didn’t,” Ashley said, fixing Sveta with a level stare.  “I watch tv and read books.”I was going to reply to that, but Tristan was already talking.  He said, “I’m not worried about the money side of things.  P.R., rep, image, media, I had advice and lessons from masters in the field, when it came to that.”“From what I remember of Reach, I believe you,” I said.  “I do think that there’s a ton of difference between launching a new team and capitalizing on an established brand like Reach had, and between being the man in front of the cameras and the person in the background paying the bills.”“I have to ask,” Ashley said.  She waited for me to look at her before speaking.  “What are your qualifications exactly?  You were on a struggling team?”“I don’t want to bully Victoria, please,” Sveta said.I was feeling the numbers disadvantage, with many things I was saying having two people responding, a number of changes in direction, and the periodic challenging questions.  Mrs. Yamada hadn’t spoken up recently.“I’m a cape geek,” I said.“We’re all cape geeks,” Tristan said.  “It comes with the territory of being a cape.”“Then I’m a cape geek of a tier higher,” I said.  “Listen, my mom and dad were capes and they were talking shop around me since I was born.  My aunt, uncle, cousins- my entire immediate and pretty much my whole extended family, they were all capes.  I was giving interviews about what it was like to grow up with hero parents when I was ten.”Tristan cut in, “Okay, but that doesn’t-”“Hold on,” I said.  “I was asked, I’m answering.  I triggered at fourteen, I was patrolling within six months.  I had three years of time as Glory Girl, one Endbringer fight, and-”I paused.Sveta squeezed my hand.“-And one run-in with the Slaughterhouse Nine, followed by almost two years in the hospital.”I glanced at Ashley.  She hadn’t flinched at the mention of the Nine.I went on, “I’ve seen some of the worst.  I had the best boyfriend in the world-”“You had the second best,” Sveta said.  “I’ll fight you on this.”“I’ll take you up on that another time,” I said.  I smiled.  “Some of my family members were some of the most amazing people, one of those family members is still with me, and I count myself lucky in that.  I was a local celebrity, and I got letters from kids saying they were inspired or I’d improved their lives by reaching out to them, spending a bit of time with them, or helping them off a bad path through nothing more than me existing.  With all of that, I think I can say I’ve experienced some of the best that being a hero has to offer, too.”“What happened to the others?” Kenzie asked.  “The other family members?”“Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “It’s best to leave that be.”“Okay,” Kenzie said.  “I didn’t mean to pry.  I’m really sorry, Victoria, for your losses.  I asked because I’ve lost people too.  I know it hurts, and I think you’re cool and you don’t deserve that hurt.”“Thank you, Kenzie.  I’ll share, because I think it’s important for context.  We’ve all lost people and that’s a big part of our shared experience here on Earth Gimel.”I saw people throughout the room nodding, or acknowledging that.  Interesting, to see the lone wolf villainess Ashley nod, too.  Chris, Tristan, Sveta.  Mrs. Yamada.Rain was hard to read, but he looked introspective.“My uncle, my cousin, and that awesome boyfriend, Leviathan, twenty-eleven.  My- another family member, you could say she got herself.  Or you could say the team dynamics, all that stuff I was talking about before, they played a role.  I wasn’t paying enough attention, I let things pass by without remark when I should have pressed, pressed when I should have held back.  And now she’s- she’s not family.  My mom, recently, just…”I sighed.“I’m not here to be a downer,” I said.  “I’m really not.  I do want to emphasize this isn’t a game.  There’s a chance at greatness and there’s a chance, maybe a higher chance, of disaster.  I experienced both.”“Not to belittle that, but each and every one of us has gone through shit,” Tristan said.  “If it’s supposed to be one part of good stuff for every ten parts bad, then I think most of us are owed some good stuff.”“I don’t think it’s supposed to be that way,” I said.  “Ashley asked who I am.  I’m a cape, born, raised, and learned.  I’m a student of capes, I obsessed over them well before I had powers and I stepped up my game in a professional capacity after I got powers.  I had date nights with my cape boyfriend where I studied and read his Wards handbook, because that’s how into it I was.  I’ve followed the trajectories of two hundred cape careers and I’ve been part of a team trying to get off the ground.  I looked seriously into what it would take to start a team back when my boyfriend was getting close to leaving the Wards, because I was worried he’d get moved to another city.”I looked Ashley in the eyes.  “This is me.  I know cape stuff.  I know what goes into it and I know what comes from it.”I looked at Tristan.  “The last thing it is, is fair.  You’re not owed anything.  If you roll the dice nine times and get bad results every time, you don’t have a better shot on the tenth roll because of that.”“But,” Tristan said, and he said it with a bit of theatrical emphasis and a light in his eyes that made me really believe he had that experience in being in front of cameras and showing off for crowds.  He was more into things as he continued, “You have a better shot at getting an optimal result if you roll the dice a lot, than you would if you rolled it a couple of times, get bad results, and quit.  You have to get back up after you get knocked down.  You have to.”“Or stand up in the first place,” Sveta said.“Or stand up in the first place, yeah,” Tristan said. He glanced at Mrs. Yamada, then back to me.  “What you were talking about earlier, with Sveta and it being toxic to not stretch yourself out enough, it applies here.”“I’m sorry to interrupt,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “Tristan, can I ask why you keep looking to me?  It’s not a usual habit.”“Oh,” Tristan said.  “I barely noticed.  I think I’m pretty used to you jumping in to tell me to back down or not get so into an argument.”“I see,” Mrs. Yamada said.“I guess the fact that I’m checking means I’m already aware I’m doing it again, and I should self-moderate.  Back down on my own instead of being told to.”“Look at that, Pavlov’s dog can ring his own bell now,” Chris said.“I’m all about the goats, thank you very much,” Tristan said.  He touched a more pronounced lock of his magenta hair.  “See, like the curling horns of a ram, right?”Chris rolled his eyes.Team Reach and goats?  “You’re Capricorn?” I asked.“I am,” Tristan said.  “Bonus point for you.”Kenzie, though, piped up with,”I like the hair-horns thing, Tristan.  I never got it before now but I think it’s neat.”“Thank you, Kenzie,” Tristan said.  “This is part of why you’re awesome.”Kenzie’s expression didn’t change much, but she had one leg crossed over the other, and the free-dangling foot bounced.  Like a dog wagging its tail.Chris said, “Getting an ‘I like it’ from Kenzie is like getting a participation medal from a school event.  Everyone gets one.”“That doesn’t make it worthless,” Kenzie said.  She flashed a smile at Chris.  “I never lie, I’m always honest when I say I like something.  What makes me different is that I say it instead of keeping it to myself, because I think the world needs more positivity.”“I like it,” Rain said.  “I could never do it, because it takes a weird sort of social courage, but I like it.”“Thank you,” Kenzie said.“I think you lose this round, Chris,” Tristan said.“How do I lose?  I wasn’t playing.”“And,” Tristan said.  Again, that one word, almost a pronouncement, volume and emphasis shifted just a bit to get attention.  “On the topic of rounds and games, I feel like Mrs. Yamada is up to something, so I’m going to play this on a meta level and I’m going to shut myself up.  I recognize I’ve been trying to win this conversation with Victoria and I’ve been monopolizing things by jumping in every time there’s an opportunity.  I’m supposed to be listening more and trying to ‘win’ social interactions less, so I’m going to shut myself up.  The others should chime in, I trust them to say what needs to be said.”“I’m proud of you, Tristan,” Mrs. Yamada said.Tristan nodded.Rain said, “I’m less proud and more amazed by the fact that your thought process went from ‘I need to try to win social interactions less’ to ‘this is a meta-scenario I can win’ in, what, twenty words?”“What, did I?”“And the fact he used so many words to say he was going to shut up,” Chris said.Tristan frowned at Chris.  “You guys are harsh.”“It’s what we’re here for, isn’t it?” Sveta asked.  “We moderate each other.  Hopefully while not being too harsh on each other.”“It’s part of it,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “I think the ‘participation award’ comment was a little much, Chris.  You have a tendency, which has been remarked on by others in the past, to think a clever put-down is a good thing because it’s clever, when most people will take away the fact it was a put-down.”“Alright,” Chris said.  “I didn’t think it was a good or bad thing.  Sorry Kenzie.”He didn’t sound very sorry, but Kenzie’s dangling foot wiggled, and she nodded, wiggling slightly in her seat a bit between the motions.Mrs. Yamada said, “The reason I’ve been somewhat quiet, despite my referee role, is more or less what Tristan intuited.  I’ve done this in the past – taking more of a backseat, giving you all more of an opportunity to respond to one another and push back against one another rather than relying on me to keep things under control.  In the early stages, I had to step in rather quickly.  I’m glad that with minimal prompting, Tristan stopped himself before reaching the point where I had to tell him to stop.”“We’re being toyed with,” Ashley said.“Not that,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “The end goal is to get you all ready for the real world.  Early on, the rudder needed a firm hand; as time goes on, I’m periodically hands off, seeing how you interact, until I see that you’re faring reasonably well on your own.  It’s a gradual process that requires I give you more and more trust.  Okay?”Ashley nodded.“It might be worth pausing to take stock in this moment.  Snapshot the feelings and thoughts you’re experiencing.  Some of you haven’t spoken up much at all.  Depending on how you view the conversation, your participation or nonparticipation, some of you might be feeling frustrated, offended, worried, or even guilty.”“Is that last one aimed at me?” Tristan asked.  “Oh, wait, sorry, I’m supposed to have shut up.”“It’s not aimed at you, Tristan,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “I want each of you to think about where you stand right now.  What are your feelings and where is your focus?  Have you felt like you’ve had a voice or that you’ve taken things in a positive direction?  Outside of the classroom, in a stressful situation with high stakes, these feelings could be magnified manifold.  As Victoria suggested when she was talking about the slow progression of background negativity, the bad feelings aren’t always resolved or solved, and it would be very easy for a sliver of frustration to carry forward, nettling at you or being joined by other, similar feelings, until you felt compelled to do or say something you regret.”“Handing that irritation off to someone else,” I said.“Yes,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “And, as a final comment on the topic from me, I brought Victoria here for several reasons.  One of them is that I do believe she knows what she’s talking about.  Another is that, from my position as a person with a measure of trust and power, with a strong feeling about what you’re committed to doing, it’s very difficult for me to both argue the points and also manage the discussion at the same time.  If I tell Tristan to give others a chance to speak, it could be seen as me trying to shut down his side of the argument.”“I’m here as a bit of a surrogate,” I said.  “I’m here saying what you can’t.”“In part.  I think we do disagree on some things.”“Like the value and importance we place in cape names, to quote a recent example,” I said.  “I like them, you don’t.”“Yes.  I did, for the record, let Victoria know I would be sitting back more than usual.”“You did.  I didn’t expect to be ganged up on, though.”“I’m sorry about that.”“It was mild,” I said.“I don’t want to gang up on Victoria.  I’ve done a lot of talking too,” Sveta said.  “But I think that’s because I know Victoria, even if this is our first time really talking properly.  There’s a bit of trust.”I nodded.  “Yep.”“For what it’s worth,” Sveta said, “that trust means that much like Mrs. Yamada I do believe Victoria when she says she’s worried or she thinks this could go badly.  I know she knows stuff.  But I do want this.  I want to stand on my own two feet.  Sorry.  I think the ones who’ve been quiet up until now should say stuff.  Ashley, Chris, Kenzie, Rain.  Or, you know, maybe Victoria has more to say.”“Thank you for coming, by the way, Victoria,” Kenzie said.“You’re welcome,” I said.  “I do want this to be a chance to share what I know and for you guys to gain, if that’s possible.  Maybe there are places where you might realize there are gaps in your knowledge that you could then take time to brush up on.  There isn’t a rush.”“There is, kind of,” Rain said.Heads turned.“I talked about this last session.  There’s currently some people after me.  I want to be part of a team because it’s backup.  Having a squad of people with me when I’m out and about would throw a wrench into their plans.  It could give me a fighting chance when I wouldn’t have one otherwise.”“People are after you?” I asked.Rain held up his fingers in a way that made a rectangle.  “It’s complicated.”The rectangle was supposed to represent the card.I smiled despite myself.  “And these guys are okay with taking the risk involved there?”“I’m not scared,” Ashley said.“I’m breaking my vow of silence again,” Tristan said, “But I think I’m doing it for the right reasons here.  I like, respect, and/or trust each of these guys who would be my teammates.  But in particular, I consider Rain a friend.  I’m already willing to throw my helmet into the ring and do what it takes to help save his life.  We’ve got some similar garbage going on with… people we can’t get away from, and he’s had my back in the past when it came to my issue.”“Yes,” Rain said.  He gestured vaguely toward his head.“People?” I asked.“Speaking for myself, I’m part of a multitrigger cluster,” Rain said.“Oh,” I said.  I paused, taking stock of that.  “I can see where that warrants playing the ‘complicated’ card.”Kenzie spoke up, “Before you got in, Ashley, Victoria was saying we should all get a card saying ‘it’s complicated’ on the one side, and ‘handle with care’ on the other.  I wanted to make sure you got what they were talking about.”“I like that,” Ashley said.  “It could use rewording.  ‘Do not fuck with’, instead of handling with care.”“Reminds me of the old wiki entries,” Capricorn said, “The red warning boxes for the scary capes.”“Did I have one?” Ashley asked.“You did,” I said.Ashley nodded.  “Good.”Was it?  I decided to leave it alone.“You were motioning toward your head before,” I said, to Rain.  “Are you referring to bleed-over, kiss and kill?  That sort of thing?”“Huh,” Rain said.  “You weren’t lying when you were saying you’d studied up.”I’d pulled my hand away from Sveta’s at one point, and I only realized it because she reached out and took my hand again, placing her hand over mine and giving it a congratulatory squeeze.“Is it part of it?” I asked.“I don’t know, honest to God,” Rain said.  “When I’m vague and I’m saying it’s complicated, it’s really because I can’t give a one hundred percent clear answer.  I’m still figuring out the rules this works by.  I’ve wondered about the bleeding through.  My personality changed after, but I don’t know how much of that is them and how much is how a trigger event is a wake-up call.”“We like to give things hard labels, but sometimes they’re blurry around the edges,” I said.Rain nodded.“If your own cluster is coming after you, I’d say you could chalk it up to kiss and kill.  Again, blurry, might as well throw it in that bucket.”“I won’t object,” Rain said.“And while I’m on that subject, I’d feel compelled to stress that the term uses the word ‘kill’ for a reason.”“Yeah,” Rain said.“People die.  Friends of people die.  I’m still figuring out what you guys are doing, but… you want to bring kids into that?” I asked.  I looked over to my right, at Kenzie and Chris.“Definitely not,” Rain said.  “Tristan is saying he’d help, Ashley is offering a hand, and Sveta might do what she can?  That’s a hell of a lot better, compared to the same circumstance with me alone.”“There’s more peace of mind in talking to legitimate authorities,” I said.“There is,” Rain said.  “If things get bad, I’ll go to them.  I’ve tested the waters and asked questions.  It doesn’t seem like they’ll offer help against a nebulous threat with an unclear window of time where it might occur, and villains  I don’t know the names, locations or details of.  It’s more like they want me to call them when I’ve got a claw at my throat.”“Everyone’s busy,” Tristan said.“Claw?” I asked.  “Tinker claw?”That got the room’s attention.“You’re thinking of the man with the tinker arms you ran into at the community center, Victoria?” Mrs. Yamada asked.“Yeah,” I said.She explained, “Victoria mentioned that she took him for a multi-trigger, given the powers he displayed and the common links to a woman with claws she’d read about.  I was going to bring it up at the end of the session, to avoid the lengthy digression like we had last session, and I hoped to extend it to a discussion in another venue, possibly with less people.”“I derailed us early, it seems,” I said.“You ran into a member of my cluster?” Rain asked.“Big guy, beard, heavy coat.”“Long hair, hood, rough voice,” Rain said, “And a glare, like if looks could kill.”“No hood, glare… I don’t know.  He wore a mask with a built in glare, but he seemed like the scowly type.  Definitely on the voice.”“Of course,” Rain said.  “When did you fight him?”“When?” I asked.  “Um.  Thirteen days ago.  First Monday of September.  High school had just started.”Rain held up one hand, counting on his fingers, his lips moving.“Why?” I asked.“Timing matters.”  It was Tristan who had replied, while Rain was busy counting.“He was strong then,” Rain said, finishing his counting and dropping his hands.“He was a bit of a bastard, if I’m being honest,” I said.  “Not fun to go up against.  He’s one of the ones who was after you?”Rain nodded.“Why the counting?”“It’s complicated,” Rain said.  He must have seen the look on my face, because he added, “The powers wax, wane, and shuffle around.  I try to keep track.  He was loaded to bear on that day, if I’m remembering right.  The only power he didn’t have a lot of was mine, and maybe a little bit less of his own.”“Right,” I said.  “Which is yours?”“Uh.  Mine is a blaster power,” Rain said.  “It’s pretty mediocre.  I shoot things or people and they’re vulnerable to being broken for a short while after.  To put it simply.”“Mediocre is sort of the name of the game when it comes to clusters,” I said.“I’ve got a tinker power, I make extra arms and hands.  They’re not very good.  Barely above what I’d be able to make on my own, fragile enough that if you grab something wrong they can break, no strength, ugly.  The prosthetic focus is part of why I was introduced to the group, I think.”“It was,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “We thought there was a chance of insights across designs.”Sveta would be one, obviously.  Ashley raised a hand, slender, with black-painted nails.I couldn’t tell that her hand was prosthetic.“I wasn’t much help, because I’m a really bad tinker,”  Rain said.  “I can also catch my balance or secure my footing more easily, that’s my version of the big guy’s mover power.  It’s handy in a way, lets me turn on a dime or keep from falling over.”“Wait, his power was the mover power?  The arms and emotion power were his secondaries?” I asked.“That’s what I’m saying,” Rain said.  “I think he had a bit less of his own power that day, with the way it was sorted.  My last power is an emotion power.  Guilt and doubt, over an area.  It’s pretty tepid.”“He hit me with it a few times,” Tristan said.  “Tepid is a good word for it.  You can actually not notice you’re being hit by it.”“And it waxes and wanes, you said?” I asked.“My blaster power can get a bump some days.  My others, no.  They stay at about that power level.  The others change it up more, they’ll act on days they’re strong.”“We may be getting distracted,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “I might suggest you carry on this discussion later.  Victoria can fill you in on…”“Snag,” I said.  “Sorry.  This is actually really interesting though.  I’d be happy to talk it over another time.”“It’s good to have a name for him,” Rain said.  “Uh, okay.  Getting back on topic, I know I’m a little selfish in why I’m doing this.  Wanting people to have my back.”“We all need people to have our backs,” Kenzie said.“Yeah,” Rain said.  “It’s still selfish.  It’s messy and I’m not sure I can pull my own weight with all of this.  I do want to help people though.  I’ve been selfish for a long time.  I’m trying to be better.  I know I’m contradicting myself in what I’m doing here, but it makes sense to me, and so few things do.”“You said-” Kenzie started.  “Oh, are you done, Rain?”“I’m done.  Pretty much where I’m at.  I’ll buy you a coffee or whatever you drink, Victoria, if you’ll tell me about Snag.”“Sure.”“You said you had info about hero teams, Victoria,” Kenzie said.  “And I’m interested in that because I do want to try to be a hero first.”“First?” I asked.“I’m saying I’ll try, maybe a few times, and if it doesn’t work out I’ll try other things but if it doesn’t work out then I might try being a mercenary, or a villain.”“You would be terrifying as shit if you were a villain,” Chris said.“Would I?  Is that a compliment?” Kenzie asked.“Yes,” Ashley said.“No,” Chris said.  “It’s a neutral fact, and I don’t use the word terrifying lightly.”“Be fair, Chris,” Mrs. Yamada said.“I’m being fair.  This is an objective fact,” Chris said.“And be gentle, too.  If you must levy a criticism-”“Fact.”“-there are nicer ways to say it.”“Got it,” Chris said.Kenzie stuck out her tongue at him.“Terrifying is good,” Ashley said.  “Terrifying slows the other guy down.  It makes them make mistakes.”“You’re not wrong,” I said.  “I’ve used that to my advantage-”“And it’s fun,” Ashley said.“Ah… I used to think that,” I said.  “I’ve come to reconsider that sentiment.  I regret how I employed it, a little, and I regret enjoying it a lot.”Ashley sighed a little.“We’ve talked about this at some length,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “Here in the group.  The approaches that work.  Fear comes at a cost.”“It does,” I said.  “Not necessarily in the ways you’d expect, pushing people away or any of that.  It makes a mess.  It makes people unpredictable.  I have an awe-fear aura so I’ve seen this at work.”“I almost envy you,” Ashley said.  “To have something you can so casually employ.”“It’s not casual,” I said.  “Because like I said, it’s complicated in terms of the mess it makes of things.  I’ve been trying to be more deliberate about how I use it.”“See, this excites me,” Kenzie said.  “I want to learn from Ashley because I saw the camcorder footage from the Boston Games- I showed you that one right, Ashley?”“You did,” Ashley said.“I’ll get you a copy because you liked it so much.  There’s also a video I don’t think I’ve shown you but it’s mostly you walking through a club with someone and everyone gets out of your way.  That was interesting.”“Do you want people to get out of your way, Kenzie?” Sveta asked.  “I don’t think it’s good or fun.”“Definitely no.  It’s still interesting.  But, um, I also want to learn from Victoria because I do want to be on a team, I want to be on this team of course, but whatever happens I want to be on some team.  Then I want to be useful so I stay there.  The more I know the more useful I can be.”“I am interested in hearing it too,” Sveta said.  “About teams, making heroics work.”“I looked over my schoolwork and some old projects before I came today,” I said.  “I typed up some bullet points and thought hard about what I wanted to say, and… being here, I’m not sure it’s valid.”“It’s valid.  I want to hear it,” Kenzie said.“I would too,” Ashley said.  “It’s why I’m here.”I was caught a little off guard by that.I could remember Ashley’s comments when the topic of the cards had come up.  She’d liked the ‘handle with care’ aspect of it, which was illuminating in its own way.  More specifically, she’d liked it while interpreting it as a ‘do not fuck with’ license.The way it had been framed and what I knew of Ashley and Damsel of Distress made me imagine it as a ‘warning: volatile’ label on her breast, worn much like a nametag.She’d reacted to me belittling her even in a small way, earlier, when I’d reduced her to a pin on a map.“It might be worth saying why you think it isn’t valid,” Mrs. Yamada suggested.I tried to find the words to articulate what I wanted to say without getting on anyone’s bad side, my fingers twirling a lock of hair while I looked down at the floor.  I looked up and looked her in the eyes, then looked at everyone else as I said, “I can come here and I can say, alright, finances.  Being a hero team is tough financially.  I touched on this before.  How do you get funding, one source, many, or is it institutional?  What’s your budget, what can you expect to pay, where are the hidden costs, like medical or needing a headquarters, and what are the potential costs or risks if you decide to save money by trimming the budget somewhere?  And maybe that angle works for some of you.”“It feels abstract,” Sveta said.  “I have a stipend, I pay rent, I have to budget, but when you talk about things in the big picture like that, I find it hard to imagine.”“Budgets and money make more sense when you root them in tangible things that are relevant to you.  If you had questions about one area, I might have more to say about it, or I could expand on the idea, if that was a thing that worked for you guys, as a way to wrap your head around what you’re trying to do.  I could do the same for objectives and goals, information gathering, costumes and presentation, allegiances and direction, liaisons, territories, methodology… one or two others I’m not remembering off the top of my head.  But as far as I can tell, you’re approaching this from several different directions, with very different priorities.”“We definitely are,” Rain said.“I don’t get the impression Ashley is prioritizing developing herself as a person, becoming independent, or catching up in life, like Sveta is.  I don’t get the impression its about becoming less selfish or wanting or needing backup, like Rain.  I’m not sure what someone of your pedigree would be doing here, Ashley.”“Pedigree?” Ashley asked.“It means aristocratic background when used to describe humans,” Chris said.  “She’s not calling you a bred animal.  I’m pretty sure.”“I’m not bothered.  I like the word choice,” Ashley said.  She had half of a smile on her face.“It was picked to be liked,” I said.“I’m here to learn, Victoria,” Ashley said.  Her gaze with the narrow pupils and lack of irises was intense.“That’s positive,” I said.“No it’s not,” Chris said.“I’m here to learn how heroes operate, so I can be more effective against them when I return to being a villain,” Ashley said.I looked at Sveta and Tristan, then at Mrs. Yamada.“She’s not lying,” Tristan said.“It’s positive, really,” Sveta said.  “She’s agreed to stick with us until we crash and burn.”“Until you fail,” Ashley said.“Until we crash and burn,” Sveta said.  “We went over this.  If you leave at the first sign of failure then you’ll be gone in the first week and you won’t have learned anything, and everyone loses.”“Irritating,” Ashley said.“Reality is irritating,” Rain said.“We’re low-key confident we can get her to stick around on the side of the good guys, with sufficient friendship, ass-kicking of our opponents, and time to convince her of the upsides,” Tristan said, to me.“You vastly underestimate how much I enjoy being a villain, Tristan.”“You enjoy being a villain but you don’t like the life that comes with it,” Rain said.“It had its merits,” Ashley said.“Sure,” Rain said.  “And a lot of other misery besides that.”Ashley sighed.  “I’ve already agreed.  I’ll join you.  I’ll defend you from your cluster.  In exchange I learn about heroes, I get information about the cape scene, and I may get training.  If it fails, I’ll go back to what I know and enjoy.  You’ll have your chance to convince me that being a hero is great.  I doubt you’ll succeed.  Most heroes I’ve met have been imbeciles and nuisances.”“Okay,” I said.  I put a hand to my forehead, closing my eyes.  Capes were so damn weird sometimes.“You said it was better than the alternative, before everyone arrived,” Kenzie said.  “Being a hero.”“I did,” I said.  I might be regretting saying that now.  The fact that Kenzie paid attention to what I’d said and was quick enough to bring out the salient points was good, objectively, but it was kind of a pain here.  I could see where some of Mrs. Yamada’s worries were rooted, here.  “You have a strong drive to learn, then, Ashley?”“What I want hasn’t changed.  I want to be on top.  I want to destroy my enemies and give potential enemies a reason to fear me.  I’m going to do it right this time.”This time.  There were four different things I wanted to reply to there, and I settled on the easy one.  “Reports were that you died.”“I did,” she said.  “Now I’m back.  My power isn’t holding me back anymore.”“You get sparky sometimes,” Kenzie said.“So long as my hands are maintained, I’m fine.  I have contacts.  I’m eating well, I’m sleeping, I’m studying and I’m training.  I’ll do it right this time.  I won’t die this time.”“Alright,” I said.  “That pretty much sums up what I’m trying to say here.  You guys have your reasons.  I can’t show you a spreadsheet or make a list that meets your needs because your needs are diverse.  It’s not about hard stats like dollars and viewership.”“It’s about dollars for me,” Tristan said.“Right.  I’ll note you do have a very different idea than I do about how much money there may be,” I said.“Kind of,” Tristan said.  “I don’t know if it’s that different.”The thing I wanted to say that I couldn’t without offending people was that a lot of them were coming at things from an irrational or emotional perspective, from their self, and not from logic.  To challenge Sveta’s approach on this was to challenge the woman she wanted to be.  Challenging Rain meant putting his mortality at risk.  Damsel was too volatile to push too hard, she had her motivations, and I couldn’t imagine scaring her off would do any good to anyone.  The team would go forward without her, dejected and possibly upset with me or with Mrs. Yamada for inviting me.My impression was that Tristan was looking at the money from an abstract, emotional perspective as well.“I barely have a high school education, it’s not like there’s a lot out there for me, and money is tight everywhere,” Tristan said.  “I like the hero stuff.  I like the notoriety, and I like being out there.  We need a fix, and the two ways I see of us getting one would be if we get the money together to pay the right cape, or we chance into meeting the right cape.”“Fix?” I asked.  “Sorry, I missed something.”“With how quick you were about cape terms and names, and how you knew Reach, I thought you might have realized.”“I figured out you’re Capricorn.”“More to it than that.  You know how two brothers can get in a pissy fight over who gets to have the remote and decide what to watch on TV?  We’re stuck doing that, except it’s way more fucking intense.”Two brothers and one power?  Or-Oh, I was an idiot.“That we are,” Tristan said.We.  “You’re a case seventy?”“I can’t tell you how bummed I am that it isn’t case sixty-nine instead, but no, that number went to a bigfoot sighting or something stupid.  A stupid bit of immature humor would’ve been the one good thing in this mess of a thing.”“Case seventies in North America included Knot, Tandem, Zigzag was one, I think, there was House of Three in Quebec.  And… you, it seems.”“One or two of them might not be seventies, but they get called seventies because they’re close enough.  Blurred lines, like you said.  When twins trigger, the powers are identical or nearly identical.  When twins trigger and they’re touching one another, like you said to Rain, things get blurry, the agent is too stupid or careless to tell where one starts and the other ends, or it wants to fuck with us, and it jams everything in together.  Two minds, two similar powers, and one body to be shared.”“Is he asleep?” I asked.“No.  He’s in here, he’s watching and listening.  He sleeps when I sleep, or I sleep when he sleeps, if he’s in the driver’s seat.  We trade out for two hour shifts.”“Can he communicate?” I asked.  “Talk to you while it’s your turn?”“That would be too easy,” Tristan said.  His good humor was gone now.  He just looked sad.  “No.”No.Two brothers, and only one of them could be interacting with the world at a time.  For the other, it was- picturing it made me think of being in the hospital again.  Being stuck, immobile, locked in while the world went on around them.Oppressive, that kind of thinking.  Just as oppressive to be living it.“I like Byron,” Kenzie said.  “I really wish he would stay for the therapy sessions.”“I like him too,” Rain said.  He leaned back in his chair, hands at his hair, pushing it away from his face as he stretched.  “I don’t like talking about you like you’re not here, Byron.  We’ll hang out later, okay?  Unwind.”“It’s been a long and rocky road,” Tristan said, to me.  “He’s not interested in the hero thing either.  He’s on Mrs. Yamada’s side here.  On yours, kind of, Victoria.”On my side?  I was trying to frame my argument, but it was an uphill battle for logic to win against the heart, and it did seem like their hearts were in this, to varying degrees.I decided to say as much.“I might not be winning any points with Mrs. Yamada in this,” I said.  “And I don’t know enough about your individual situations, but you have personal, thought out reasons for wanting to do this.  At this stage, I’m not telling you guys you shouldn’t do this.  I’m definitely, definitely not saying you should.  I think there are a few things to work out.  I’m honestly really concerned about Ashley.”“As anyone should be,” Ashley said.“That would be why I’m concerned.  I don’t know if you guys want to sit down as a group at a cafe or something, hammer out some basic plans.  You’d probably want something like an outline or playbook that you can take with you when you’re talking to the Wardens or whoever’s managing the territory closest to you.  I think the hero teams are covering different sections of the city, and you wouldn’t want to step on jurisdictional toes.  If you want to do this.”“That could be great,” Sveta said.Kenzie nodded, very enthusiastically, as in most things.“Chris and Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “You’ve been quiet.”“I’ve talked about wanting to pick Victoria’s brain and she listed some topics,” Kenzie said.  “I like this whole conversation as a recap, seeing where everyone’s at, instead of trying to think back to previous sessions and think about what people’s reasons are.  I’m glad we’re talking like this and I want to have that meeting and figure things out.”“Chris?”  Mrs. Yamada prodded.“Can I just say I don’t want to share with the guest here?”“You can,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “Is it the truth?”Chris looked annoyed as he looked at her.  “I don’t like talking about stuff.  Digging into my thoughts for answers stresses me out and throws me more out of whack than it helps.”“You can’t exist purely on the surface level,” Mrs. Yamada said.“I can.  It might or might not be good for me, but something that could be good or could be bad is a lot better than no-win after no-win.”“No win?” I asked.“I could say it’s none of your business,” Chris said.“You could,” I said.  “It’s your right.”“I don’t see why you’re as defensive as you are,” Sveta said.“I’m playing defense because paranoia is the only way to survive,” Chris said.  He reached up to adjust his headphones, wincing mid-adjustment.  “How many sessions did it take before I gave you all the basics?”“Four or five,” Kenzie said.“Well, this is session one with the new person,” Chris said.  “If you want to drop me from the team because I’m not okay with that, fine.  I’ll figure something else out.”“Nobody is saying that,” Sveta said.  “You’ve come this far with us, don’t get shy now.”“I’m not shy, I’m suspicious.  That won’t change,” Chris said.  He sounded irritated, in a way his expression didn’t convey effectively.“Okay,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “I don’t think pressuring Chris will help anything.  Again, however, I would really urge everyone present to periodically take stock.  Pay attention to what you’re feeling, imagine this dialogue extrapolated out to a greater, higher-stakes situation.  How will you handle your feelings, and will you feel have both a voice and the ability to affect the changes you need?”“You’re worried we’ll get railroaded,” Rain said.“I’m worried about a number of things, Rain.  I wish you would be willing to put things off for six months or a year, maintain contact, see how you get along as simple friends and acquaintances, let the ties solidify or break as they will, and then move forward if it is what you still want.”“There are a lot of issues to hammer out,” I said.  “You’re coming at this from so many different directions… how do you even get started in terms of the kind of team you end up being?  In other things?  I’d join my voice to Mrs. Yamada’s and urge you to take your time.”“Like I said, I’m feeling the pressure,” Rain said.  “My cluster is homing in on me.”“I can talk to people, if you want.  If you need another cape to back you up, I might be able to help.”“I mean, that sounds nice,” Rain said.  “But I can’t help but lie in bed some mornings, wondering if this is the day.  If, in the next twenty-four hours, the other three members of my cluster come after me in an organized way, with a lot of money and a lot of resources poured into things.  When I see it playing out in my head, I know they’re organized, and I worry we’re not.  If we’re part of a team, if we’re training, coordinating, then maybe we can work together in an organized way too.”“There’s a lot that goes into making a team.  You can stay together and watch Rain’s back, meet, talk, and plan.”“Without getting the practice in?” Tristan asked.  “Sorry to butt in again, but it takes time to learn how to work with teammates.  Some more than  others.”“What you’re wanting to do on the heroism front is hard enough without added complications.  It’s a bad, bad climate for heroes to try to get started.  That could end up being more distraction than the training is a boon.”“Imagine how bad the climate would be if nobody new got started,” Tristan said.“Yeah,” I said.  “I won’t deny that.  I just- I have serious reservations, but I also recognize I probably won’t be changing any minds.  Instead of trying to get you to reverse course or stop, I’m saying maybe change trajectories a bit.  Go slow, focus on what needs to be focused on, instead of getting distracted with the many, many side things that go into getting a proper team started.”“Focusing on keeping Rain safe, as the priority thing?” Sveta asked.“Yeah,” I said.  “I can meet you guys at a coffee shop or somewhere, we can make it a regular thing.  I can back you up, I might be able to introduce you to people, and we do what Mrs. Yamada suggested, and take months or a year to get a really good game plan put together.”“You’re committing to a lot, Victoria,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “It won’t conflict with your other plans?”“I like doing this sort of thing.  I’ll find a way to work it in.  It gives me an opportunity to stay in touch with Sveta, too.”I was elbowed, hard, from my left.“If you think I’m letting you drift away or lose touch now then you need a reality check,” Sveta said.“Wasn’t planning on it, don’t worry,” I said.“I don’t like it,” Kenzie said.It was an abrupt statement, cutting into the dialogue, the serious tone different from the easy back-and-forth.“We wouldn’t be leaving you out,” Sveta said.  “You said you were interested in what Victoria knew about heroes, and you’d be part of the team when we got started.”“No I wouldn’t,” Kenzie said.  “Because you all would be doing what you have to do to help Rain, and I’d be on the sidelines.  You said you don’t want to have a kid there in a dangerous situation, so I wouldn’t actually be there when things went down.  And if you thought there would be an attack soon you wouldn’t want me hanging around in case I got caught up in it, so you’d all meet and I’d stay home then, too.”“It could be over in a couple of weeks,” Rain said.“It could not be over, too,” Kenzie said.  She smiled.  “Come on.  I’ve done this before.  Again and again.  I did it during the leadership camps and the exercises in San Diego.  I did it during the branding in LA and I kind of did it with the Baltimore Wards.”“Did what?” I asked.“Got left behind.  Or sidelined and ignored.  The reasons were good, or maybe I’m a stupid, gullible idiot and the reasons are bad, and I believed them anyway.”“I liked your contributions to the group, I’d want you to stick around,” I said.“I know you mean well, Victoria, but this is the way it always goes,” Kenzie said.  She shrugged.  “The compliments, the softening of the blow.  I think you’re nice and you’re trying to do the right thing.  But again and again, because I’m a kid, or because I’m small and weak, or because I’m a girl, or because I’m black, or because I have school, or because I’m vulnerable, or I’m annoying, or because they want to be careful around me because I have problems, or because I’ve said the wrong things because I’m an idiot a lot of the time, or because- because whatever the reason, good or bad, hateful or kind…”She trailed off there.  She was staring down at the ground, head down where I couldn’t see it.  She huffed out out a small laugh.Her hands were on either side of her hips, gripping the sides of the plastic chair.“Articulate what you want, Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “Assertive.  Not passive, not passive-aggressive.”“I don’t want to be left behind,” Kenzie said.  She was speaking more slowly, deliberately.  A dramatic change of pace from her usual output.  “I’m experienced in this, so when I say I think I see things going this way, it would be nice if people believed me.”“More assertive, Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada said.“Trust me,” Kenzie said, with emphasis.  She looked up, flashed a smile at me, then shrugged.  “You say you’re experienced in cape stuff and I think it shows and that’s amazing.  I’m experienced in this and I’m really tired of this song and dance.”“I understand,” I said.  “I’m sorry to have touched on something that sensitive.  I should have been more considerate.”“It’s not you,” she said.  “It’s me.  It’s a regular thing.  I don’t blame you.  It’s the way I am, it makes people act this way around me.  And-”She drew in a deep breath.“-And I would like to be included from the beginning, in a way where I’m useful and participating and I’m not watching from the sidelines.  I would like to do the team thing from the beginning.  I don’t mind if it’s small or slow but I want to do something with progress.  Or if not that, then tell me upfront so I can have my feelings hurt now right away instead of over a long time.”“This is really important to you,” I said.“There have only ever been three times in my life where people acted like they wanted me around.  Not counting the adults who get paid to look after me, sorry Mrs. Yamada.  The first one, it led to my trigger, so you can imagine how well that went.  The second one was the couple of months I spent with the Baltimore Wards, and they don’t want anything to do with me anymore.  The third is here.  These guys.”“Well gee whiz, Kenzie,” Tristan said.She smiled, “Sorry.”“I like to win my arguments, but you can’t bring that kind of weaponry to bear.  It’s just not fair on those guys.”Kenzie smiled again.“I’m glad you like us,” Sveta said.  “I do want to include you, and I hope this thing works out the way you want it to.”“We’ll figure something out,” I said.“We?” Ashley asked.“I was going to say,” Chris said.“I’m not trying to step on your toes or insinuate myself into things,” I said.  “But if you’ll have me, maybe I could take on a role as coach or something.  If you really want to do this-”I could see the looks on their faces.  Yeah, they wanted to do this.“-Then maybe we avoid having you guys go from a mediated discussion in a controlled environment like this to… something more loosely supervised and managed, for the mediation part of things, and we look for a shallower pool to dive into instead, where you can get started in some capacity sooner, we ensure everyone has something to do, but we keep it manageable and small.”“You’re volunteering?” Tristan asked.“If Mrs. Yamada is okay with this idea.  I don’t see you guys changing your minds, so…”“It would bring me some peace of mind,” Mrs. Yamada said.“Mediated,” Rain said.  “You’d be babysitting us?”“Coaching, giving direction if it’s lacking, give you someone to turn to if you need someone to help resolve a dispute.  I can’t promise you full time hours, it’d be a secondary or minor thing for me, but… I’m trying to think of a good way to tackle this and this is the best idea I’ve got.”“Yes,” Kenzie said.  “I want to hear more about the heroing stuff.”“I wouldn’t object,” Ashley said.“And the shallow end?” Tristan asked.“We’ll figure something out,” I said.  “I’m thinking of a couple of possible places, we could put feelers out in one that’s close enough for everyone here to get to.  A few of these places have small populations of B-listers, and I think it would be a good, easy place to learn the ropes.”                                                                                           Flare – 2.7                                                                                           “I felt energized after,” I said.“Can you elaborate on that?” Mrs. Yamada asked.“My cousin remarked I looked better, more in touch with the world.  Normally, I get these intrusive… non-thoughts.”“Non-thoughts?” Rain asked.“Like, not intrusive thoughts, not ideas that I can’t get out of my head, but my mind has these places it tries to go, and I reflexively shut them out.  Like, one thing, I spent two years in the hospital and in the care home, obsessing,” I said.“I know what you’re talking about,” Sveta said.“Yeah. And I feel like I’ve devoted enough thought to that.  Two years of time, more than a lifetime’s worth.  So I lock up, mentally, or trip over the subject.  I get that a lot as my mood gets worse.  I have it for things I do, like using my powers.  I had it a lot less after the day at the hospital.”“Some people have physiological signs, feeling ill, headaches, breathing, when they’re trying to find an outlet for things they can’t otherwise express,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “Others have habits, things or people they go back to, they could have needs or cravings.”“What if the thing you turn to is also the thing that causes stress?” Kenzie asked.“That is absolutely a thing that happens, Kenzie.  It’s at the root of downward spirals like addiction or overeating.  On a more subtle level, something like a panic disorder can self-reinforce because the panic provides relief, even as it makes the actual situations worse.  I like that Victoria identified something that arrests or controls the downward spiral.”“It’s the sort of thing I plan to do again,” I said.  “Putting all the other stuff aside, distilling things down to the most basic route of helping people, in a way that’s good and healthy for me, too.  Or-”Mrs. Yamada had started speaking at the same time I added the ‘or’.  We both stopped.“Go ahead,” she said.“Or where there’s bad, the good is enough to outweigh that bad and leave me better off,” I said.  I shrugged.“Here in the group, we often discuss the issues we’re facing, how we relate to what others bring up, and we talk about solutions.  I’ll periodically try to turn things to more positive topics, but with six people here, it’s common for people to come to the session with something they want to delve into.“I like that you’re dwelling on the good things, Victoria, and that you’re giving me an excuse to turn things toward a better note as we wrap up.  Does anyone else have something to share?”Tristan raised one hand a little, and Mrs. Yamada nodded, giving him permission to say.“It’s not positive,” he said.  “I don’t know if that’s alright.”“It’s fine.  Go ahead.”“What Victoria was saying, how she was saying she was happy, seeing the kids happy, and how she felt energized after.  I don’t have that.  I don’t have a way to recharge when I’m not at one hundred percent.”“You definitely have things you’re passionate about,” Rain said.“I like people, parties, noise, really letting the walls drop away and having fun.  There are things I’d want to go out and do which I can’t.  Things I’m not comfortable talking about with Kenzie present.”Kenzie smiled at him.  “Rude stuff.  I’m not that young.”“I know you probably know, I’m still not comfortable talking about it like this,” Tristan said.“You say Kenzie but you don’t even mention me,” Chris said.  “I’m perversely pleased by that.  You mean fucking, right?”“Please, Chris,” Mrs. Yamada said.“I mean stuff,” Tristan said, “Stuff I can’t do because of my situation.  I did some of it back before the trigger.  More like sophomore high schoolers stealing their parents booze and having way too many people in a house while the parents are away, but that was the time of my life.  It was when I was the most excited to be on this- on that planet.  Now I can’t do stuff like that, the pressure release valve is screwed up for the same reasons I’m screwed up.”“The case seventy stuff,” I said.“Yeah,” he said.  “Now me passing out drunk might mean I screw up the time window for passing back control, however many alarms I set, and I can’t do that to Byron.  I can’t go have a one night stand because the way things are mean I’d be involving him in it as a bystander or voyeur.”“Can you find new outlets?” Sveta asked.  “One thing I’ve learned over the past little while is that I still had a lot of growing to do.  It’s easy when you’re in a bad place to think ‘this is it, this is me,’ but there’s always more out there.”“I’m trying,” Tristan said.  “But it sucks to know that the stuff I want to do and the people I want to do are out there and I can’t do that.  I know it’s the same for Byron.  It’s different for him, though, because he’s a quiet guy, he wants to take it easy, but you get the weird conflict where you want to chill out but you can’t because you also want to maximize your use of time, when you only get to live half your life.”“I’d like to talk about that at a later point, when we’re not a minute away from wrapping up,” Mrs. Yamada said.  “I’d also like to have a word with Byron and you after the session, make sure everything’s okay.”“Sure,” Tristan said.“On a positive note, if nobody minds,” Sveta said, sitting up with the faintest of metal-on-metal sounds.  “I got to recharge too, but it was a big one.”“Your trip?” Kenzie asked.“I know we talked about it last week, but we mostly talked about Rain staying safe and the hero team thing.  It wasn’t a little pick me up.  It was big, and I really want to find the chances to go and do stuff like that again.”“Traveling?” I asked.  Her smile was contagious.“Traveling.  We had a boat, and when we weren’t around people, I got out of my hamster ball.  We stayed pretty close to the coasts, Weld sailing or driving the boat and me swimming.  It was really, really nice.”“I can tell you got a lot of sun,” Tristan said.Sveta smiled.  Her face was so pale that her complexion was borderline impossible for a human.  “I like swimming.  I want to find a way to get out and do it more.  It’s the first time I can remember moving and having there be resistance.  Everything else is too hard or too reflex.”“Anyone else?” Mrs. Yamada asked.  “Final words?  Thoughts?”“I’m glad you had a good time,” Kenzie said.“I really did,” Sveta said.There was a pause.  No responses, the only sound was a clack as the wind blew the blinds away from the window and they swung back into position.  I wondered how bad the rain was.Mrs. Yamada looked up at the clock, then said, “Then we should wrap up.  Tristan, a word.  Everyone else, have a good week.  There won’t be a Friday meeting this week, so I will see you next Tuesday.”“I’d like to exchange people’s contact information, if it’s okay,” I said.  “If you’re wanting to do this.”“You keep saying that like you’re hoping we won’t,” Ashley said.“It might make things simpler,” I said.“The others have my number,” she said.  “I don’t keep track of it.”“Sure,” I said.“Do you guys mind giving Victoria my number while you’re at it?” Tristan asked.“Can do,” Rain said.People were standing, now.  Tristan gave Sveta a hand in getting to her feet.The group, Tristan excepted, filed out into the hallway.  A few people had coats draped or hooked on the the stacked plastic chairs along the hallway’s length.  I’d left my bag on the ground.  I pulled my phone out before I slung it over one shoulder.A message from Crystal, asking if I was coming home for dinner.“Pass me your number?” Rain asked.  His phone was as battered as he was, with a crack running down the case.I thumbed through the concentric rings, put my thumb on my phone number and profile information, and then flicked it in Rain’s direction.“Got it,” he said.His info appeared on my phone, at the top edge.  It was soon joined by Tristan’s, then Kenzie’s and Ashley’s, near simultaneously.  Kenzie’s name was framed with colorful symbols.  Chris’s and Sveta’s were the last to appear.Rain had handled sending me Sveta’s, Ashley’s and Tristan’s, it seemed.  Ashley was pulling on a raincoat, and Sveta’s hands were clasped in front of her.Sveta might have sent me hers without using her hands, now that I thought about it.  It was possible she had a phone in her suit.I glanced back into the room, to see if Mrs. Yamada had anything she wanted to convey with a look or gesture.  Instead, I saw her talking to someone who wasn’t Tristan.Byron had black hair, shorter than Tristan’s, slicked back with something that shone in the room’s lights.  He wore a jacket, a black v-neck shirt, and jeans.  The contrast between him and Tristan in everything but facial features were striking- Tristan had been bright haired, his top and shorts all about contrasts with light and dark, color and lack thereof.  He’d brimmed with confidence.Byron didn’t.  He looked distinctly uncomfortable, his hands in his jacket pockets, shoulders forward, a look of concern on his face.  The muted gray-blue of his jacket, the black v-neck shirt, the jeans, there weren’t any of the intentional contrasts I’d seen in Tristan.“Are we going to wait for Tristan and try to have a quick chat about things?” Rain asked.“I have dinner,” Kenzie said.  She looked at me.  “I try to have dinner with my parents every night.  We’re trying to reinforce that normalcy.”“Is that going alright?” Sveta asked.“It’s going,” Kenzie said.  She smiled.  “Which is better than the alternative.”“I’m all people’d out,” Chris said.  “Most of you guys are better than some, but I’m done for now.”“That’s a good enough reason to put it off, then,” Rain said.  He gripped the doorframe, leaning into the room a little.  I heard Mrs. Yamada’s voice stop.“Yes?” she asked.“Wanted to let Tristan and Byron know we’re heading out.  We’re not meeting today.”“Okay,” Byron said.  “He’ll have heard you.”He sounded different, even.  Quieter, in the way people talked if they were sure they’d be heard regardless, if they didn’t care, or, on the other side of things if they knew they wouldn’t be listened to.“We’ll hang out,” Rain said.  “You and me, we’ll do something soon.”“Okay.  How’s Erin?”“She’s good,” Rain said.  “I could invite her to come with.”“I wouldn’t mind.”“Yeah, for sure,” Rain said.Rain was still smiling when he stepped away from the door.“Let’s go,” Rain said.I had to pause as Kenzie and Chris got out of my way and turned to head down the hallway, while Rain and Ashley led the way.  I didn’t catch Ashley and Rain’s brief exchange of words.I glanced back at the room, and saw Byron was looking at me while he was saying something to Mrs. Yamada.  The up-down look, followed by the quick glance away when he realized I’d seen him.You’re too young for me and you’re not my type, based on what little I’ve seen and heard, I thought.Sveta took my arm, squeezing it.  My reminder to focus on the others.“You’re okay,” Sveta said, squeezing harder for a moment.  “You can talk.”“You seem to be doing okay yourself,” I said.“I’m great,” she said.  “Today was a good day.”We walked to catch up, and I could feel Sveta periodically leaning harder on me as she worked to maintain her stride.  For all that she was in there, no doubt pulling on multiple components and relying on intricate machinery, she managed pretty darn well.A little less so on the stairs to the ground floor, but I gave her my arm and plenty of support, and she did okay.She hugged me with enthusiasm as we walked the five feet from the stairs to the side door, where the others were waiting under the rectangle of roof that jutted out from the side of the boxy building.“I’m going,” Chris said.  “Bye.”“Bye,” Sveta said, amid a few other scattered responses.  I raised one hand in a token wave.Chris removed his headphones as he walked away, stowing them in one pocket of his cargo shorts.  He didn’t use an umbrella or wear a raincoat.  He seemed content to get rained on.Kenzie had a blue raincoat with duffle coat toggles on the front, and was standing a bit in the rain, head bent over her phone.  Ashley stood on the sidewalk, her hood up.  Rain had settled for an umbrella, but hadn’t opened it yet.“I’m walking to the bus station in Webster,” Rain said.  “Normally Tristan, Sveta, and I walk that way.”“I can head that way,” I said.  “I’ll walk with you guys for a bit.”“I’ll come,” Kenzie said, not looking up from her phone.  “There’s still time before dinner.”“You sure?” Sveta asked.“Yep,” Kenzie looked up from her phone.“And Ashley?” I asked.She didn’t reply, turning away to look down the length of the road.  She turned around, looking the other way.  In that moment, a car appeared.“I’ve got a ride,” she said.“Spending time with the the ol’ guardians?” Sveta asked.I didn’t miss the word choice.  The forced cavalier attitude.  Awkward.“I try to get as many of my appointments into the same day as I can,” Ashley said.  “It’s nuisance enough to have my day disrupted with this inanity, I don’t want it taking over my weeks.”“We’re inanity, are we?” Rain asked.“You can be,” Ashley said.  “Checkups and tests, therapy, group therapy, being supervised without it being official supervision, interviews, prosthetics tune-ups, work.  It becomes inane.”“It’s all for good reasons,” Sveta said.“I’d do better without all of the distractions,” Ashley said.  She looked at me, and she did the up-down assessment too.  It was something different from what Byron had done.  “I look forward to learning what you have to teach.”“It was nice to meet you,” I said.  I wasn’t sure if I was lying, but it seemed like the thing to say.She walked down the little dirt path that extended through the grass from the building’s side door to the road.  A black sedan.  She opened the back door, climbed in, and closed the door with more force than was probably necessary.“I have so many questions,” I said.“Weld’s kind-of dad figure was the Director in charge of the Boston PRT,” Sveta said.  “He was also kind of in charge of looking after Ashley, because her town was close to Boston.”“Making sure she didn’t do too much damage?” I asked.“Yes.  And gradually trying to get her used to the idea of cooperating with the good guys, making sure she was staying reasonably healthy.  They reached out regularly, letting her know there were better options.  Except that Ashley was a different Ashley.”“Yeah,” I said.  “She’s going to be on your team?”“Yeah,” Sveta said.I didn’t have a response for that.She squeezed my arm.  “I spent a lot of time with a lot of people who never got a chance, Victoria.  I feel like it’s my duty to give her one.”I drew in a deep breath, then sighed.  “I don’t disagree.”“But you don’t wholly agree, either?” Rain asked.“I… believe in second chances.  Not necessarily in every circumstance, though, which seems to be the direction a lot of people are going.”“We should walk,” Rain said.  “The sooner we get where we split off in different directions, the earlier Kenzie can head back to her parents’ and make it on time for dinner.”“Yes, please,” Kenzie said, still looking down at her phone.Sveta had an umbrella.  I held it so Sveta could walk while leaning on me, the two of us sharing it.There weren’t many cars on the road, and even with the overcast sky making it rather dark out for the late afternoon, there weren’t many lights on either.  The route we were walking put us on a long stretch of road with small businesses and restaurants on either side.  Most of the illumination came from store signs in bright colors that were reflected in the puddles.“I didn’t get a great read on Chris,” I said.  “He’s the other big set of question marks.”“I like Chris,” Kenzie said, without looking up.  “He’s crazy smart about some things and adorkably stupid about others.  He’s hard to figure out but when he lets you in it makes you feel special.”She said something like that with no compunctions, no reservations.  I almost envied her.Sveta reached out and placed a hand on top of Kenzie’s hood.  “It would be unfair to share Chris’ story when he didn’t want to share it himself, Victoria.  I only said what I said about Ashley because she’s open about it.”“In fairness, I wasn’t asking or prying,” I said.  “I was remarking.”“Remarking with a question mark at the end?” Rain asked.“Inviting an answer, but not pressing for one,” I said.  “I can drop it.”“Okay,” Kenzie said.  She put her phone away.  “All caught up.  Stir fry for dinner, I’m going to pick up broccoli, and my workshop is warming up for later.”“You’ve got a workshop, like a proper tinker,” I said.“Absolutely,” Kenzie said, dead serious.“Are you hiding a jetpack inside that raincoat, or are those rocket boots?” I asked.“I wish,” Kenzie said.  “I can’t do that stuff.  I make cameras and inconveniently big boxes.  My best stuff is inconveniently big, box-shaped cameras.”“Big boxes?” I asked.“The term in my file is emplacements.  Terminals, tech, and computers big enough they’re hard to move around.  Like turrets, but I can’t really make good weapons or defensive things.”“I see.  I can see why Watchdog wanted you.”“Grr, arf.”And I might be able to see why your supervisors wanted to keep you away from the front lines.“Out of curiosity,” I said.  “Where are people?  I’m trying to figure out where you guys are situated and what locations might work.”“I’m from Norwalk Station,” Kenzie said.Norwalk Station would be off to the west end of Norfair, where we had the community center incident.  The ‘Nor’ part of Norfair.  It was a nice-ish area.  I’d passed through it a few times.  “And you’re in school?  Are you in the morning or afternoon block?”“Morning.  I joined the study block for afternoons, I keep good grades so they let me, and I have paperwork from before that says they’re not supposed to give me too much homework, so I don’t have too much to do in the afternoons.”“They might expect you to check in,” I said.“They might.”“Weld and I are in Stratford, so is Ashley,” Sveta said.  “Chris lives somewhere around here.  Tristan is close to here.”Here being Fairfield.“Bridgeport span, here,” I said.  “I’m closer to you guys in Stratford than not.”“Of course I’m the furthest out,” Kenzie said.“Almost,” Rain said.“Almost,” Kenzie echoed him.“Where are you situated?” I asked Rain.“It’s complicated,” he said.“Uh huh.  That’s starting to sound like a catchphrase.”“I hate saying it as much as people hate hearing it.  Locationwise, I’ve always liked saying I’m from everywhere that isn’t anywhere.”I gave him a look.“Stop being vague and teasing Victoria,” Sveta said.“I’m not teasing.  I’m in the middle of nowhere, it’s hard to pin down.  North of Greenwich.  It’s a trip to get here.”That put Tristan, Byron and Chris close to center, Kenzie out west, Rain out to the far northwest, me a bit to the east, and Sveta and Ashley a bit further to the east.  With the trains I was figuring it might take about four or five hours for Kenzie to get to where Sveta and Ashley were situated.  It would take Rain another couple of hours, depending on how far north he was.“That’s a pretty significant logistics problem,” I said.  “Even in the best case scenario, if we found a place close to here, that’s a two hour or more trip for people to get here?”“I could build something,” Kenzie said.  “I can’t make promises.”“How confident are you?” I asked.“Kind of confident,” she said, sounding anything but.  “I haven’t done teleportation or breaking movement devices before, but if I made it a series of emplacements and built them big, then if I traveled once a week or so to visit the send-receives and make sure they don’t break down, it might work.”“Tinker stuff breaks,” I said.“It does,” Kenzie said.“It would also be liable to break or break down when you needed it to work the most.  During disasters, or times when there aren’t a lot of downtime.”“That’s very true,” Kenzie said.“I’m wondering if there’s even a good way to go about this.  I’m not trying to screw you guys up, I’m genuinely wondering.”“It might not be as complicated as it seems,” Sveta said.  “I can move quickly if I have to, Ashley doesn’t have much occupying her days, when she doesn’t have her appointments, and I don’t think she minds much.  She’s happy to wake up early and read on the train, she even goes to the New York hub a lot, and that’s a full day trip.  As for you, you can fly again-”She squeezed my arm as she said it, rocking a bit side to side as she did it.  I rocked a bit with her.“-and the way you were talking about things, this wouldn’t be a full-time thing for you,” Sveta finished.  Her enthusiasm had risen as she talked, and only dropped with that last part.“Maybe,” I said.  “It seems you’d want a location that was closer to Kenzie and Chris then.  Closer to Rain.”“Yeah,” Rain said.  He was looking around a fair bit.  “I don’t mind the trips, either.”“You okay?” I asked him.“Yeah.  Forgot for a short while that I have an attempt out on my life.  I really should dwell on it more, to be safe, especially with Kenzie in tow.”“I can hold my own,” Kenzie said.“It’s an attempt on my life,” Rain said.  “Lives could be lost.  I don’t want yours to be one of them.  I would feel insanely shitty if you jumped in to help and you got hurt or killed.”“Insanely?”“Yes.”“Okay.”“I’m going to call my ride, I think.  See if she can catch me en route instead of me going to her,” Rain said.“She?  Erin the lady friend?” Kenzie asked.“Erin the friendship I’m not going to mess with,” Rain said.   He pulled out the phone and stepped a bit away, walking at the road’s edge instead of on the sidewalk.We reached an intersection, and Rain stepped away, one hand to his ear while he held the phone to the other.  His eyes roved, looking at nearby rooftops and the dark spaces between buildings.The building at the corner of the intersection was a bar, and a group of ten or so people were standing outside, smoking.  The place and the people smelled like the cheap alcohol that was barely a step above moonshine, that was being sold on the cheap in a lot of places.  Made to fill a need, now a surplus, with cheap, shitty beer available to fill the need instead.Their attention was on Sveta.“Hey,” one called out.She glanced at them, then set to ignoring them.  I took her cue.“Hey,” the guy called out again, drawing out the word.  “Hey, you with the paint.”“Whatever you’re going to say, I’ve heard it before,” Sveta said.“What the fuck’s going on with you, huh?  What’s wrong with you?” he called out.I turned my head to look at him.  Sveta squeezed my arm, then shook her head a little.“Hey, you’re weird,” he called out.  “You’re freaky.”The light changed.  We crossed, Rain trailing a bit behind, still on the phone, periodically responding.  He shot the guys a dark look.“I don’t like it when people are mean to you,” Kenzie said.“Thank you for that,” Sveta said.  “And thank you, Victoria.  I know you probably wanted to say something.  I’m glad we didn’t make it into a thing.”“Does it happen a lot?” I asked.“Some.  It beats people running away and screaming, and the running and screaming part beat people dying because of me,” Sveta said.  “This is an improvement.  Things will improve more in the future.  I believe that.”“Yeah,” I said.  “Me too.”“Me too,” Kenzie said.Sveta put a hand on Kenzie’s hooded head, squeezed my arm.“My ride’s here,” Rain said, catching up with us, waving at a distant vehicle with its headlights on.  I got a better view of it as it pulled up beside us.  It wasn’t a pretty vehicle – a van with rust around the right headlight.  “We’ve got a good long drive back.  Was good seeing you guys, good to meet you, Victoria.”“Good to meet you, Rain,” I said.The driver stuck her hand out, waving.  We moved around to where we could see her through the passenger-side window.Erin, Rain’s friendship he wasn’t intending to mess with, was not the kind of person I imagined driving a van like that, or spending time with someone of Rain’s somewhat grungy, not-inclined-to-smile presentation.  There were women where someone’s first thought might be ‘they could be a model’ and there were women where the first thought was ‘they have to be a model, it’s not fair if they aren’t’.  She was the latter.  Short black hair with a long swoop at the front, dangly jewelry, more piercings in one ear, and one of the memorial shirts, much like how the dress I was wearing served as a way for me to represent and remember Brockton Bay.  She was from New York, it seemed, or she wanted to represent it.“Erin, you’ve seen Kenzie and Sveta before.”“Hi again,” Erin said.“And this is Victoria.  We were talking about having her be our coach.”“Hi,” Erin said, leaning toward Rain to get a better view of me, extending her hand in another wave.  Rain looked momentarily like a deer in the headlights with Erin’s face close, with Erin doing a very good job at not noticing or not looking like she’d noticed.  “You look a lot like Glory Girl.”“I am,” I said.  “I was.”“Huh,” Erin said.  “That’s really cool.  Maybe I’ll see you around?”“It’s likely,” I said.“You guys have a good night.”“You too,” Kenzie said.  She held up her phone, like she was trying to get a signal.  “Drive safe.”“We good to go?” Erin asked.“Yep,” Rain said.  “You want a ride somewhere convenient, Kenz?”“Sure!”Kenzie climbed in behind Rain, giving us a wave before the door was closed.Just Sveta and me left.We watched as the van pulled away.“I have a lot of sympathy for Rain,” Sveta said.“Are you talking about the attempt on his life or the long car trip with the girl he very clearly likes?”“Oh, yeah, the dangerous thing too,” Sveta said.  “Mostly the long trip.”“Yeah,” I said.“But that’s all negative.  We’re going in the same direction, right?  We can catch up?”“We can definitely catch up.  I want to hear more about that vacation.”“And you can come over for dinner, right?  Sometime?  You’re not far.  I can’t promise a good dinner, because I’m still trying to find food that Weld can really taste that won’t make the neighbors evacuate their apartments, but there’s takeout!  Or delivery.  I’m sure there’s something we can do.”“You couldn’t keep me away,” I said.⊙Sleep eluded me.  I stood on the balcony, I stared out at a city without nearly enough lights or light in it, a jagged and incomplete skyline, and I tried to shake a persistent melancholy I couldn’t put my finger on.The day had been a good one.  My friendship with Sveta rekindled, with Sveta doing as well as I could hope for, possibilities for the future, interesting puzzles to work out, and I’d been able to do favors for people I cared about.A part of it was the therapy.  It was strange, to be in a place mentally and emotionally where therapy had a cost to it, in a way.  The voice of Mrs. Yamada and the tone of the conversations reminded me of the darkest period in my life.  Those reminders were probably responsible for the nightmares that had torn me from sleep.Maybe it would be good if I called the new therapist, a new voice.It wasn’t the nightmares that kept me from getting back to sleep, but a restless nagging feeling.  I liked problems I could decisively solve, things I could tell myself I had an answer for, something I could handle in the dawn, and then I could go back to sleep.  The feeling that had settled with me wasn’t that sort of answerable question.It was the restless nagging that had me carefully and slowly open the sliding door of the balcony, step into the living room, and gather some things.  A bag with my wallet and things, fresher clothes, the mask I’d worn for the broken trigger incident.I went flying, and my destination wasn’t one that would answer the nagging feeling, but one that could answer other, more concrete questions.  With luck, I’d be able to distract myself.There were cities and areas I’d considered for the therapy group’s expedition.  Ones in need, ones I knew didn’t fall neatly in one jurisdiction or another.  I used the highways and major roadways as my waypoints, so I wouldn’t pass them or find myself flying too far north or south.The sun was rising by the time I reached the first.  Sherwood span.  Too low a population, I could tell right away.  Too many farms, the houses too spread out.It took me twenty minutes to reach the next.  The area was slow to wake up, which was a surprise, given the amount of construction sites I could see from above.  Usually the work started first thing.It was a nice slice of city, with a view of the water, tall buildings, shiny, modern, with nice, large houses, but it was only halfway erected.    There were cars in driveways, but there wasn’t much life.I flew low, stopping at one of the gates to a construction site for a taller building.Laminated sheets had been put up on the gates.Construction suspended until we’re given what we’re owed.The same was on display in other places, with laminated sheets of paper and graffiti.  Some of it was angrier.I was reading a very bold, large bit of text about how certain people should be choking on cocks, when I saw I had company, standing in the corner of my field of view.  A cape.I turned to face them.Not anyone I recognized.  A man in armor with spikes on it.  Plate mail, and plate armor was hard to get done right, especially in this modern day.  He carried no weapon I could see.  Spiky plate armor wasn’t exactly original or new, either.He didn’t say anything or do anything, but he was holding a piece of paper.I approached him, my forcefield up.  He didn’t budge.When I was in arm’s reach, he put his gauntlet toward me, paper in hand.  I dropped my forcefield to take it.“What’s this?”He wasn’t someone who sounded more intimidating from the inside of a helmet.  His voice was very normal as he said, “We saw you fly in, we discussed, we called some people, this is our message to you.”“Got it,” I said.  I looked around.  “Quiet town.”When my head was turned, he reached for my throat.I put my forcefield up, and I knocked his hand aside, forcefully enough I almost put him on his ass.  The sound rang in my ears.“Our town,” he said.That said, he trudged off.I watched him go, and then I walked in the opposite direction.  People were watching from doorsteps with coffee in hand, or standing by cars, now.I didn’t want to back down or look weak, not if this was possibly a place I might be visiting with any regularity, so I walked slowly, like I wasn’t bothered.With all that in mind, I still stopped in my tracks when I read the note.Turn around and fly home, Glory Hole



-TTThey’d asked around, huh?I folded the paper up, and I held the folded square as I walked, thinking, observing.  A slice of city, paralyzed, a clear villain presence.The guy with the spikes might have been Cleat.  A low-tier cape with some background in fighting rings and mercenary work.  Unlike most in fighting rings, he’d never found enough success to get traction in other circles.  Ironically.I’d left Brockton Bay in the middle of a situation, or I’d been taken from the city during.  I’d put in the hours and put heart and soul into trying to combat the badness that was taking over the city, and at the end of the day, I hadn’t ever enjoyed a resolution to that situation.  I’d never felt like I’d made enough of a difference in the end result.It was tempting, the idea of coming here to a place like this and somehow completing that journey or using a success here to convince myself I could have made a proper difference if I’d been given a chance.But this wasn’t about me.  It was about those teenagers and kids in Yamada’s group.A sign was erected by one construction site.  It was covered in graffiti.  ‘Cedar Point Apartments’ was written at the top, but ‘Cedar’ had been covered over in paint, and ‘Hollow’ had been written in its place.Cute, and from some cursory investigation, the rebranding had been performed elsewhere, throughout the district.  Graffiti and other signs of anger were clear as day, much of it vile and senseless.Did I really want to pit those kids against this?  They might give it a shot, and if it was insurmountable, Mrs. Yamada might be happy, and if it was surmountable, everyone would be happy.I wasn’t sure.I looked at the graffiti, getting a sense of the atmosphere here.  Vulgarity, vulgarity, obscenity, drawing of vulgarity, hate, anger, vulgarity, possible gang tag, ‘hollow point’ appearing again.I stopped in front of another piece of graffiti.  It wasn’t crowded in with anything else, so it stood out, almost a piece of art in how it was spelled out on a ruined wall, half-toppled.THIS IS HOW THINGS ARE NOWI had the paper in my hand, I had my doubts, but the nagging feeling ceased being nagging and became acutely clear as I looked at the statement.“Fuck that,” I said.                                                                                           Flare – Interlude 2                                                                                           “Long coat, long hair, just got through the door, has a gun,” Crystalclear said, thumb on the button of his walkie-talkie.The reply from the officers was almost impossible to make out.The status quo in quiet periods was for there to be two thinkers on duty at all times.  They were meant to be in communication and watching each other’s backs, and they were meant to be cooperating with the officers stationed at the portal.During the quieter times, it would have been less than perfect for his partner to be in the midst of the crowd, where it took effort for Crystalclear to keep track of him and watch the man’s back.Relay, one of his new teammates.It wasn’t a quiet period, as one of the day’s bigger trains had just arrived.  There were supposed to be four people on duty, one shift nearly over, another just beginning, for twice the number of eyes and powers on the scene.Yes, it could have been an accident that the other two had yet to arrive.  But accidents and coincidences could just as easily be contrivances at the hands of masterminds.  The radios acting up didn’t help matters.“-ot the gun, good ca-” the voice on the other side of the walkie talkie reported, the static cutting off the very beginning and the ending.Sure enough, the officers had the woman in the coat.  One of the officers had the gun, now.Red jacket, jeans, pointed boots, group of three, Relay communicated.  Words and ideas conveyed without being spoken.  Not telepathy, not sound, but impressions.Crystalclear’s vision didn’t give him color that wasn’t the blurring around the white outlines that defined everything.  Red jacket meant nothing to him.  But he could see the crowd, seeing everyone at once, and he could check the shoes.  It took some focus to narrow things down, to look for the pointed shoes, to observe for another few moments to see who was grouped up.Three people, all about the same age, all men.  Their heads radiated with distortions.  Their focus- not on anything in particular.  He saw what they were dwelling on as a series of fractures, distorted angles, and breaks that surrounded them.  These things suggested things about what was going on in their heads that were more limited to the moment, covering stresses in every sense of the word.Stress as in emotional upset, stressing the importance of something, stress as in tension and wear.He was glad he could use the landline for this.  The little room was separated from the portal and train platforms by two walls, one with a one-way pane of glass set in it.  The third wall was open, so he was free to step outside and be in the thick of things within seconds, without having to worry about doors or counters.  Beside him was a phone and a computer he hadn’t bothered to fiddle with – he couldn’t see the contents of the screen without pulling a crystal from his face.He hit the button for channel one on the phone, then picked up.“Relay reports there’s three people incoming.  He got a low-level bad feeling about them.  They seem stressed to me.  Not an imminent danger.  You might want to pull them out of line and have a chat.  One in the lead has a red jacket, pointed shoes.  I’ll give you more information on their positions once they’re settled in line.”“Got it.  Thank you, Crystalclear.”“Let us know if you need anyone to sit in,” he said.“Will do.”He was aware as heads throughout the crowd turned, their focus shifting to Relay, to the train, to the officers.  For most, the light around them refracted into kaleidoscopic structures, cone or beak shaped, pointed this way and that.  At the ends farthest from the points of focus, the open ends of the cones splayed out into nimbuses, auras, fractures.He had been one of them, a year ago, a refugee stepping off the train to enter Earth Gimel, finding his luggage, walking up the short set of stairs to the desks, where people clustered in families and groups of friends, rather than in single file.  They would be interviewed, they would be given temporary identification, and they would get their packages with information and resources.Unlike many  of them, he had waited nearly six months for access, because he’d been open about the fact he had powers.  A mistake, because they had wanted to be careful, it had meant he had needed weeks and months of screens, of interviews and background checks, while other people passed through.It wasn’t the first time something like that had happened, where he had taken too long to put the pieces together.  All thinkers had their weaknesses and catches – all powers, probably, but thinkers were what he was most familiar with, and thinkers almost always had their issues with the mind.  The problems of the mind were difficult to identify and fix, because they were so invisible, and the tools for diagnosis were often what part of what was broken or altered.He had taken a considerable length of time to figure out the nuances of his power, too.  The most obvious aspect was that he could see through walls, but he lost the ability to see and understand people, to see their faces or easily grasp the clothes they wore.There was so much more to it, and he was learning more of it every week and month.  The colors meant things, and he had only worked out the blues and the reds.  Other colors separated from the white at times.  There were a lot of greens in the crowd and along the station, pulling away from the outlines.  He had ideas about what they meant, but he couldn’t say anything with confidence.The fractures and formations in distortions around people were another part of it.  There were elements to the way things broke up and distorted that had deeper meaning, things he didn’t understand in a way he could explain, but which made it easy for him to relate one personality and personality type to another, familiar one.The portal took up much of the station in front of him.  His multifaceted senses covered the tract of Gimel surrounding the portal, and the areas of Bet on the far side.  His view encompassed the surroundings on the other side, the people, the terrain, and the different colors that bled out from the sharper white outlines.You’re in the weeds, Relay communicated.Crystalclear lifted his walkie-talkie to his mouth.  “Weeds?”Not entirely with us.  Lost, or in a bit of a daze.Crystalclear looked out beyond the portal.  At the people amassed around it, human-shaped outlines with the outlines of clothes, blurs smearing around the white lines, their heads replaced with fractured, kaleidoscopic messes.  A large group were in eerie unison.  Singing together, possibly, or chanting.“Yeah,” he replied, one more word for what others would perceive as a one-sided conversation.It was his perpetual reality.  To be mundane, or to be lost.  The knowledge out of his reach, there if he could find out how to reach for it or connect it.He focused more on the crowd.His difficulty wasn’t in tracking everyone, so much as it was finding the right angles.  He didn’t have eyes with his power deployed like this, and he wasn’t limited to one point of view.  He set about making sure he could investigate everyone and their carry-on baggage without anyone being hidden with their outline closely matching someone they were standing in front of or behind.He didn’t move his head as he looked back, up the stairs and out at the loosely organized lines of people.  The trio had joined the line.He used the phone, “The three people Relay wanted you guys to keep an eye out for just joined the line.  They’re behind a shorter, elderly couple.  One of them’s agitated.”“Thank you, Crystalclear,” the voice on the phone replied.While more of his focus was dwelling in that direction and area, making sure he was seeing everything from the necessary angles, he became aware of two people who others were paying a great deal of attention to.One of them was tall, somewhat muscular, but what stood out was the storm of fractures around his head, overlapping without connecting to one another.  A crown of thorns, fashioned from something that looked like especially precise breaks in glass or deep-etched frost.The other was smaller, hunched over.  She was almost the opposite, the breaks vague, cracking out to reach like a whip, aimed at nothing in particular.He used the walkie-talkie, “I think our relief just turned up.”Making my way to you.Relay and the two individuals reached Crystalclear’s booth at the same time.  Crystalclear stepped out, aware of the number of people who were turning to look.  He tried to keep an eye on the crowd.Relay made the introductions.  “Crystalclear, this is Big Picture, and this is Ratcatcher.”“Hello,” Big Picture said.  More tight loops of breakage encircled his head rapidfire as he turned it to look at Crystalclear, and the loops bled like purple watercolor paint.“Hello,” Crystalclear said.“Hello.  We’re the reinforthmenth,” Ratcatcher said, with a heavy lisp.“You’re new to Foresight?” Big Picture asked.“I am,” Crystalclear said.  “Only positives so far.”“I thought about joining,” Big Picture said.  “I decided it was better to wait until things settled down.  For now, I get paid for this, I keep it simple.”“Yeth.  Thimple ith good,” Ratcatcher said.“I like the costume,” Big Picture said.Crystalclear touched the tunic portion of his outfit.It wasn’t anything like he’d worn with the Norfair Neighborhood Heroes.  A single shoulderpad, a piece of cloth forming a kind of shawl or mantle as it extended from one corner of the shoulderpad near his heart, over his shoulder, and around to the back corner of the shoulderpad near his shoulderblade.  The shoulderpad, the armor at his wrists and the armor around his legs had chunks of crystal, closely matched to the crystal that he naturally produced.  Lightweight as armor went, limited to a few pieces that were as decorative as functional, but it was still armor.  A band of metal ran along his chin’s edge, and that took some particular getting used to.“Appreciated,” Crystalclear said.  It was odd to reply when he was only aware of the outlines of the outfit.  He had seen it in the mirror when he had been getting ready, but that memory felt faint, and he had yet to see how put together he looked with the crystals at the upper half of his face.“I’m going to go get back to work,” Relay said.  “I’ll be in communication.”Crystalclear returned to his seat.  Big Picture stood out in the open, his arms folded.Ratcatcher joined Crystalclear in the booth, sitting on the counter by the phone.“What do you do, Crythtalclear?” Ratcatcher asked.“I see through walls.  I can see contraband.”“I can too,” Ratcatcher said.  “I thee thmall thingth, wherever they are.”“We might be redundant then.”“Redundancy can help,” Big Picture said.“Can you share your power, Big Picture?”Big picture turned his head.  Crystalclear wished he could see the big guy’s face.  Knowing if the guy was frowning or smiling would help a great deal.“It’s redundancy,” Big Picture said.  He made a sound, almost a laugh.  “Everything I want to focus on, I clone my brain and my mind.  I can give each and every detail every bit of my attention, and I can slow down my perceptions if I want to study it more.  There are a few other nuances, other things I can do with the parallel takes, sharing, but you don’t need all of the details.”“You can spend the equivalent of a few minutes studying every possible clue?” Crystalclear asked.“Weeks.  Months, if I want.”“Sounds as if it could have its drawbacks.”“Don’t we all?” Big Picture asked.Crystalclear was aware that Ratcatcher wasn’t alone.  He turned his head a little, then pointed at the pocket of Ratcatcher’s top.  It was a sleeveless top, tight-fitting in the way a costume was supposed to be, but it had a hoodie-like pouch in the front.  There was a small life form in there, the thing’s perspective fuzzy in a way that suggested it was asleep, in whole or in part.Ratcatcher made a pleased sound, then reached into the pouch.  The disturbance woke the creature, but she didn’t act like it was upset as she held it in her two hands.Crystalclear could guess what the thing was from its dimensions and Ratcatcher’s name.  “Does it have a name?”“Raththputin,” Ratcatcher said.  She picked up a walkie-talkie, “The attractive older gentleman in the peacoat, hairy earth and eyelatheth to die for.  Thomething thown into the coat.  Naughty.”“…I can see Ratcatcher has joined us…” the walkie talkie buzzed in response.  The buzzing turned into crackling.  “…nimize colorful commenta…”“Radio’th garbage today,” Ratcatcher observed.“It is.”“I’m sorry we’re late,” Big Picture said.  “Feels like we took a step backward, citywide.  There’s word of a potential transportation strike.  Our usual bus driver didn’t show, we had to wait for the next.  Construction sites between NYC and Boston are locked down, they aren’t doing anything except getting in the way.”“Feels like we should be out there, not here,” Crystalclear said.“I know that feeling.  It’s often a trap.”Crystalclear turned toward Big Picture.“I joined the military, before I got powers.  I was thinking something similar when I did.  That things at home were shit, but I was needed out there.  We didn’t fix anything out there, and we came home to find things were worse.”Crystalclear was going to reply, but he was interrupted by the lisping young woman.“Buckthom lady thtepping off the train,” Ratcatcher said.  “Bra that doethn’t fit, run in her thtocking.  Cavity thearch, if you pleathe.”“This isn’t you being funny again, Rat?” Big Picture asked.“I’m being good, thank you very mush.”Crystalclear looked.  There was something suspended in the middle of the blur that was the woman.  He held up his walkie-talkie.  “Seconding Ratcatcher on this one.  She’s got something stowed.”I see her, Relay communicated.  Noise surrounding her is similar to a few others we spotted earlier.“I remember,” Crystalclear said, through the walkie talkie.  He’d noticed but he hadn’t been sure how common it was or how much of a thread ran through it all until he’d had it point out.  That weakness of his again.  “There have been one or two of these small-time smugglers on every train, all day.”Big Picture said, “It might be worth checking what’s going on in Bet.  Could be a gang, strong-arming people into going through, or offering a head start in Gimel if they’ll smuggle something through.”“It might not go that well,” Crystalclear said.  “Too easy to get sucked in right from the start, not being allowed to leave once you’ve made that delivery.”“The ugly kid with the runny nothe hath clutter in hith bag.  Thyringeth.”“…heckin…” the radio crackled.Big Picture picked up his walkie talkie, “The woman with him isn’t his mother, either.  Better to have them get picked out of line and taken away for an interview.”The radio crackled with the affirmative.Slowly, the train and the platform emptied.  They kept an eye out for the drugs, for the violence, for the people who were especially angry or scared.One of the train cars remained filled.  Crystalclear looked through, and saw the people within sitting, calm, not reaching for their things.“What’s the status of car five?” he asked.  “There are a few guns in there.”Ratcatcher pulled the keyboard closer to her, she typed and then responded, “Thpecial cathe.  VIP.”“They’ve got a case fifty-three in there.”“Weld, according to the computer.  Ethcorting.”“Weld,” Crystalclear said.  He was familiar with the name.  “Good to know.”Crowd is thinning out, Relay communicated.  I’ll go say hi.Crystalclear watched as people sorted out.  The platform emptied, and the officers on the scene did what they could to get others moving along, helping with bags and pointing people in the right direction.“You’re bleeding,” Ratcatcher observed.“Me?” Crystalclear asked.“At the corner of your eye,” she said.He checked, touching the spot in question and finding the bead of blood with his sense of touch.  Sure enough, she was right.  “It’s a thing that happens.  Doesn’t mean anything.  Excuse me.”“Eckthuthed,” she said.He touched one of the crystals that was sticking up and out of that eye socket, gripped it, and hauled it free.  He could feel the glass edge slide against the inside of his eyelid, the root of it hauling free of the floor of his eye socket, and he could feel the fluids inside his eye stir.“You jutht made it worth,” she said.“I’m fine.  I never bleed for long.  I try to be careful, so I don’t scare people, but it doesn’t bother me much.”“Good to know,” she said.  “I know all about that.”He pulled it free, a foot-long block of crystal, and laid it carefully down on the counter.  He blinked a few times with his one eye, noticed that Ratcatcher had taken off her mask, gray furred and full-face, and decided to keep his gaze averted, for privacy’s sake, and because looking at her would let her see his face.He concentrated, and he produced another chunk of glass, feeling it stab from the underside of his eye and out, sliding through everything in the way without doing real damage.  He was careful to shape it in his mind so there wouldn’t be any sharp edges resting against his eyelid or brow.He turned his face Ratcatcher’s way.  “How do I look?  Symmetrical?”“Yeth.”“Thank you,” he said.“Thank you,” she said, with emphasis on the ‘you’.“Why?”“Not many people look me in the fathe when my mathk is off and keep from flinching,” she said.Crystalclear’s response was cut short.Weld wants us, Relay said.  Diplomatic thing.“Weld is asking for me,” Crystalclear said.  “Good luck, guys.”“We’ll get to know each other, I’m sure,” Big Picture said.“Good luck,” Ratcatcher said.Relay was already coordinating the officers.  The path that led from platform to the intake center was being closed off, a metal shuttered door sliding closed.  Another set of doors were being unlocked and opened.VIPs indeed, it seemed, and from what Crystalclear could see, they were only human.Crystalclear approached the train car, standing beside Relay.  Weld and Narwhal were standing nearby.Narwhal looked rather spectacular to Crystalclear’s vision, given the emphasis on outlines, and her having dressed up in very small, outlined objects.“Look after them,” she said.  “I’ll see the way is clear.”“Got it,” Weld said.  “You would be Crystalclear?”“Yes.”“Good to meet you.  I didn’t think you were one of us.”“Oh, I’m not.  I can go from this to… not this,” Crystalclear said.  He was suddenly aware he wasn’t sure what terminology was okay or not okay with the C-53s.“That’s good to hear.  Closer to Narwhal than anything, then.  I’ve heard good things, Crystalclear.  Foresight is lucky to have you.”“Thank you.  Likewise, with you and the Wardens.”“Were you around for that broken trigger incident a week and a half ago?”“I was,” Crystalclear said.  “I wasn’t in a position to do much.”“This situation here follows from that.  We’ve got visitors, and we want to keep things calm and safe.  Foresight said we should make use of you and Relay to help keep an eye on things.”“Ah,” Crystalclear said.  “Alright.”There was a pause.  “Are you okay to do this?”“Yeah,” Crystalclear said.  He realized he didn’t sound confident, and tried again.  “Yeah.”He wasn’t sure it was alright.  He’d been volunteered for something and he hadn’t explicitly been told.  It was a level of disconnection from the authority that felt uncomfortably familiar and disconcerting.It made him think of his aunt.  It also made him think of Big Picture’s statements about it being better to wait.“We’re bodyguards and protection for the Gimel side of things.  The other guys brought their own protection.”The other guys? Crystalclear thought.All thinkers had their weaknesses.  Most hated not knowing things.  Most, by way of how their powers gave them an edge in one respect, had a way of missing other things.  Crystalclear’s vision gave him a lot, but it made some obvious things impossible to grasp.Crystalclear’s focus broadened as he tried to take in everything necessary to keep an eye on things.  He looked at the crowd, noted who was reacting to the shutters being closed, and tried to keep tabs on them.  He watched the other heroes, tracked the officers, and tried to wrap his head around the fractured messes that were their heads and the ever-shifting contents of those heads.“Ratcatcher seemed to take to you,” Relay commented.“Did she?” Crystalclear asked.“That’s the impression I got.  You didn’t seem too bothered, either.”“She seemed like a nice kid.  Weird but good.”Relay made a small sound.  “Don’t, uh, say that around her.  She’s older than you.  Heh.”Crystalclear smiled, but he felt just a little anxious.  There were things he had liked about the NNH group with Tempera, Longscratch and Fume Hood.  Big Picture had talked about the merits of simplicity.Thinker issues.  He hated being out of the loop.  It constantly felt like he was.  Even when it was with things that pertained to himself.“Sorry,” Relay said.  He’d apparently picked something up.“It’s okay,” Crystalclear said.The group was departing the train, now.“We’ll be using the emergency stairwell,” Relay said.  “We go upstairs, we’ll find a vantage point, they’ll have their meeting with the people who are already waiting there, then a few of them are going to go tour Gimel.  Things are out of our hands once they do, they’ve been warned about that.  The newcomers want to see the city they’ve been helping to build.”“I heard about some of this,” Crystalclear said.  “These are people from an alternate Earth?”He didn’t get his answer, as the people approached.Three men, with their entourage, men with guns.  Their heads were interesting.  Leader and soldier, they were very in sync, much like the group that was still gathered outside the Bet portal were of similar minds as they chanted or sang together.  They felt like an odd fit.  Foreign worlders?Leaders of Earth Cheit.  Abrahamic theocrats.  They’re our guests, here about the people of theirs who died in the broken trigger incident.  A serious subject.  Crystalclear was aware of a few other things that had come up in regard to the group, until the broken trigger had consumed everyone’s attention.  The discussions in the late-night media had been derailed by the deaths of the ninety-two individuals caught by the broken trigger.“If you’ll follow us,” Weld said.They walked up the stairs, with Weld in front, and Relay and Crystalclear toward the rear.  The armed guard trailed even further behind, with one waiting at the base of the stairwell.They had a bit of a distance to walk to reach the room at the top.  It looked like a ball room, with fancy curtains, a lacquered floor, and lots of empty space.  A table was set to one side, and there were curtains closed that didn’t stop the light from passing through.  Sheers, possibly, to obscure the view of the world outside, or perhaps more importantly, to obscure those on the outside from seeing those within.People were seated at the table already, paperwork around them.The one closest to the door was a serious looking woman, slender, in a blouse and a skirt that highlighted how narrow she was.  The belt of her skirt cinched in at the waist, emphasizing her figure.  She had a lot of the anxiety that the refugees departing the train had had, but she didn’t show it in how she sat or how she moved as she stood to greet the men.Sierra Kiley, Relay communicated.  Board member of Rock Bay Reconstruction Group.  That’s one of the biggest construction firms, with its roots in Brockton Bay.  She’s a candidate for mayor of the Megalopolis, but she’s not expected to win.  Foresight thinks she has her hat in the ring for other reasons.  Access, possibly.  We know she has ties to organized crime, if you couldn’t guess from her background in Brockton Bay.  She doesn’t necessarily know we know.Next were a couple, male and female.  She wore a nice suit-dress.  He wore a dress shirt, slacks, and carried the paperwork.  Their focus was sharp, they clearly worked well together from how well they coordinated.  As with Big Picture, there was something else going on with the man’s perceptions.  He wasn’t a cone- his perceptions were covering a lot of ground, and his fractures were very different from the norm.  They were closer to being etches.Jeanne Wynn and her assistant.  CEO of Mortari, second of the large construction groups.  Jeanne might be too.  She’s a more serious candidate for mayor, she’s running, she and a lot of others think she’ll win.Crystalclear was bothered that he was getting filled in on things he already had some knowledge of, but felt disconnected in other things.  He’d known about Jeanne.  She had recently put up her proposals online, for how she wanted and expected to run things if she won.The person who won mayorship of Gimel, if they weren’t killed in an uprising, would likely go on to be leader of Gimel as a whole.We suspect the assistant is a parahuman.  He was, Crystalclear knew.  He resolved to communicate that when he could.Others were named and identified by Relay.  Mr. Nieves, another prospective mayor, though he didn’t have the footing the others did, his chances were better than Ms. Kiley’s.  Mr. Buckner was at the forefront of the burgeoning media enterprise in Gimel, bringing television to the masses.Stay put and stay silent.The voice wasn’t Relay’s, but it was easy to imagine as Relay’s, with it being so vivid.Crystalclear had a confused and fractured memory of his early childhood.  The woman he remembered growing up with was not the woman he’d spent his late childhood and adolescence with.  His aunt had explained the situation for him, saying his mother hadn’t been well, he’d been taken away from her for his safety.She had said a lot of things over the years.  He had believed most, and because other things had occupied his attention, he hadn’t given the remainder enough focus.Normally, trigger events emphasizing isolation, loss, cut ties, and betrayal tended to lead to master powers.  Or, rather, master powers tended to go to people who were going to deal with those situations.Any attachment he had felt to his aunt had faded over the years, long before he had triggered.  She hadn’t cared.  So long as he behaved and didn’t cause a fuss, she had been happy to not have to devote much attention to him.  There was nothing lost, so that aspect of things hadn’t factored in.So, naturally, he had avoided causing a fuss.It had only been later that their fragile reality had come crashing down around them.  The police were closing in on him, he was no longer young, and where a young, clean cut white boy had flown under the radar, a teenaged white boy with pimples hadn’t.   It had turned out that his aunt wasn’t his aunt at all.  Her only relation to him was that she had stolen him from his real mother.The questions had come, hours of interrogation, his lawyer guiding him.  Hadn’t he put the pieces together?  Hadn’t he seen?  Why hadn’t he asked more questions?  He hadn’t looked at what he was delivering to homes even once in the past few years?No, he’d said.  No, he’d never looked.  He had never really considered.  He had only wanted to exist.The police had been upset, angry, hostile.  His lawyer had been frustrated, because anything, anything at all could have led to a plea deal or him getting off free.  His ‘aunt’ and her boyfriend were upset, because they blamed him for their being arrested, and they had used a proxy to threaten him.He had been sufficiently scared and lost to trigger.Now he stood guard.  He was trying to exist, to do what good he could, and he wanted to pay a little more attention than he once had, even as his power made that very easy on the surface and very difficult when it came to the deeper analysis.The initial introductions were wrapping up.  The theocrats of Cheit were saying a brief prayer, heads bowed.People settled into their seats, empty seats between groups, serving as a kind of separation.“War.”One word.  It had been said by the lead theocrat, no preamble, and it was enough to be followed by silence.“I say it not because I believe in it or want it,” he went on, “But because the people at home wanted me to convey it.”“We’ve had a strong working relationship thus far,” Jeanne said.“We have,” the theocrat said.“Forgive me,” Nieves said.  “I’m lost.  It came up before, but things got in the way.  What exactly is the working relationship?”Jeanne explained, “Cheit has graciously provided Earth Gimel with supplies for reconstruction.  They supplied us with food and other things that enabled us to weather the first winter.  A hard season.”“I remember,” Nieves said.  “I know this much.  But what exactly did Cheit get in the bargain?”“Goodwill,” the theocrat said.“Goodwill?” Nieves asked.“We have an awful lot of very awful people at our disposal, to put things lightly,” Kiley said.  “We don’t really think anyone wants actual war, do we?”“As I was instructed, I brought it up,” the theocrat said.  “It is officially on the table.”Crystalclear was still, listening.  He didn’t miss the glance that Weld and Narwhal shared.  Neither of them budged an inch.“Goodwill is a matter of faith,” Jeanne said.  “The understanding was that they would share their excess, out of the goodness of their hearts.  We, in turn, would manage our own.”“Six of Earth Cheit’s citizens are dead.  Five godly men and a woman, all with their families.  By all accounts, they died in a terrible, protracted way.”“Because of a broken trigger,” Jeanne said.  “Outside of our control.  Surely you understand.”“These ‘triggers’, as we understand it, are the result of strife and upset.  Your people were upset because of how Mortari and RBR have handled your subordinates.”Crystalclear watched carefully, his eyes on all of the people present, on the nearby rooftops, and on the area below, to make sure nobody was attempting entry.Jeanne and the theocrat seemed to be the ones in control over this conversation.  Jeanne had a parahuman with her, and the parahuman was studying the room, but nothing suggested he was communicating with his superior.  Nothing about the way things refracted and moved around his head, nothing about the colors.  Purple here and there, but spotty, brief.If she was a superior at all, that was.  It was very possible the ‘assistant’ was the one truly in charge.“What would you have us do?” Kiley asked.The theocrat answered, “We want you to be in control.  Control your people, organize, avoid similar situations.  We are happy to be generous to our less fortunate neighbors, but we cannot have your troubles become our troubles.”“We’re working on that,” Kiley said.“Are you married, Ms. Kiley?” the theocrat asked.“I don’t see how that’s relevant.”“That would be a no, then.  I prefer to work with married individuals, like Mrs. Wynn here.  They understand the difficulties of a long term relationship, the compromises and deeper knowledge it takes to make things work.”“I wouldn’t be where I am if I wasn’t competent.  Trust me, Mr. Aguirre, I’ve earned my place.”“So I’ve heard,” the theocrat answered.  His tone was such that it was as cutting a response as an outright denial or dismissal.  “Mrs. Wynn, you’re prepared to organize and control things?”“We’ve already taken steps.  You’ll see measurable change in coming weeks.”“Good.  Ms. Kiley, you’re welcome to prove me wrong in my judgment about you.  A lot depends on this.  We are happy to keep supplying you with everything you could need, we believe in generosity, but it’s contingent on your successes.  We know which pies each of you have your fingers in.  If one of you succeed, we’ll gladly back you.  If both succeed, we’ll back you both.  If others step up and prove themselves, we’ll back them.”“Provided we do well enough at making the most of what you provide.”“Please don’t disappoint,” the theocrat said.  He placed his hand on the paperwork in front of him.  “You know what’s on the table.”Ms. Kiley said, “I don’t think I’m in your good books, Mr. Aguirre, I think I don’t lower myself any further in your eyes by saying this-”“What you say or don’t say has little to do with what I feel about you, Ms. Kiley.  I believe in deeds.”“-You do not want a war with Gimel.  We have so very little to lose, and I can tell you, I know this very well.  We have some very awful people at our disposal.  You can threaten bombs and armies.  We can threaten nightmares come to life and life turned to nightmares.”“I believe you,” Aguirre said.  “I know the kinds of people you interact with, Ms. Kiley.  Part of the reason I’m here is that I’ve worked directly with some individuals and situations of that breed, who appeared in Cheit.  I wish I could say with confidence that I could make the people I report to believe the same.  They would need to see it with their own eyes, and by then it would be too late.”“That’s possible,” Kiley said.“I’ve laid out what the people in charge believe.  I can report your feelings on this and come back another day, but I don’t think this is liable to change.  They want security, you want supply.”“Succinctly put,” Jeanne said.“Tell me what you would need, if we were to extend good faith and renew supply for your construction.”“Construction is stalled.  Transportation is stalling.  Crime is surging,” Nieves said.“Which are things we’ll get a handle on,” Jeanne said, tersely.  “Yes, please, let’s talk supply.  Concrete, lumber, and food, to start with.”“Let me see, paperwork, papers, thank you, Charles.”The discussion continued.Crystalclear held his tongue, but he could see the way the constructions around the other parahumans’ heads were operating, the cracks that were forming and gathering, and the bleeding of the colors.  Blue-green tints, for many.⊙“They’ve been giving us supply for nothing?” Nieves asked, raising his voice.  “You idiots.  You’ve profited off of their so-called generosity, but you’ve been selling us out.”“They were going to look for a foothold, whatever we did,” Jeanne said.  “They wanted security, and that wouldn’t change whatever we did.  Allowing them to help provided some of that security.”“It provided them leverage and the impression they have a say in how Gimel is run!”“They do have a say.  They’re our neighbors, and they outnumber us,” Kiley said.  She sounded tired.The theocrats had departed.  The people had changed seats, to sit closer together.  Jackets had been removed and hung on the backs of chairs, waters and coffees obtained.  The discussion continued, on a different front.  A scattered, small group of people trying to find a way forward against a very large, united group.The argument continued, heated, terse.  Standing around the edges of the room, the parahumans exchanged looks, then walked over to where the coffee and water was being supplied.“What do you think?” Weld asked.  Narwhal stood beside him.“Jeanne has been in contact with Cheit for a long time,” Relay said.  “Since Gold Morning?”“Her assistant is a parahuman,” Crystalclear said.  “Something about the way his head is put together.  Thinker.  They may have been communicating, maybe not.”“Kiley was communicating with people throughout.  Earpiece,” Relay said.  “You didn’t see?”“Heads and surrounding objects get murky,” Crystalclear said, his voice quiet.“We asked you two here for a reason,” Narwhal said.  “You have strong backgrounds, and people see you as trustworthy.”“Foresight is taking on a role as Wardens adjunct,” Weld said.  “A… discreet role.”“You want us to be your watchdogs,” Crystalclear said.“They’re keeping too close an eye on the Wardens themselves.  We could use observers and more covert operatives.”“Watching them?” Crystalclear asked, tilting his head toward the window.  He tilted his head toward the table.  “Or watching them?”“That you asked proves we were right to ask,” Weld said.Crystalclear bit his tongue.  His instinct was to say Weld was wrong.  That he was the wrong person.  He missed critical things, by consequence of his power being what it was.He’d joined the NNH to change things, to be a real piece in something greater, rather than a cog in the machine, and that had fallen to pieces.But by saying all of that that, he would be relegating himself to Big Picture’s small-picture view of the world.  Subsisting, looking after refugees, doing small things, instead of what he’d hoped for with the NNH.  He would be saying he didn’t have what it took.“I’m in,” Relay said.  “But you already guessed that.”“Yes,” Narwhal said.  “Crystalclear?”Crystalclear nodded.  “I will.  One question, though.”“Ask.”“If you have us doing this, what do you have Advance Guard and the Attendant doing?”                                                                                           Glare – 3.1                                                                                           Cities, like people, got their second chances.  Few cities had needed one so badly as this.  I was left hoping the other cities were doing better with their second opportunities, because nothing I was seeing was very promising, here.The four teams under the Wardens’ umbrella, now condensed down to three, were divided into those who wanted to return to the way things had been and those who wanted to forge a new way forward, learning from the mistakes of the past.  The appeal of returning to a semblance of what we’d had was clear- we missed the foods, the places, the familiar businesses and media, the familiar faces.We wanted normal and even now every meal, every soap we used, every piece of clothing, it was a reminder of how far from normal we were.  It was different and often less because we had less, and we had less of a footing.  I wasn’t the only person who felt their stomach sink when we saw the news two weeks after the broken trigger had decimated the reconstruction workers’ protest, saying that the transportation strike was imminent, and that factory workers were contemplating joining in, an across-the-board attempt to demand stability and structure.It was important, a line had to be drawn and the endless talks about what our government would look like needed to end, but I still saw the reports and I knew the foods, clothes, and routine I wanted were going to have to wait that much longer.That was one of the prevailing arguments for normal, for going back.  This section of the city, this settlement, was the counterpoint.Brockton Bay had been a port, growing as the industry did.  A lot of what made it work as a fledgling port city made New Brockton work as one of our first footholds in Earth Gimel.  Lumber, quarrying, some surface level minerals, and geography protected from the harshest sweeps of cold weather from the north.The industry had become a prominent part of the city, and then the greater industry had outgrown it.  Things had reached the point where it was easier to take one big ship and go to Boston and transport goods from there than to take two smaller ships and go to Brockton Bay, even if Brockton Bay was closer to the goods’ destination.  The factories and goods went where the ships went, because it wasn’t sensible to ship raw materials from Boston to Brockton Bay to do manufacturing when Boston could handle it.New Brockton felt like it sat on that brink between relevance and ruin.  As a settlement, it was defined by tall buildings and the edifices of heavy industry.  There were ships finding their way past each other on the water and big brick buildings with black plumes of smoke rising from their chimneys.  Already back to the ways of an era that predated me, cutting corners to produce more at a cost to tomorrow.  It was crowded and bursting at the seams, and it had been for a while now, trying to grow despite the constraints of water and mountain around it.It didn’t escape me that the settlement continued to chug along while the gears and belts of the greater megalopolis were grinding to a stop under strikes and shutdowns.I walked, rather than fly, because the directions I’d been given mandated it.  I suspected it was intentional.  I knew there were eyes on me, I knew who some of those eyes belonged to, and I had strong suspicions about others.The racist graffiti no longer dominated downtown, though I did see some, with half of it partially painted over or altered.  Many of the people who had lived and thrived in Brockton Bay had made their way here, after all.  An attempt had been made to use wall space, to give the tenements-and-factories color when mirrored windows on skycrapers didn’t steal it from the sky or water.  Murals now decorated many of the walls and building fronts, no doubt an attempt to leave less open wall space for the gang tags and symbols.  Animals and symbols of humanity like clasped hands covered residential areas.  Green trees, branches, and lush mountains painted almost ironically on the sides of factories and power plants.There were places that mirrored home, in layout and the buildings that had been placed.  The area that had been the Towers at the southwest corner of the city was still the Towers.  Downtown was still where Downtown had been.  A Lord Street stabbed north-to-south through the settlement.  Despite the attempts, it wasn’t home.  It came from something different.Such was the counterpoint: in attempting to paint a picture of home, we might distort or create a caricature of that picture.  If we rushed it or forced it, we risked making some of the same fundamental mistakes we’d made before, building on cracked foundations.Seeing the murals, the directions I’d received started to make sense.  The path was byzantine.  Go the way the wolf and his cubs are looking.  A wolf and three cubs that looked like they were made of white smoke were painted on a concrete wall.  They stood facing one way, but their heads were looking back.Walk beneath the leaping rabbit.  A rabbit decorated an arch at the edge of a children’s park.  The park felt small and lonely amid larger, taller buildings, partially fenced in, with room for two swings, a slide, a sandbox and one basketball half-court that would have to be vacated if a car came through to use the parking garage or if the dump truck came for the dumpster at the back of a building.Follow the snake.If I hadn’t known it was a snake, I might not have realized what it was.  It was sectioned off, the skeleton of a winding serpent with each vertebrae several feet from the other.  Three white pieces along one wall, a white-painted drain cover, then more segments on the wall opposite.The painted lines of a crosswalk took me across the street.  I followed more segments of the snake to reach one of the larger apartment complexes, four identical L-shaped buildings framing a plaza.  The bottom floors of the buildings and the lowest floors along the inside of each ‘L’ had some basic stores.Two years ago, this would have been one of the nicer areas in Earth Gimel, if a little basic.  No-name grocery store, clothing store, and home-goods store.  It was dated already, and I could already imagine two years from now, when various murals might be faded or defaced, when the metal chairs and tables would be rusted, the stores closed or forgotten.  The snake cut through the plaza, which could have seated two hundred people, but currently had six.  Any earlier and there would have been people having a late lunch.  Any later and it would be time for an early dinner or an after-work bite to eat.A tunnel led through the body of one of the apartment buildings, leading from plaza to parking lot.  The mural of a cat with its back twisting and arching was painted on the walls and roof.  Its paws stuck out and across the footpath firmly pressed down on the snake’s neck.‘Wait’ was the last instruction.I checked my phone.  One message:K:



K.I flicked my thumb, spun up the music player and then fished my earbuds out of the pocket of my jacket.  I put only one in, so I could keep one ear out for trouble.I waited long enough for five songs to start and stop.  A pair of people arrived at the plaza, got their food, ate, and left, before anything happened.  I wondered more than once if I’d been baited to come here as a way of making me waste time.“You get fifteen minutes.”I turned my head in the direction of the parking lot, turning off my music and pulling the ear-bud free.  I moved my hand in a circle to catch most of the length of cord in a loop.Tattletale had reversed her costume colors from black on lavender to a more royal purple on black.  The same pattern of lines slashing across her costume remained- horizontal line across the upper chest, vertical line slashing down from that, to form a stylized ‘T’.  Another horizontal line jutted out from halfway down, followed by another vertical line piercing that line, a smaller ‘t’ nestled under the right arm of its big brother.  She wasn’t the type to get photographed or caught clearly on video, and it was painted in such broad strokes that I suspected many people missed it.It kind of smacked of narcissism, I felt, to wear one’s initials.  The more black costume, at least, looked more distinguished.  Her hair needed a bit of combing, like it had been tousled by the wind and it hadn’t been fixed.She was followed by a flurry of small birds that settled on the street by the exit of the alley, and by one bodyguard.  The cape was burly, wearing a skintight suit that showed off his muscles, and wore a heavy cloth hood with eyeholes cut out, a series of ‘x’ stitches forming a frowny-face.  The lines around his eyes were cut deep.  Very weary.  He stood with his hands clasped behind him.On the other side of the tunnel, one of the men that had been eating in the plaza had approached.  He now stood with his back ramrod straight, his hands clasped behind him.  Very clean cut, hair short and styled, recently shaved, t-shirt, black slacks, and shiny black shoes.I knew Tattletale knew how my forcefield worked.  If the man had a gun, he was potentially a danger to me.“I like the cat,” I said, pointing.  “Subtle.”“Fifteen minutes, Vicky,” Tattletale said.  “It’s going to be a lot less if you want to make small talk.  If this becomes you wagging your finger at me and acting all holier-than-thou, I’m walking.  I’m busy these days.  The only reason I’m giving you time out of my day is hometown respect.”I fished in my pocket.  I pulled out the paper.  “This isn’t because you wanted to talk to me?”“When you’re positioned like I am, you can’t ever do one thing.  That message was intended to do a few things at once.”“I couldn’t help but notice your use of ‘Glory Hole’.  Seemed unnecessarily antagonistic.”She leaned against the wall by the cat’s head and smiled at me.  “One, I’m unnecessarily antagonistic.  Two, it serves to let you know who the letter is from, it pushes you off balance if you’re in a position to be easily put off balance, which I would want to know about, and finally, three, if the messenger is the type to ignore my instructions, read the letter and try using that phrasing against you, then they’re liable to get hurt.  That makes it clear I’m to be listened to.  Cleat isn’t the brightest, and he could stand to learn that lesson.”“And you wanting to talk to me wasn’t one of your reasons?”“That’s something else entirely.  I offered Hollow Point three asks at a significant discount.  Three times they can reach out to me and get info, now that they’ve paid.  I did this to get them into my debt, to see if they were intelligent enough to ask good questions, and to get them used to paying me money for intel.  If that tide somehow rises, I want my fortunes to rise with it.  You turned up, and they wanted to know, were you the first of a larger group of heroes who were going to make a move?  Who were you, and what role did you play?”“And your response was this?”“Multiple purposes, Vicky.  Keep up.  If you don’t care enough you decide it’s not worth it and leave.  Unlikely.  You could get a little upset, and in the doing you reveal what you’re up to.  Or you’re invested on some level, and you reach out, and the dialogue is opened.  If the dialogue is opened, I’m better equipped to deal with you and to deal with Hollow Point.  How the dialogue is opened tells me a lot, too.  You could have come charging after me.  You didn’t.  You asked around for how to contact me, used a liaison, and you respected my direction and my rules in my part of the city.”My part of the city, I thought.  Yeah.  Impressions verified – New Brockton had retained many of the problems of its predecessor.“Cedar Point isn’t yours?” I asked.She shrugged.  “We’ll see what it ends up being.  For now, you’ve got people of Cleat’s caliber there.”“I asked around a bit before leaving.”“I know.”“The construction work dried up, people are moving elsewhere.   Nothing was drawing people in.  Then, in the span of a few days, a large number of people buy apartments, homes, and other properties.  Never mind the fact that there isn’t a lot going on there.  Now a lot of supervillains are making themselves comfortable, figuring out who’ll work with them and who won’t.  Some places and people might be open to them doing business, others are already feeling the pressure to leave, scary people hanging around and intimidating them.  People of Cleat’s caliber, maybe, but an awful lot of them.”“It’s not the only place.  It’s the biggest of them,” Tattletale said.  “All the itinerant and teamless villains needed to settle somewhere eventually.  Hollow Point is just loose enough they won’t necessarily kill each other, but self preservation keeps them together and following some basic rules.  Some charisma here and there steers them.”“New Brockton doesn’t count?” I asked.“Different thing.  Hollow Point is the largest place without a major player heading things.  So far.  New Brockton obviously has its major players securely in place.”“And even though that neighborhood isn’t yours and isn’t even close to yours, you want me gone?”“No,” she said.  “You want you gone, if you know what’s good for you.  You don’t want to get involved with that.  You might make headway, but it won’t last.  You’re outnumbered, they’ve got better resources, and if you ever succeed to any measurable degree, they can do things like call in the second of the asks they bought from me.  Then they get an answer, and you have a bad day.”“Alright,” I said.  I glanced back.  The man standing at the edge of the plaza hadn’t budged.  The brute with the bag over his head hadn’t either.“If it’s not me they ask, then it’s someone else, and you potentially have an even worse day.  I know you hate my guts, but the reality is I’m one of the nice ones.”There were a lot of responses I could give to that.  I bit my tongue.I released my tongue and said, “Hypothetically, if you don’t mind hypotheticals…”“I’m a great fan of the hypothetical.”“…If I asked you where you suggested going, if Cedar Point isn’t workable or if it’s untouchable because someone like you is going to step in before any heroes make headway… what places would you suggest?  Outside of the established jurisdictions for teams.”“I wouldn’t suggest anything.  It’s a wild west out there and there’s no place for you out there.  Not anymore.”I folded my arms.  I’d expected an answer like this.“The people who win are the people with clout.  While you were teaching school kids which direction a gun should point or hauling water out to the refugees still back on Bet, the rest of us were working.  I and people like me were getting our hooks in and laying groundwork to build something behind the scenes.  Taking over corner worlds, finding footholds in this world, starting up businesses, establishing reputations.  The big hero teams have some influence because they’ve been recruiting and they staked out their territory.  Hero and villain, we’re the major players, but we operate the same fundamental way.  We’re scary.  The thinkers, the masters, the masterminds, and the people with the biggest guns.”“And Cedar Point?”“Cedar Point, if you want to call it that, and its sister locations are late to the game.  They have some clout because they have numbers and a bit of organization, and because they can all scrape together enough money to call in a big gun if they really truly need it.  They probably won’t last.  Someone nasty will step in and take over what they’re trying to build and it’s probably going to be ugly.  The only reason they’ve lasted this long is that the rest of us have bigger fish to fry.  They’re still a few rungs up the totem pole above you, mind you.”“It’s too hard so it’s not worth trying?”“Go home, Vicky,” she said, almost sighing the words.  “Go back, figure out your family thing, keep trying to sign on to one of the big hero teams, you’re bound to find a position somewhere eventually.  Some cape will die in battle, and a seat will open up for you and you’ll do fine.  Or retire.  After what your sister did to you, nobody would blame you.”I closed my eyes.“Do what any self-respecting twenty-one year old would do after failing to get into university, get a job waitressing or making hero sandwiches.  Talk to your kids about the old Glory days.”I opened my eyes.  “And what happens to Cedar Point, in this hypothetical?”“I’m talking reality, Vicky.  It’s going to be the same thing that was going to happen before the villains turned up, and it’s the same thing that’s going to happen when and if you try and summarily fail to change things there.  The area struggles, it withers, it becomes irrelevant.  This isn’t your fight, and it’s not what you’re equipped to do.  You hit things.  You can take a bullet, unless you’re doing something peculiar like keeping your forcefield down while standing between a man with a gun and Snuff here.”“Heya,” Snuff said, raising a hand.I didn’t move a muscle, didn’t react.  Tattletale smiled.“I know what you’re doing with your forcefield, Vicky.  Just like I did back then.  I know why you’re doing it, too.  I know you don’t belong in Cedar Point, and I know you’re just going to cause headaches for me and the actual heroes if you try anything.  It’s not your skillset, it’s not your powerset.”I still had the paper in my hand.  I tapped it against my upper arm, my arms still folded.  “Four years, and you haven’t changed a bit since you raided that bank.”“When we robbed that bank, I was doing multiple things all at once, laying groundwork for moves I wouldn’t make for weeks and months.  If I haven’t changed from that, I think I’m doing okay,” she said.“Are you, though?” I asked.  “Your hair is messy, and you look tired.”“I’m going to pretend you’re actually asking out of a concern for my well being, because if I didn’t pretend, I’d walk away, and I might even give some free-of-charge advice to those Hollow Point ruffians, telling them how to beat you if they run into you.”“Entirely out of concern for your well being,” I said, with as little warmth and concern in my voice as I could muster.  “Hometown respect, you know.”“I’m one of the major players now.  The other major players call me for a hint when they’re stuck on something.  I’m wealthy, well-positioned, and safe.  I’m now sharing the love and bringing some of that security, stability, and safety to others, in my very, very roundabout way.  It’s part of why I’m having this conversation with you.”“Sure,” I said.  I paused.  “Speaking of you showing up, I’m surprised the rest of your old team didn’t turn up too, for old time or camaraderie’s sake.”She turned.  With the way the light came through the tunnel, I could see the eye symbol on her chest in a slightly different shade of purple, hidden where the vertical bar met the horizontal, and the shadows meant I could no longer see her eyes or expression.   Maintaining the same tone, she said, “No, you’re not surprised.  You know full well they’re well positioned too.  They’re doing their own things.  They’re still a resource I can and will tap.”“Gotcha,” I said.“But I think you were trying to get a jab in, and that’s a good sign this conversation has run its course.  I’ll wish you good luck in your endeavors, whether you join a big team or end up making those sandwiches.  So long as you stay out of my way.”“Out of curiosity,” I said.  I saw her pause, just as she was about to turn to walk away.  I continued, “Do you regret your part in what happened with my sister?”“Do you?” she asked, without missing a beat.“Absolutely,” I said, without any more hesitation than she’d shown.“Be sure to call before you set foot in my neighborhood again.  You and your friend have a nice flight home.”Friend?  My first thought was that she meant my autonomous forcefield, that she was personifying it.Then I realized who she really meant.  Just as surprising that she would be aware, but not as alarming.She hadn’t answered my question, but I hadn’t expected an answer.  She and Snuff walked to the parking lot, turning the corner there.  Behind me, the gunman was walking back to his table.My impression was that I was better off heading the way I’d come than I was leaving.The moment I didn’t have the roof of the tunnel over my head, I took to the air.I was high enough that I could see the entirety of Tattletale’s realm, and where the city was bleeding into and through the mountains and forest to connect to other areas and the remainder of the megalopolis.  I could see the boats on the water, like ants on an anthill, the black smoke, and the patches that gleamed with a forced luster.It wasn’t home.  The worst of the fucking racists were gone, I had to hope, but the rest of the bad stuff seemed to be firmly entrenched in there.I drew my phone from my pocket.  I put the one earbud in, some music to drown out my thoughts while I steadied myself.Me:



Did you record all of that?A dark shape flew within a foot of me.  For an instant, I thought it might have been one of the small birds that had arrived with Tattletale.It was a sphere, consisting of several layers like an onion, alternating blue and red.  The lens was a white circle, and as it roved, the layers moved to accommodate it looking around.  Several fins extended out from the two most external layers, moving independently of one another to correct its position and hold eerily steady in the wind.“Recorded it all,” the camera said, Kenzie’s voice with some synthesizer mixing things up.“You got the sound, too?”“Of course,” she said.  “Can I listen to it?”“No,” I said.  “Not yet.  Not when Tattletale operates the way she does.  I’ve got a long flight back.  Any way you can replay the conversation for me so I can listen to it on the way back, and figure out if anything needs redacting?”“Without listening in?”“I’d prefer if you listened in with the rest of the group.  I’m concerned Tattletale can say something to me that affects one of you.  She touched on some personal subjects, and I need to think about how much I’m comfortable sharing.”“Not a problem.  Give me a minute.”I started my flight home, the camera flying alongside me.I expected the camera to speak, when Kenzie was ready.  I was a little surprised when it came through my ear-bud instead.⊙“…you’re bound to find a position somewhere eventually.  Some cape will die in battle, and a seat will open up for you and you’ll do fine.  Or retire.  After what your sister did to you, nobody would blame you.”I was still, listening to this.  The others, Rain excepted, were gathered around the table.  The library had picnic tables and benches strewn around, and some patio chairs for reading outdoors when the weather was good. They had arranged themselves on a mixture of seats, with Ashley standing.  Kenzie’s laptop was sitting on a patio table, with Rain watching in through a halting, low-res webcam.I’d been periodically pausing the conversation, to fill in gaps with basic knowledge and context, but I left things alone for this one.“Do what any self-respecting twenty-one year old would do after failing to get into university, get a job waitressing or making hero sandwiches.  Talk to your kids about the old Glory days.”“Pause,” I said.The recording paused.“It took her a little while to get around to it, but it’s worth stressing that this is who she is.  I thought about redacting these parts, but I think it’s important you know.  The PRT thought she had the ability to sense weak points, primarily psychological ones.  I agree with that assessment.”“Your sister is Panacea, right?” Chris asked.I tensed a bit.“Chris,” Sveta said.  “I think Victoria would prefer it if we glossed over that part.”“It’s for context.  Like she just said, it stresses who Tattletale is.”“She was a healer,” I said.  “Tattletale’s words caught her in a bad way at a bad time.  Two months later, she had a mental breakdown.  In part because of what Tattletale said.  She put me in the hospital.  Let’s leave it at that.”“Resume recording,” Kenzie said.“And what happens to Cedar Point, in this hypothetical?”“I’m talking reality, Vicky.  It’s going to be the same thing that was going to happen before the villains turned up, and it’s the same thing that’s going to happen when and if you try and summarily fail to change things there.”“Pause,” I said.  “She likes to act like she knows what’s going to happen, but it’s worth saying she can be surprised.  She was surprised at the bank.  She and her team pulled it off regardless, but… she was surprised by my arrival, and by my sister being there.”“Worth keeping in mind,” Tristan said.  “If we wind up fighting her.”“I’m giving you all the info I can, so you can make an informed decision,” I said.  “Resume.”“-The area struggles, it withers, it becomes irrelevant.  This isn’t your fight, and it’s not what you’re equipped to do.  You hit things.  You-”Kenzie’s voice chimed in with a cheerful, synthesized, “Redacted!”“Pause.  Redacted because it’s a weak point,” I said.  “Power-related.”“I think I know,” Sveta said.  “If this makes you doubt Victoria at all, I hope me vouching for her helps.”“It helps,” Kenzie said.  “Not that I was doubting her.”“Resume,” I said.“-I know you don’t belong in Cedar Point, and I know you’re just going to cause headaches for me and the actual heroes if you try anything.  It’s not your skillset, it’s not your powerset.”There was a small chime as a message appeared in the corner of the laptop.  The recording paused in response to the message appearing.Rain:  Is it ours?“That’s a conversation I want to have shortly,” I said.  “Powers.”“I’m looking forward to this,” Chris said.Behind him, pacing a little, Ashley smiled.Right.“Resume,” I said.“Redacted, redacted,” Kenzie’s synthesized voice played.  Then Tattletale’s voice came up again.  “I’m one of the major players now.  The other major players call me for a hint when they’re stuck on something.  I’m wealthy, well-positioned, and safe.  I’m now sharing the love and bringing some of that security, stability, and safety to others, in my very, very roundabout way.  It’s part of why I’m having this conversation with you.”“Stop,” I said.  The recording paused, and Kenzie hit a keyboard shortcut to close the window.  “Everything that followed was small talk, some threats from her, and stuff about my sister I don’t want to get into.  That’s Tattletale.  That’s how she sees the world.  I do believe her when she says there’s no good way to break into this scene.  There are a lot of people who want to hold their positions and the power they’ve taken for themselves, and when you’ve cornered them, they’re going to call people like Tattletale for backup.”“Or worse,” Ashley said.  That was apparently what she’d fixated on, during the earlier part of the conversation.“Or worse.  People who are good at the roles they’ve taken on, well-proven by years of experience, people who can and will casually destroy you.”“No matter what we do,” Sveta said, “We’re going to run into trouble.  So we do nothing or we plan for it.”“We plan for it,” Tristan said.  “Ashley and I were talking about this.  Something that might fit our niche, and gives key members of our team what they’re looking for.”He looked at Kenzie as he said the last bit, and Kenzie visibly perked up.“You have a game plan?” I asked.“The start of one,” Tristan said.  “Maybe.”I thought about that for a moment.  The others exchanged a few words, and a chime signaled Rain’s comment for the convo – he and Tristan had apparently exchanged some messages about the plan.“Did you guys bring costume stuff?” I asked, when there was an opening.  “Those of you that have it?”That got me confirmation from about half of the group.“I have spare, basic masks for those that need them,” I said.  “I also have the start of my team outline written up on my laptop.  What do you guys say we move to an area with some elbow room, you can show me enough of your powers that I know what to put in the document, and we talk about what you’ve got in mind?”It might as well have been a rhetorical question.  None of them were about to say no to that.                                                                                           Glare – 3.2                                                                                           “Hey, Victoria, you’re strong right?” Kenzie asked.“Kind of,” I said.  “I’d be worried about breaking whatever it is I’m handling.”“It’s pretty durable.”I thought about my forcefield.  “I totaled the last car I lifted.”“I brought things, and I thought maybe Chris could lift some or Tristan could, but Tristan doesn’t think he’s strong enough and Chris doesn’t want to.”She turned stick out her tongue at Chris.“Limited duration,” Chris said.“I can take a look, where is this?” I asked Kenzie.“At the street.  Black van.  I’ll show you.”“Yeah, that’d help.  I’ll probably have questions.”I turned to the others, pointing at the treeline.  “If you guys want to head over that way, stop at the rocky outcropping on the hill.  We’ll meet you there.”Kenzie walked with me.  She was wearing black overalls and a pink tank top, a red apple clip in her hair, and red sneakers.  Her hair was in much the same style as before, but the buns were set higher.I paid more attention to her fashion choice because so much about it seemed deliberate, from color scheme to running theme.  During the last meeting it had been a star on her dress, partially on her shirt, and in her hair.“My dad gave me a ride today, because he needs to buy a suit and more work clothes,” Kenzie said.  “Please don’t judge me too harshly if he acts really lame.”“I won’t,” I said.  “You said Tristan and Chris could have helped.  Tristan has increased strength?”“Just a little.  Very very little.”“I guess we’ll find out soon.”“Sveta could have helped too, we think, she’s really strong if she uses her real body, but it would have meant dragging it and that would have hurt the grass.”“How big is this thing?”“I’ll show you,” she said.  She sprinted the last little way to the sleek van that was parked on the street in front of the library, hopping up to the passenger side window, clinging to the bottom edge of the open window so she could stick her head in.  The back door of the van popped open, and Kenzie’s father stepped out, walking around the van to the sidewalk.He was almost as meticulous in appearance as Kenzie.  He was very lean, with pronounced cheekbones and a long face that was made to look longer by the goatee that extended an inch from his chin.  He wore a short-sleeved work shirt with a pinstripe pattern on it, and slim jeans that looked like they had cost a pretty penny.  Shoes, belt, and watch, all expensive-looking.The beard and his longer hair weren’t as tidy as Kenzie was, but I was hardly about to judge, given how it was probably a day off for him and he was sitting in the sun.“Dad, this is Victoria.  She’s the coach I was talking about.  Victoria, this is my dad.”“Hi, Mr…”  I extended a hand.“Julien Martin,” he said.  He shook my hand.  Both handshake and his tone were stiff, but it was a different kind of stiffness than I was used to seeing in Dean’s family.  I was well aware of how easily I’d slotted him onto that same mental shelf.“You can call him Julien,” Kenzie said.“Nice to meet you.  What do you do?”“Realty.”“Dad only got into realty a year and a half ago, but he’s really good at both the buying and selling sides of things.  I don’t really get it all, but his boss seemed pretty happy with him.  You got a promotion, right?”“I did.”“He’s doing it ethically, too, which is so important, with so many shady people out there.”“I’m trying,” he said.“I can respect that,” I said.  “Thanks for bringing Kenzie out this far, and for bringing her stuff.”Kenzie rolled her eyes.  “We should go take a look so we don’t keep the others waiting.”Julien followed us around to the back of the van, standing back while we opened the doors.  A black box that was a bit larger than a washing machine was sitting in there, strapped down ten ways from Sunday, to keep it from sliding around when the vehicle moved.  More boxes were sitting at either side of the van, with straps to keep them flush against the wall, but they weren’t any larger than a backpack or suitcase.“We got the van because some of my stuff is hard to move,” Kenzie said.“Okay,” I said.  The box had a metal frame around the edges, with a crossbar running diagonally along each face.  “What do I need to know?”“Pick it up and move it.”“It’s tinkertech, right?”“It is.”“Is there a chance of a misfire if it’s moved in the wrong way, if something’s crushed or broken?”“No.”“Will I hurt anything if it’s turned on its side?”“No,” Kenzie said.  “Hm.  It’s best if you don’t turn it upside down.”“Where should I grab it, to best carry it?”“Geeez,” Kenzie said.  “It’s not going to blow up or anything.  Or if it did, it wouldn’t be a big enough explosion to hurt anyone.  Not unless very specific conditions were met.”“Right,” I said.  I had an issue with my power, where I wasn’t sure I trusted the forcefield to simply hold the box and not crush or dig into it.  It was only about a minute of flying to get to where I wanted to go, but even if everything went according to plan, I was worried that handling the box for more than a couple of seconds would leave handprints or gouges in it.While I investigated, Kenzie climbed in beside me, peering at the box and watching me.“Give me some space?” I asked.Kenzie grabbed some smaller things on her way out.It took a few minutes, but I unclipped the straps that were securing the box in place, and laid them across the ground.  I lifted the box, and set it down on the straps.  I connected them, wrapping them around the box, then slid it around so I could reach the ones at the back.  There was a ramp built into the truck, and I could see where the box could slide along the tracks, but it seemed like more of a hassle to use the ramp and unload that way.“How dangerous is this team business going to be?” Julien asked, behind me.“Dad,” Kenzie protested.  “Don’t embarrass me.”“If I thought it was going to be a serious danger, I wouldn’t be helping,” I said, still working on the straps.  “But I can’t guarantee anything.”I fastened the straps, then hauled the entire thing out, forcefield up, gripping the box.  It thudded against the street.  Dense.“Is it a problem?” I asked Julien.“It’s not a problem,” Kenzie said, firm.  “I can handle myself.  I’ve trained more than a lot of heroes, because I did a year going to all the practice events and stuff.”“I’m more interested in what your dad has to say.  I don’t want to step on toes, and your parents get the last word.”“It’s fine,” Julien said.  “If it wasn’t this, she would be doing something else.  I prefer this team idea.”“You should,” Kenzie huffed.“Do you need to be picked up?”“Yes, please.  In…?” Kenzie looked at me.“Two hours?” I asked.  “Is that okay?”“It’s fine,” her dad said.  He still had that tone, which came across curt, inflexible.  I had a hard time imagining him as a salesman.  Accountant, maybe.“Before you do anything, can you go to the train station?  Rain had to take the train and he’s running late.  Bring him here?” Kenzie asked.Her dad frowned.“Please,” Kenzie said.“Where am I going?” he asked.“Give me your phone, I’ll put it in there.”While they fussed, I checked and fixed the remainder of the straps.“I’ll be right back,” I said.The straps served to let me hold the box without actually holding it.  I flew, holding the length of straps that I’d wound together and attached at the tail end.  The box made for unwieldy flying, swinging below me.Could the forcefield potentially claw through them?  Yes.  I hoped I’d be able to see it before it managed to succeed.I flew in the direction I’d sent the others, leaving Kenzie behind.My phantom self gripped the length of straps, scratched, squeezed, and twisted it, periodically making the ten foot length of cords bend in unusual shapes.I hadn’t interacted with it much.  I hadn’t seen the limits of its intelligence or lack thereof.  This one minute of flying might have even been the longest period I’d properly used my strength in two years.I sighted the others, sitting on the rocks and talking.  I dropped low, and I set the box down on the ground.  Even with the care I was taking, it made a noise on landing.“Wow,” Tristan said.  “How heavy is that thing?”“No idea,” I said.  “If I had to guess, maybe three hundred and fifty pounds?”“I can see why she has a hard time moving those things around.”“She described them as being bigger,” Chris said.  “Others, I think.  I think they start at that size and get larger.”“Did her dad leave?” Sveta asked.“Not yet,” I said.  “They’re figuring out logistics.  He’s going to go pick up Rain at the station.  Be right back.”I flew over to where Kenzie and her dad were.  Kenzie’s dad was in the driver’s seat, and Kenzie was closing the rear doors.  A series of bags and boxes were unloaded, all packed together.As I landed, her dad pulled away.  Kenzie raised a hand in a wave.I was aware of the lack of a wave in response.  From the way she lowered her hand and glanced at me, Kenzie was too.“Want to fly over?” I asked.Her eyes lit up with excitement as she nodded.There were very few people in the world who didn’t like flying.It was, in a way, almost as much of a pain to bring Kenzie, two cases and two boxes without my strength active, as it had been to move the one cube.  I ended up lifting her by the straps at the back of her overalls, my hand also wrapped around the strap of one bag, while Kenzie held other things.We arrived at the hill with the rocks.  There was light overgrowth, a fairly loose distribution of trees for the fact that it was untamed wilderness, and thick grass.  A surveying team had passed through at one point, and they had disturbed earth here and there, felled a few trees, and spray painted the face of one of the larger rocks before leaving.A bit of a shame, but I could understand the need for a quick and easy label.  No minerals or stone of any particular value here.Chris, wearing his headphones again, was wearing what looked like the same shorts as he had worn at the meeting, and a different t-shirt.  He was examining the box, while keeping at least two feet away from it at all times.  He had a bag with him, a travelers’ backpack that was packed full, but he’d put it down.“You don’t have to keep your distance,” Kenzie said.  “It’s not dangerous.”“It’s tinkertech.  It’s science that gets at least some of its functionality from interdimensional fuckery, built by cooperation between you and the unfathomable, menacing thing that chose you as its host.”“It’s a camera, Chris.  It records and projects.”“It’s a camera built with collaboration between you and a unknowable, violence-driven multiversal horror.”“My multiversal horror is pretty tame, I think.  She just likes to build things and gather information,”  Kenzie pressed buttons on the side of the box.  A triangle between reinforcing bars lit up.A hologram appeared a number of feet away.  A potbellied rat with a crooked nose.“…And you’re using it to make cartoons,” Chris said.“Plump Rat King,” Sveta said.  “Some of the kids at the hospital liked that one.”“It’s okay,” Kenzie said.  “Only the first season was really any good.”“What’s it good for?” Ashley asked.  She was taking things a step further than Chris’ wearing of the same shorts.  She wore the same dress she had worn at the meeting, the damage at the corner mended imperfectly.  One of the straps, I realized, had been damaged and patched, but her hair masked much of it.  She had a black mask in her hand, but she hadn’t put it on.“Stuff.  Loads of stuff.  I’ll show you some later,” Kenzie said.  She started opening boxes.Tristan, much like Kenzie, was unpacking a bag.  His costume was armor.  It struck a balance between function and appearance, but it looked like it was a pretty good quality.  Each segment was framed with goat’s heads and horns, spirals and ridges.  Where it wasn’t brushed metal, things were painted or tinted red or light red.  He saw me looking and smiled.“Byron is the fish theme, then?” I asked.“Water as much as fish.  Yeah,” Tristan said.“You have some kind of superstrength, right?”“A very small amount.  Helps when you’re wearing armor as heavy as this, or when you’re using a power that can make heavy things.”“Seems like a good place to get us started,” I said.Tristan turned around, seating himself firmly on the sloped ground, his armor partially unpacked and arranged beside him.  Some bits were already fastened into place on his arms and legs, over a bodysuit that seemed designed to go between him and his armor.He held up his hand, and produced three motes of orange-red light.  As each one moved through the air, it left a trail behind it, like the afterimage of a sparkler waved through the darkness.  They traced a circle and as the moving points of light connected to the end of each trail, a shape came to life.  A discus, with a slight peak on one side.I extended a hand, and he passed it to me.Dense, heavy, very solid.  Matter creation.“You can throw it,” he said.I threw it.  It wasn’t as aerodynamic as a frisbee, but it did catch the air.  It wobbled mid-flight and veered off course, crashing into a tree before disappearing into a patch of grass.Tristan was already making something else.  Twelve or more motes of light traced the shape.  “Requires a bit of concentration, I can rush it or force it to come into being early, but you get weirdness like… this.”It materialized.  A hammer or a mace, long-handled.  The weirdness was in how the shape finalized its form, drawing pretty creative curves and hooks.  Spikes, horns, thorns, and other slightly curved growths stood out.  It looked unbalanced.“Are they permanent?” I asked.“They can be.  Depends if I keep the sparks alive or not.  I can create a lot of sparks, but it requires more time, more concentration.”“What’s the difference between keeping it alive or not?” I asked.“Ah,” he said.  He pushed himself to his feet, shifting his footing to make sure he wouldn’t slide down the hill.  He held out the mace, and started to form the motes for another.  He rushed this one even more than he had the last.  The shape was more unwieldy, less balanced.  “Byron, you want to help with demonstrations today, or do you want to be left alone?”Tristan blurred, features distorting, his eyes flaring with the same light as the sparks had.  The light turned blue, and then he was Byron, wearing a hooded sweatshirt and jeans.One of the two maces exploded into a spray of water.  Sveta made a noise of surprise, and Chris, still mostly fixated on examining Kenzie’s cube, jumped back from the cube in surprise.Byron turned his head so the backspray hit him in the side of the face, rather than right in the center of it.  He dropped the still-intact mace he held with his other hand.“Hi Byron,” Kenzie said.“Hi,” I added my greeting to Kenzie’s.  “We haven’t formally met.”“We haven’t.  I got the basics,” he said.“So I gathered.”“This is a terrible idea,” he said.  “Tristan being involved, this team concept, the potential for disaster, and this thing with Tattletale?”“I don’t see anyone changing their mind.  Mrs. Yamada couldn’t convince them, I don’t think I can.  If they’re going to do this or something like this, isn’t it better that they do it smart and informed?”“I don’t know,” he said.  “But if you’re enabling them, you should know you own a share of what happens.”“I don’t think that’s fair,” Sveta said.“It might be fair,” I said.“My voice doesn’t matter either.  I tried, nobody listens.  Maybe I own a bit of what happens for not trying harder to stop Tristan from going forward with this.”“You sound pretty certain something bad is going to happen.”“I was there for all the therapy sessions, even if I didn’t participate,” he said.  He looked at the others.  “Don’t worry, I’m not going to say anything.  But I am going to say, again, this is a trainwreck waiting to happen.”“We got it,” Chris said.  “Saying it over and over doesn’t change anything.”“Be kind, Chris,” Sveta said.  “There’s a lot playing into Byron’s concerns.”Byron shook his head.  He glanced at me.“You need anything, while we’re talking?” I asked.He shook his head.  “No.  Um.  You seem alright, so… be safe.  Be wary.  And for the record, since you’re going to ask…”He showed me his power.  Motes of light, like Tristan’s, blue.  He drew them in the air, two expanding, abstract shapes, not closed like Tristan’s had been.  He positioned them so there was one on either side of him, then clenched his fist.  The lines that were drawn became water, buckets worth, spraying out in the direction the lines had been drawn.  He had drawn them out as expanding spirals, and the resulting water flew out in circular sprays.“You can use me if you need to clean up, Tristan,” Byron said.  “I’ll do the quick swaps if you need them.”The water was still spraying when Byron blurred, features distorting and smearing together, the two lighted eyes peering through the shadows between folds and smears, going from blue to orange-red.One of the sprays of water lost all of its oomph, the remaining water striking the ground to flow through grass and between rocks.  The other diagram became a solid object, a wheel spikier and cruder than what Tristan had made.  It hit the ground and stuck there.The water that Byron’s power had produced rained down on us for several seconds.“It’s not going to hurt the box?” Chris asked.“Nope,” Kenzie said.  “Waterproofed just in case Byron visited.  It was good to see you, Byron, by the way.  I hope to prove you wrong.”“Yeah,” Sveta said.  “That’s a good way of putting it, Kenzie.”Tristan’s face was at an angle that saw him looking down at the ground.  At first I thought he was trying to keep the water out of his face.  Then, as he changed the angle of his head a little, I saw his face.“For the record,” Tristan said, “If it’s my two hours and I ask you a question and then pass the baton, I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t take up extra time and use it to try and sabotage me.”“I did say hi to him,” I said.Tristan shrugged.  “He didn’t have to say all that.  He’s quick to say there’s a problem but he doesn’t suggest alternatives.  He whines about the circumstances but he won’t attend the therapy and he doesn’t want to work on figuring out better courses of action.  It pisses me off sometimes, especially when he elbows into my time to make what I’m trying to accomplish harder.”His tone was hard.  Pissed off seemed like an apt description.  I’d seen Tristan, casual and smiling some before he’d changed, and now this felt like a complete, sudden shift.It was easy to forget that he was in there while Byron was out here, feeling things, thinking, his mood changing during that short conversation.I could see the expressions of others.  The sympathy on Sveta’s face, the tilt of Chris’ head.Ashley looked especially focused and attentive, her pacing around the hill having come to a stop.  One of her hands was at her hair, pushing it back out of her face, the water helping it stay there.“It seems like hard feelings are inevitable,” I said.“Yeah,” Tristan said.  He looked away.  “I can keep my shapes ‘alive’.  If they’re still alive when I change, they become water.  If they aren’t, they’re there to stay.  Same for Byron’s water.  It’s effective if he makes water, sloshes it over someone, and then changes, to make it solid.  We’ve tagged a good dozen villains that way.”“A dozen is a really good number for a teenage hero.”“Yeah,” Tristan said.“You’re pretty lucky, getting a name that fitting for a power like that.”“Constellations forming rock and water?” Tristan asked.  He snorted air through his nostrils.  “Want to know the hilarious thing?”“I do,” I said.  I wasn’t sure whatever he was going to say was ‘hilarious’, given his tone, but I’d hoped today would be a lighter endeavor, and any humor would help.“We weren’t even rock and water, originally.  Reach bought the name from the last Capricorn.  She got wounded in battle and she retired.  Win-win.  We got settled into the role, got our name, our armor, our brand, and… power changed to match.”“That’s really interesting,” I said.  “There’s a lot of potential there.”“There is.  Absolutely.  And not all of it’s good,” Tristan said.“But some of it is,” Sveta said.“Some of it is, yeah,” Tristan said.  He offered her a small smile.I could see the concerted effort he was making to pull out of the funk.  A few words from his brother and he was upset enough that it showed in his tone and the direction of what he was talking about.Tricky, that kind of negativity sitting just under the surface.“Sveta,” I said.  Change of topic.  “I’m guessing you’ve worked on control enough that you feel okay letting loose in limited ways?”“Kind of,” she said.  “I don’t want to go all-out in a combat situation.  I don’t want to do anything that would risk people getting hurt.”“Okay,” I said.“I figured I would mostly stay in the suit.  I can do this…”She didn’t touch or move anything external, but the joints of her elbow shifted, and the forearm and hand dropped.  Ten or so tendrils extended between elbow and forearm, like a muscle with gaps between strands.She moved it, tendrils bending, flinging her hand and the attached segment of arm out fifty feet.  She tried to grab a branch, missed it, grabbed another, and seized it, before pulling her body to follow.  I saw her turn her head away as she pulled herself through the intervening twigs and leaves.She twisted around, pointed a hand, and used tendrils to push her fist out.She seized the wheel that Byron had left embedded in the earth, and pulled herself to it.There was a bit of gracelessness to the landing, her pants leg and the side of her body rubbing against the grass, a few clumps of earth flying, but it served to put her in our midst again.  She wobbled as she stood and Tristan and I caught her between us.She made a small ‘phew’ sound.“You’re made of grappling hooks, basically,” Chris said.  Kenzie, sitting on her box, stuck out her toe to jab Chris in the shoulder.“I can get things for my body.  Weld and I were talking about getting a second body for cape things.  If I had hooks I could unfold I could more reliably grab things.  And I’ll get better with practice,” Sveta said.  “And I really want extra shielding for my joints because they’re the easiest part to break, and I don’t want to have to send it out to be repaired and be unable to walk or do things in the meantime.”“What happens if the suit gets broken?” I asked.  “As in broken enough that it doesn’t keep you contained?”“Um.  I have a collapsed hamster ball in here.  I can spit it out, unfold it, shove myself in there and bring the lid behind me.  It’s a bit cramped, it’s not the biggest, and it might not always work, but I’ve also been working hard at keeping myself under control.”I suppressed a wince.  Sveta had worked hard for as long as I’d known her, and I knew that the anxiety was tied into the lack of control in a feedback loop, and that her being so much more confident and happy would mean she had more control, but all it took was one bad incident.“Workable,” I said.  “We’d have to be really, really careful.”“Absolutely,” she said, with dead seriousness.  “The way I see it, my body is pretty hardy.  To break containment, it would take something that would maim an ordinary person.”“Yeah,” I said.  But if they think you’re durable, they might not hold back.We’d address that when it came to it.“Alright,” I said.  “So, my line of thinking was that instead of explaining, we’d do a little bit of a team exercise.”I heard a faint groan from Chris.“It should be fun, and it should be relatively low-key,” I said.  “We split everyone into teams of three, and we play a small game of capture the flag, here.”“See, that’s playing dirty,” Tristan said.  “You’re playing into my love for competition, here.”“It’s fun,” Kenzie said.  “I really like this.”It seemed Kenzie could be counted on to be positive.  I said, “I’m hoping it’s fun.  Does anyone else need to explain their powers or cover anything before we get into it?  I know what Ashley can do, unless something’s changed.”Ashley shook her head.“We’ll see you in action when we have our competition, then.  That leaves Chris and Kenzie, kind of.”“I’ve got some things,” Kenzie said.  She opened a case.  “Two of these things I had as just-in-case things when I was a Ward.  I got them fixed up recently, and I even made an improvement.  Eye hook-”She pulled out a coil of metal.  She stuck it on the corner of her cube, then held her phone in one hand, moving her thumb around.  The coil unfurled, prehensile, and its tip unfolded from its teardrop shape.  Three claws, extending from around a circular lens with a pupil.  Kenzie moved her head and body in time with the movements of the thing.The thing moved closer to me, until it was two feet from my face, the three claw-blades opening and closing a little.  It blinked at me, shutter closing momentarily.“It was made to look through vents, to start with.  it’s delicate enough it can turn screws and drill holes, and I can swap out the lens for others.  And I’ve got this flash gun too.”She held up something that looked like a child’s toy, squat, blunt, with a lens on the front.“It’s for when I had to get closer to the scene when I was with the Baltimore Wards.  They wanted me to be able to protect myself and they wanted nonlethal.”“What does it do?” I asked.“Makes light,” she said.  She aimed it off to the side and pulled the trigger.It looked and sounded like a camera flash going off.“And the other stuff?”“Mask with a few settings,” Kenzie said.  She pulled out a high-tech mask, metal around the edges to give a general circular shape to the clear pane for her face, but she didn’t put it on.  She held up a disc, then clipped it to the front of her overalls, so it was directly over the pocket at her chest.  “This is kind of a costume thing I haven’t finalized.”“Good,” I said.  “Great.”“I transform,” Chris said.  “Changer.”I made a motion for him to continue.He sounded aggrieved, like it was my fault he had to explain at all, “I don’t know what else you want.  I have a few different forms.  They’re inspired by my moods and mental states.”“You give them names based on what mood or state they’re from,” Kenzie said.  “Like Creeping Anxiety and Wistful Distraction.”“Yeah,” Chris said.  “Look, the rest of you know.  Explain.  I’m going to go change.”He grabbed his bag and hefted it over one shoulder, then began trudging uphill.“These forms reflect the feelings?” I asked.“Very much so,” Sveta said.“It sounds like he has more than a few forms,” I said.“Eight or more, as far as I’ve counted,” Kenzie said.  “He said a few, but I think he loses track.  There’s wiggle room in each form, too.  It depends on a lot of factors.  Diet, time since he last used a form, if he pushes for something in the middle.”“He’s strong,” Ashley said.“He might be,” Tristan said.Kenzie continued to volunteer information.  “The forms tend to come with pretty heavy weakness.  Anxiety is quick but fragile.  That sort of thing.”“I think I get it,” I said.  “Can I ask why he’s in the group?”“The drawbacks,” Tristan said.“The fragility isn’t a drawback?” I asked.“It’s one.  He doesn’t change all the way back.”“What?” I asked.Tristan explained, “He changes to one, he gets a little taller, a little stronger, a little more sluggish.  He changes to another, gets better eyes, ears…”“Thus the headphones,” Kenzie said.“…and less responsive in hand-eye coordination to go with it.  He tries to balance, but lately it’s been getting worse.”“What happens if he doesn’t change?”“The body stays the same,” Sveta said.  “He doesn’t change physically.”“Which is good.”“But he doesn’t change mentally either.  He says he can’t tap those emotions he’s not using, he can’t think as clearly, his thoughts go in circles.”“Lose-lose,” I said.“Something like that,” Ashley said.I could hear Chris’ approach, now.  The sound of branches breaking underfoot, the rustling of under- and over-growth.He’d grown.  He’d shucked off his clothes and he’d donned what looked like an oversized pair of shorts in a coarse cloth.  They had to have taken up most of the bag’s space.  He was twelve feet tall, with skewed proportions.  Large legs, large around the middle, large hands, all with coarse hair.  His shoulders seemed somewhat narrow, his neck long, his head only a little larger than normal, with faintly pronounced tusks.  His hair, wild before, was just a bit longer than it had been.“He chose one of the more pleasant looking forms,” Kenzie said, cheerful.  She grabbed her stuff.How in the fuck was I supposed to make someone like Chris marketable?  How was I supposed to wrangle Ashley or handle Tristan’s issue?“Twenty minutes,” Tristan said.  “Then he changes back.  We should hurry.”Capture the flag.  Right.  A part of me wished I hadn’t brought it up.  I could have left things at this, with powers explained and demonstrated in brief, and then I could have taken a few days to think.I needed a few days to think, so feelings wouldn’t be hurt, damage wouldn’t be done.I didn’t have it.  I’d lose too much stock with these guys if I changed my mind.  Chris and Ashley especially.“Who wants to be team leaders?” I asked.Tristan raised one hand.  Ashley raised another.“Ashley, you want to pick first?” I asked.“Kenzie.”“Woo!” Kenzie cheered.“Sveta,” Tristan said.  “You’d be my second pick, after Rain.  Weld fan club.”“Chris,” Ashley said.  She pulled on her mask.  It was v-shaped, covering the nose, ears, and eyes, leaving just a hint of her eyebrows visible above.“You guys set up over there, opposite side of the hill, then,” I said.  Ashley and the two youngest members of the team.“You’re filling in for Rain?” Tristan asked me.“Yeah,” I said.  “I’m mostly interested in seeing how you guys operate, so I’ll mostly stick to playing defense and keeping an eye on things.”“Alright.  I don’t think that’ll be a problem,” he said.I wasn’t so sure.  I could see the way he set his jaw, before he pulled his horned helmet on.  I had an idea of his disposition already.  I could see the look of Ashley’s eyes behind her mask, too.  She wanted to be leader, by the looks of things, and that meant she had something to prove.  I saw Chris as the giant, properly smiling for the first time since I’d met him, as he looked back over one shoulder, lumbering away.  It made me more concerned, rather than less.Sveta took my hand, squeezing it.  Off to the side, Tristan was drawing something out of motes of light, ten feet tall and twenty feet wide.  A wall.I’d wanted to test them, to see how they functioned as discrete units, and possibly to highlight difficulties.The more I saw, the less sure I was that these guys were equipped to handle even a friendly contest.  There were so many messy parts to this.  Above all else, the ones with the power seemed least suited to wield it.“Believe in us,” Sveta said, her voice soft.I wanted to.  I really did.“I think,” I said, and I said it to Tristan, “You should take this opportunity to explain your game plan.”                                                                                           Glare – 3.3                                                                                           “You want a game plan?” Tristan said.  “Do you mean for here or for the big picture?”I was thinking big picture, I thought, I have doubts right now and a plan would help.Without voicing that, I said, “Here, but I’m open to hearing about either.  If you have something in mind.”“I want to wait on the big picture stuff so we can include Rain into the discussion.  He and I chat regularly, and he’s heard some, but Ashley and I were talking while we waited for you and there’s bits to discuss.  Comfort levels.”“Okay,” I said.  “We’ll focus on this for now.”“I’m in charge, then?” Tristan asked.“If Sveta is okay with it, you can give it a shot.”“I’m okay with it,” Sveta said.He made a small amused sound, his face obscured by his helmet, his hands busy adjusting the fit of his armor as he paced.  “There was a time I thought I might end up being in charge of Reach.  Things fell through before then.  I don’t know if my current mindset works for it, but let’s give this a try.”I had my own bag, which I’d brought with me.  My computer, masks, and the flags, one red and one blue.  I fished out the flags, holding both in one hand, and put on one of the masks.“Victoria, you and I are on defense, then,” he said.  “Ashley is going to go hard offense, that’s who she is, and I don’t see Chris holding back.  Sveta, you’re going on the attack.  You loop around, go the long way if you have to.  You might have to dodge Kenzie, but I think you can manage that okay.  It’s only her hook thing and flash gun.”“Sounds like a plan,” Sveta said.“Alright,” I said.“I think the benefit here is that we all have some experience,” he said.“Kind of,” Sveta said.“They’re young.  Ashley too, in a weird way.  They’re led by Ashley and we know how she thinks.  I can put my confidence in you, Sveta, if you’re going for their flag.”“I hope I deserve it.”“I’m confident in myself and my ability to hold up against a two-person rush, assuming that’s what they do, and I know you’ve got a background, Victoria.”“Yeah.  Confidence goes before the fall, though.  I think one of the things I regret most in the past is my overconfidence.”“This is just an exercise.  If I’m wrong on this, I’ll own it.  Let me plant our flag and get my stuff to adjust my armor, I’ll be right with you.”As he said it, another wall materialized behind us.  A fort with ten foot walls was slowly forming.  Tristan wasn’t even focusing that much on the construction, attention-wise.  He took the flag before walking off.I had intentionally chosen a less level area.  We were on a hill, playing on a bit of a slope, roughly a ten degree decline with taller grass, weeds, and some pebbly dirt covering the area.  Some trees and rocks dotted the space between where their group would set up and where we would.I had a few reasons for choosing the area.  Part of it played off something I had experienced with New Wave.  The team had always been split between the fliers and the people on the ground.  Me, Aunt Sarah, Crystal and Eric had all been airborne, while my Uncle Neil, Mom, and Dad had all been landbound.  It created a dilemma in logistics, and this slightly sloped ground and uneven terrain emphasized that logistics in a way that having to go through and around buildings might in the city.Sveta functionally had a mover ability, I wasn’t sure about Chris’ capabilities, and Damsel and Rain both had some capabilities in that realm.  Supposedly.  I wanted to see how the more mobile members of the group worked in coordination with the others.It was interesting that Tristan had picked both Sveta and me.  We were both mobile and Tristan wasn’t.  Ashley’s team had three people on foot.Another reason for this particular location was Rain’s power.  It helped him keep his balance, and that was supposedly the extent of it.  When he arrived, I wanted to see if it factored in here.Finally, there was the fact that it put us out of the way.  No bystanders, no property to damage.Kenzie had her head down, her attention on her phone.  Ashley and Chris were both smiling.  All three were talking.  I waited a short bit for them to finish.“I’m so unbelievably nervous,” Sveta said.I glanced at her, and confirmed that Tristan had stepped away, rummaging in his bag.  He was out of earshot.“I definitely hear you on that,” I said.“I really want this exercise to work somehow, like Tristan said, but for different reasons.  The way you were brought in, you might have come in looking for the bad, and it’s… it’s not all bad.  Really.  I always wanted a team and the idea of finding one and fitting myself to that team with all of my problems, it seemed impossible or far away.”“Yeah,” I said.  “You talked about it in the hospital.  That you’d talked to Mrs. Yamada and other people about how, putting aside all your issues, you wanted to be a hero.”“And I wanted a boyfriend, and I wanted to be functional again, and I wanted friends,” she said, staring off at the other three.  “And I have almost all of it, but I feel like it could slip out of my grasp if things go wrong.  If this goes wrong.  I don’t know what I can do if that happens.  I’m worried this is going to be a disaster, and that’s making me so anxious.”“What can I do?” I asked.  “I don’t want you to be unhappy.”“Like I said before, I really want you to believe in us here.  I want you to give us a chance.  Even if this is bad to start.”“Okay,” I said.“And- I’m sorry if this is pushing a line or if you have reasons, but don’t be so stiff?”She sounded so uncertain as she said it.  I drew in a deep breath and smiled at her.“I’m the one with a prosthetic body.  We’re friends, right?”  She smiled, uncertain, and I smiled at her.  “So I don’t want you tense around me.”“I’m nervous in my own way, and I think that’s how it shows,” I said.  “It’s not you.  Can I give you a bit of a hug, here, emotional support?”“Please.”I put one arm around her shoulders and squeezed.  Sveta moved her head in my direction, I moved mine in her direction, knocking heads with her a bit.Off in the distance, even though she was more than a hundred feet away, I could hear Kenzie cooing and ‘aww’ing over the hug, as she looked at us.“What did I miss?” Tristan asked.“I’m anxious,” Sveta said.“Me too,” Tristan said.  “Your control gets bad when you’re nervous, right?  You have more reflexive movements?”“It gets so fucking shitty,” Sveta said.  “I’m sorry.  I’m worried I’ll be terrible because I’m all over the place inside here.  I don’t know if you can hear it, but I keep fumbling because I’ll reflexively reach out to grab something off in the distance and hit the wall of the suit instead, and then I have to reach for the right control ring again.”“Do the best you can,” Tristan said.“This isn’t about grading you as an individual,” I said.“It’s about the team,” Sveta said.  “I don’t want to let the team down.  Can we start?  I’ll get more nervous if we wait.”“Sure,” I said.The other three weren’t wrapped up in their discussion anymore.  I called out, “You guys want your flag?”“Here,” Sveta said.  She held out her hand.  I passed her the blue flag.She passed it to the others, hand and forearm gripping the flag, tendrils pushing the hand and forearm.  She stopped short, relying on only the momentum so it only punched Chris lightly in the man-boob.  He caught her hand and arm in one large hand, plucking the flag free before releasing her hand.  He smiled as he held it up, then he reached low to hand it to Kenzie.  The two of them went to plant it, with Chris picking up a fallen tree on the way.It seemed Chris and Kenzie got along better like this.Ashley didn’t join them.  Instead, she started walking toward us, picking her way through weeds and grass.  She still had a partial smile on her face from before.I flew to meet her partway.“Ground rules?” she asked, when I was closer.“Place your flag.  You grab ours and bring it to yours, or vice-versa.  Whoever has both flags at their starting point wins.  Try to avoid hurting the trees.  No personal injuries that aren’t going to heal in a day.  Bruises and scrapes are inevitable, but let’s avoid them if we can.”“Understood.”  She turned to walk away, one hand raised to give me an over-the-shoulder salute as she did.Tristan began altering the battlefield behind her, drawing out fifty little sparks to move along the surface of our side of the hill.The other team was just on the other side of a trio of trees.  The nervousness we all felt was apparent as Kenzie’s cube lit up, making a deep beep sound.All three faces of the cube that I could see had lit up.  Numbers were apparent.  ’10’…  ‘9’…  ‘8’…“It’s worth remembering that she can remotely control the cube,” Tristan said.  “Hm.”“Just the flashlight gun and the eyehook, right?” Sveta asked, giving Tristan a look.Tristan moved his hand, and finalized his alteration to the slope between our fort and the halfway point of the battlefield.  Uneven ground, raised segments and lowered ones.  Most of it was flat, the spikes sticking out of the sides or toward the ground at an angle.  The material was solid, white with orange-red in the crevices, running through it like ore in rock.The timer continued.  ‘3’…  ‘2’…  ‘1’…  ‘Go’.They came out of the trees.  As Tristan had suggested, Ashley’s plan was to go on the attack.All three of them.  Kenzie had changed, overalls gone, replaced with a skintight suit that mirrored her outfit in color and where it changed from black to pink to red.  Chris had his head turned, and he was using one hand to cram the last few feet of the dead tree into his mouth.Ashley was on foot.  White eyes were wide open behind her mask, the pupils not visible from this distance.“This is fine.  Same plan,” Tristan said, not sounding bothered in the least.Two versus three, while Sveta grabs their flag.Sveta reached for a tree and found her grip, hauling herself away.Tristan began creating barricades and obstructions, aimed at being knee-height, to slow them down.Ashley hurdled the first two.  Chris trampled his way through the three that had been put in his way.Kenzie turned, aimed, and fired her flash gun in Sveta’s direction.  She missed, aimed again, and fired.  The second shot caught Sveta in its area.“You take Chris and Kenzie, I’ll work on Ashley,” Tristan said.  He sounded confident.  “Keep an eye on Kenzie, make sure she doesn’t fall.”I flew to intercept.  Chris had one hand full with the tree, mouth distended with a fat tongue sticking out, apparently to keep the tree from rubbing against his lower row of teeth; his hand served to protect the other teeth.I was put in mind of the man I’d seen during the broken trigger, who’d had a tree come out the other direction.Chris laughed, deep and booming, tree digested.  He lowered his chin, mouth closed, hands and arms up to protect his face and guard Kenzie.I could deal with big and strong.  I flew closer- saw Kenzie turn, aiming her gun at me, and changed course, covering my face and head, my forcefield up.Even turned partially away, my arms up, the momentary flash of light blinded me.  A full second passed, and my sight didn’t return.  I could hear Chris’ laugh, Kenzie’s amusement.  My forcefield hadn’t helped.I felt the forcefield meet resistance, and I forced it to shut off before Chris’ hand could close around me.  I pushed out with my aura to try to throw him off balance and buy myself a second, and changed course.  I felt his fingers graze my back, dragging against cloth and not finding enough slack to get a grip.Blindness was disorienting.  Blindness when flying made it hard to tell which way was up and which way was down, and I knew it would get worse before it got better.I flew away and at the ground, forcefield up, and landed hard.  I felt Tristan’s creation shatter under and around me as my power absorbed the hit, fragments bouncing off of me, dust collecting on me.“Are you okay!?” I heard Kenzie call out.“I’m fine!” I replied.“Don’t give away your position if you’ve blinded them!” I heard Ashley.I heard a noise, and at first I thought it was Chris dismantling the fort.  It sounded like someone was tearing the world’s largest sheet of paper, nails on a blackboard, an alien’s scream from a science fiction movie that echoed far more than it should, a sharp explosion, and any number of other things, all overlapping and working against one another.I opened my eyes and tried to make out the surroundings despite the spots of light that were exploding against the backs of my eyeballs.Chris was large enough for me to make out his general shape.  I could make out Ashley and Tristan’s positions, but the only reason I could distinguish the two was because Ashley dressed in black and Tristan had more color to his costume.Right.  I had a few tricks up my sleeve I’d been considering.  This was an opportunity to try one.I took off, and I activated my forcefield momentarily as I did it, pushing out at the cracked chunks of stonelike ground, sending pieces rolling and sliding in the wake of my takeoff.  I needed their attention.  I saw Chris slow momentarily, mid-stride as he walked toward the fort.I didn’t fly straight for them, but around, circling closer to the fort.  I paused, giving them time to see me, and then flew straight for Chris’ face, full speed.I stopped only a few feet short, hitting him with my aura instead of my fist.  Full-strength, point-blank, a hit to the emotional rather than the physical.The reaction was much the same as if I’d punched him.  Forward movement stopped, reversed, an off-balance stumble backward.“Holy fuck,” I could hear Tristan.I heard Damsel’s response, but I had other focuses than making out the words.  It might have been ‘pay attention to your opponent’ or ‘pay attention to who you’re fighting’.I was busy flying around Chris, one hand extended so it maintained contact with him, let me gently push him, all while helping me to navigate while still partially blind.  Before he fully had his balance, I caught him by the shoulders and pulled him back and down toward the ground.He walked backward rather than topple, helped by the fact that his head was small, his shoulders and neck narrow relative to his lower body.  It was part of why his center of balance was low to the ground, with his weight gathered around gut, butt, and legs.Kenzie’s pincer-claw grabbed for my arm, then pulled my arm away from Chris.  I let it, grabbing the prehensile length of it between Kenzie and me.   Not a huge factor.  One hand still on Chris’ shoulder, I activated my forcefield, using the added strength to pull at Chris.  He continued his backward walk until he stumbled into one of Tristan’s sections of raised ground.He toppled, and I shifted my position to guide his fall for the first half of the way.  The focus on the latter half of the way was letting my forcefield down and catching Kenzie.Chris fell flat on his back.  Kenzie wriggled momentarily, and I deposited her on Chris’ chest, to make getting to his feet just a little bit harder.  The claw slipped free of my arm.My vision was clearing enough for me to see vague expressions, without precise detail.  Chris was grinning, shaking with a laugh or chuckle.“Come on, get up, get up!” Kenzie goaded him.“Get off me then!” Chris boomed.Orange motes were starting to surround them.“Victoria!” Tristan called out.  “Switch with me!”The words were barely out of his mouth when Ashley used her power again.  It was noisy to the point I worried my ears would be ringing an hour after this exercise.    I could see it as a visible blur of shadow aimed behind her and toward the ground.  She used the recoil to launch herself off to one side, to help her get around and past Tristan.  More orange motes appeared in the direction she was going.She used her power again, changing course to fly straight for Tristan.  She planted one foot on his shoulder, stepped down so her back grazed against his, her long hair draping over his head and shoulders, aimed forward with both hands, and used her power a third time just as she touched ground, her back to his.A power-augmented body-check.  The recoil of her power pushed her in the opposite direction she fired, but because she was in contact with Tristan, she pushed him too.  She stumbled, but he sprawled to the ground, his armor striking the hard platform he’d created on the slope, metal screeching and clashing against stone.The orange motes that had started to appear around Chris and Kenzie came to life around them, an especially spiky, irregular outcropping with a thin ridge extending out to the growth he’d been making in front of Ashley’s original course, which became its own vaguely pineapple-shaped formation.He’d wanted me to deal with Ashley.  Okay.  She was rolling her shoulders, rubbing at one, while she stalked toward the fort.I could see better, so I could possibly pull this technique off better.  I flew at her, and she barely seemed to pay me any mind.My feet touched ground, helping to stop me as I reversed my direction of flight to cancel out my forward movement.  I’d wanted to avoid all physical contact, but I did bump my shoulder into hers as I went from flying at near-top speed to a full stop, my face a couple of inches from hers, well inside her personal space.As with Chris, I used my emotion aura.As had been the case with Chris, the effect was immediate and profound.  She stumbled back much as if I’d flown into her and given her a strong shove, her eyes wide.I’d barely found my own footing when she found hers.  Another blast, jarring for my ears.  My vision was already suffering, and it was made worse by the plume of dust and debris around and to one side of her.  She used the blast and a push of her legs to throw herself at the wall.The moment she made contact with it, she used her power again, flinging herself out into empty space, hair and dress fluttering.My first instinct was that she was going to have a rough landing, that I might need to catch her.  Before I’d even figured out how I might do it, she used her power once more.  She was aiming up at an angle, so that meant she was pushed down by the recoil.It wasn’t a mere drop-kick or a fall, but a spearing plunge.  I did much as she’d done, pushing out with my legs in conjunction with a use of my power, my flight, to get out of her way.With the speed and general profile of a pickaxe head driven into the ground, she landed on hard ground, in the same spot I’d been standing.  There was a second where she stood there, hair draping down, hands out at her sides with fingers splayed, and then one of her legs wobbled and she dropped to one knee.“Are you-” I started.  I thought I saw her move and paused.  “Are you okay?  That landing looks like it hurt.”She raised her face and looked up at me.  White eyes behind a black mask, behind white hair.She used her power again.  Cords, columns, and shaped explosions of lensing, bending, and darkening within the roughly cone-shaped area, over the one or two seconds that she was creating each blast.  She didn’t even rise from her kneeling position.  She threw herself at me, and this time she caught me entirely off guard.  Her knees hit my shoulders, at least one of her arms caught me around the head, the fabric of her dress pulling against my face as she tried to fold herself around my head.Holy shit, was my first thought.  She was not letting up.  Every time she acted, it was with the energy of a sprinter taking off from their starting position, except her power gave her more of a push, and the jarring noises only magnified the surprise of it.My second thought was that she had seized my head.  She wanted to take me down to the ground, much as I’d toppled Chris.  There were two ways I could go.  To roll with the movement and use it, or to fight against it.My instinct was to fight against it.  I used my flight, going up when she wanted to take me down.  I used my aura, which was more effective when people were close, and she was wrapped around my head.  I used my forcefield, only for one moment, while reaching up, putting my forearm against her ribs, and pried her off of me.She used her power in the same instant she was pried off- fast enough that I was left with the feeling she had expected to use it while still holding onto me.  Her landing looked like a rough one, sprawling, one shin, one foot, one hand bracing against the ground as she skidded.I saw her slowly clench and unclench her hands, rolling one shoulder.  She didn’t stand.“Hoo,” I said.  My heart was pounding, and I fanned myself a bit with my hand.  “You do remember this is a training exercise, right?”“You do realize my team is going to win this?” she retorted.  Her hands shifted position slightly.Her face gave away nothing, I realized.  It didn’t help that with the dust, her hair across her face, and the last remaining spots of light in my vision, I couldn’t make out her pupils.  Her hands and where they were pointing were one of her tells.  Her shoulders another.  She was thin, but especially as she crouched there, hands slightly behind her and at her sides, shoulders pointing forward, I could see the muscles underneath the skin around her shoulder and shoulder blade.Was there power or Manton protection there, keeping her from dislocating her shoulders when she used the recoil to move around like that?  Was it just strength and practice?I’d relied on instinct to respond to her, and I didn’t love that I’d relied on that instinct.  I wanted to be careful and thoughtful about the moves I made and Ashley’s approach allowed absolutely none of that.  I was left to digest that I’d reacted to her by fighting, going the opposite direction instead of the Judo-like approach of using the enemy’s strength against them.Was I okay with that?  If I had to rationalize my choice, I’d fought her because I could only use the enemy’s momentum against them if I knew which way they were going, and Ashley was hard to predict.Well, just a bit less difficult now, as I stopped looking for more obvious tells.  She had stopped rolling her shoulder.  I saw the muscles tense.“Victoria!”The shout interrupted both of us, as she planned her next move and I readied my response.  It was Tristan calling.  Ashley and I both looked.“Come and help!” he called out.I flew back and away, out of Ashley’s reach, looking.Chris, legs embedded in spiky rock, was using both hands to haul what looked like a long, thin rod out of his throat.  He’d swallowed the length of the dead tree like a sword-swallower swallowed a blade, and now he was drawing it back out, changed.Narrower, thinner, smoother, and slick with fluids.Chris, it seemed, wasn’t just the kind of changer who could adapt his form.  He was the kind of changer who gained new sorts of powers while in an alternate form.He hauled the last of the tree free of his mouth.  Fifteen feet long, thicker at the end he had just removed than at the end he held, now that he was turning it around to get it in a position he could wield it.  Too long to be a proper club, not quite a rod either.Kenzie had her flash gun out.  Tristan had thrown up a short wall, just tall and wide enough that he could hide behind it.  Kenzie’s eyehook extended from her belt, through one of her hands, and out to Tristan, with a grip on his leg.  She was simultaneously trying to circle around to get at an angle where she could shoot and blind Tristan and she was using the claw at the end of the prehensile arm to try and drag him out of the cover, helped by tugs with her hand.Kenzie’s efforts left Chris entirely unmolested as he brought his weapon down, shattering Tristan’s created ground, freeing his legs.“Leave her!” Tristan ordered.  “We’ll let her get the flag, deal with these two, and catch her on her return trip!”I flew a little further away.Sveta- I looked off in the direction of the enemy’s camp.Little blue flags decorated the landscape on their side of the playing field.  They were situated on every rock, in every crevice, on every flat expanse of ground, on every tree branch.  Sveta was perched on a rock in the midst of it all.I looked at Kenzie’s cube.  One face of it was glowing.  The projector.That would be why they had been smiling, then.I started my flight toward toward Tristan.“You’ll regret ignoring me,” Ashley said, behind me.Pride, respect, they were key factors here.  I could remember the meeting, the narrowing of the eyes.  I knew Tristan was in a tough spot, but I paused, turning around in the air.  I had to raise my voice to be heard with the distance between Ashley and me, as I said, “We’re not ignoring you.  We’re dealing with you two against one.”I left her to limp toward the wall while I flew to Tristan’s side.  I landed beside Kenzie, hard, pushing out with my aura.She twisted around, gun in hand, and I caught the gun, snatching it out of her hand.“Hey,” she said.  She reached out with her hand, and I pulled the gun away.  She let go of Tristan and reached out for the gun with the eye-hook.  I grabbed the eye-hook, and then wrapped the length of the prehensile arm around her upper body, tying her up with it.“Hey!” she said, again.  She laughed.  “Chris help!”I didn’t need to ask, and I liked that I didn’t need to ask.  Orange motes began to surround Kenzie.“No, no, no, no!” Kenzie said.  “Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris!”The head of the long club was poked out between Kenzie and me, separating us.  Kenzie started to back away, and the orange motes became solid rock, encapsulating her legs.  Tristan lunged forward to catch her before her upper body came down and her head cracked down against his rocky terrain.I flew up a little ways, putting myself between them and Chris.  Chris drew the fat end of the club back, and then smacked it against his palm.  He laughed, deep and low, and pointed at Kenzie.“Stop laughing at me and help, you doofus!”I had Kenzie’s gun in hand, I could have shot Chris, but I had my deep reservations about using a tinker’s stuff, even a nonlethal gun that temporarily blinded.Ashley used her power.  I could hear the sound of it, and I saw the wall break.“By the way,” Tristan said, looking in that direction.  “We’re not catching her on the return trip.”He blurred, and with that blurring, the rock blurred too.  White with orange-red veins became clear water, reflecting the blue of the sky and the green of the trees above and grass below.  The front wall of the fort that Ashley had just penetrated and the platform that Kenzie and Chris were standing on became frothing water.With the slope, that water flowed downhill, carrying Ashley and Kenzie down to the base of the hill, amid branches, mud, and sticks.  Ashley used her power at the start and toward the end, to little effect.Chris brought his rod down, stabbing it deep into the ground, and held onto it for leverage.  It had to be sturdier than the dead tree had been, because it didn’t bend and it didn’t break.  Condensed down, maybe, shaped to be hard.He reared back, and he blew.  He’d broken down and processed more of the dead tree than what he’d used to condense it into a giant club-staff.  He exhaled a cloud of wet sawdust.I didn’t want to put up my forcefield if it would catch the sawdust, so I endured it, flew closer, and used my forcefield for only as long as it took to kick the stick he was holding onto with all of my strength.It broke, and with it breaking, Chris fell down the hill, rolling over wet grass and weeds, until he came to a stop against a cluster of two trees that had grown next to one another.He began to pick himself up, working his way up the hill, stabbing down to pierce the ground with his half-stick and plant it there like an ice-climber might use a piton.  The slope was just a little steeper at the base of the hill, and the water had become rock again, smooth and with the spikes all pointed downward, not good grips.He swallowed hard, giving me a suspicion about what he was about to do.  He spat out a ball of wood pulp and phlegm, and I flew to one side, letting it sail past me.I was put in mind of Crawler – the changer power, the spitting, the joyful monster.  Crawler had laughed too.Crawler had critically injured me with his acid spit, and that had let Amy get her hands on me the second time.It was a dark, unpleasant thought.Tristan was focused on a point off to the side.  I turned to look, and I saw that he was creating orange motes around the projector box.The motes solidified, and the box was encased in a thorny encasement of rock.I turned to look, keeping one eye on Chris, and I saw the flags were still there.“Nope!  That’s not going to work!  Good luck finding our flag!” Kenzie called out.  She loosed an over the top, mocking laugh.Tristan turned the encasement to water.“I said it was waterproofed before!  That’s not going to do anything!” Kenzie called out, before doing her level best to laugh harder, even though she had already been laughing at her limit.“It doesn’t matter,” Tristan said, loud enough for them to hear.Sveta made her way back in three moves, from the other team’s camp to a rock, rock to tree, tree to our camp.She hauled herself up to the top of one of Tristan’s walls and she held up the two flags.Ashley and Chris, who were making their way up the hill, stopped climbing.“Yes!  Yes!  That was so great, that was fun, we have to do this again!”From what Kenzie was saying, she didn’t seem to mind losing much.  She practically bounced with excitement.Tristan created stairs on the slope.Sveta joined Tristan and me as the others climbed the stairs.  Tristan put out one gauntlet, and she tapped her prosthetic hand against it.  I offered my own fist to her, and she tapped her fist against it, before wrapping her arms around me in a brief hug.A stoic Ashley had Kenzie clinging to her as she reached the top.“-were so cool, it was like how you were in the videos-”“Ease up, Kenzie,” Tristan said.Kenzie let go of Ashley, bouncing on the spot before reaching up to her lens-mask and pulling it off.  With the mask’s removal, her costume flickered in places, like an image that had been badly compressed, with heavy artifacting.“This was everything I wanted it to be and more,” Kenzie said.  “I can’t believe you found the flag.”“I-” Sveta started.“Waitwaitwaitwait,” Kenzie said.  “Wait.  Um.  Okay.  I have this covered.”“Okay,” Sveta said.Kenzie pulled out her smartphone.The projector made a sound, and then images streaked the hill, before correcting.  Ghostly images of all of us, life-size.  The images included the constructions Tristan had made.It looked like where we had all been standing earlier in the match, when I had been facing down Ashley.The images zipped around as Kenzie changed the time, blurring and streaking before correcting into their proper shapes.“I saved everything, so we can look back and watch how things played out or compare notes,” Kenzie said.  “So we can do stuff like this…”The images blurred and moved, then shifted, so the scenes that were projected no longer lined up on the battlefield.It was Sveta, perched on a branch, flag in hand.  Another blur, moving the clock back.Sveta removed one of her prosthetic hands.  Fifty or more tendrils snapped out.“You grabbed every flag,” Tristan said.“I grabbed at every flag,” Sveta said.  “I had to reposition a few times, so I probably grabbed at some fake ones several times.  It didn’t help that I couldn’t see that well after being shot.”Kenzie cackled.  Chris smothered her cackling with a large hand.  Kenzie fought back, trying to get out from under Chris’ hand, and she did a pretty poor job of it.It was weird and good to see her finally acting like an actual kid.  Too much excitement in her system, but that wasn’t a bad thing.Once Kenzie had settled down more, we walked through the entire fight, focusing on each person.  Sveta was first, easy enough.Tristan was next, and he made mention of the platform, and how he’d wanted to make sure nobody had footing when the rock turned to water, so he’d raised the ground some.  He had obviously plotted the trap from early on.“Kenzie?  Do you want to report what you were doing?” Tristan asked, once he was done explaining what he’d done to Sveta.“Wait,” Kenzie said.  “Rain’s here.  I’ll point the way.”It took a couple of minutes before Rain and Kenzie’s camera-drone arrived at the base of the hill.Chris was half the size he had been, and his proportions were returning to normal.  As he shrank, he rearranged the voluminous shorts he’d been wearing, ensuring his modesty was protected.  His old outfit was contained within a pocket on the inside of the shorts, and he gathered it together, folded up, the clothes piled on his lap, along with what looked like a pencil case.Even though he was returning to the person he’d been, physically, his smile lingered.“Rainnn!” Kenzie called out, while Rain was still making his way to us.  “Did you bring tinker stuff!?”“Yeah!” Rain responded.“Yusss,” Kenzie said.  “This is the best day.”“You could have waited twenty seconds for Rain to show up and asked him in a normal volume,” Chris said.“I wanted to know now.”Chris groaned at her, putting his face closer to hers.Kenzie groaned louder, exaggerated, putting her face closer to his.Chris groaned even louder, guttural, using some of the residual transformation to play up the sound.  His forehead pressed against hers, hard enough she had to push back to avoid being pushed over.Rather than try to top it, Kenzie sat back down.  “I like you when you’re like this.”“Naked?” Chris asked.“No!” Kenzie said.  “Geez.”“Why does it feel like every time I enter a conversation, it’s a weird topic?” Rain asked, joining us where we sat on Tristan-created seats and benches.“I like you when you’re happy,” Kenzie said.  She fussed with her hair, looking down.  “I like you a lot like this.”I was put in mind of her comments about Chris before she’d gotten in Erin’s car, after leaving the group meeting.  Like she didn’t have the worldly experience to know people didn’t say stuff like that in such an unguarded, dead obvious way.“I still think you’re annoying as shit,” Chris said.Sveta kicked him.Kenzie snorted, smiling as she looked up at him.  “I know.”“Nah.  I’m joking.  You’re fine.  I think we did pretty good.”“I think we did too.  It would have worked except Tristan and Byron are strong and Victoria is oof and Sveta was the best counter to what we were doing.  We should fill Rain in.”“That would be nice,” Rain said.  “It was you two and…”He turned to look around the group, saw Ashley, and didn’t finish the sentence.“And me,” Ashley said.“Here, I can show you the replay,” Kenzie said.  “But I want to see your tinker arms too, before we run out of time.”“There’s plenty of time,” Tristan said.“Wait, here, you take the remote, and Rain, you can hand me the arm, I won’t break anything, I promise.”Rain rummaged in his backpack, “I wouldn’t blame you if you did, it’s fragile and shitty.  You think it would help your eyehook?”“It might!  But I’m really interested in the interface.  You like to have multiple arms, you said?”“Yeah.  For what little it’s worth.”“And you control it with your brain, once it’s plugged in?” Kenzie asked.  When Rain nodded, she asked, “How does the brain know how to control it?”“I map the brain patterns for input and output and the panel here, between the attachment and the actual arm, it acts like an extension of the brain.”“That doesn’t make any sense,” Sveta said.Tristan was fiddling with the remote, and seemed to be having trouble with the progression of time, with images jumping all over the place.  Sveta, Kenzie, and Rain were all focused on the arm, with Ashley periodically joining in when prodded.Chris was sitting on the bench, cloth around him as he shrunk down to a more ordinary size.  He was smiling more than before as he rummaged for his headphones and a chocolate bar.“Your mood seems better,” I said to him.The smile dropped away.  He looked at me and shrugged.  “It’s different.  I feel more human, mentally and emotionally.”The change hadn’t seemed to make any difference in how he looked, either.  Were the changes subtle?“I’m not sure I grasped it all,” I told him.  “Once you change, it’s…?”I trailed off.“It’s like a hit of a drug,” he said.  “Focus, surprise, sadness, appreciation, disgust, fear, anger, and then this one.”“Joy?”“I call this particular flavor of it Wan Indulgence,” he said.  He bit down on the chocolate bar, then closed his eyes, clearly enjoying it.  He talked with his mouth full, “Can be enjoyment.  I’ll feel it more normally for a few days now that I’ve changed.”“Oh my god,” Kenzie said.  “Tristan, give that back, you suck at it.”Tristan was still fiddling with Kenzie’s remote for the projector box.“It doesn’t make any sense.  Why isn’t it easier to move forward and back in time?”“Because the box doesn’t perceive time, you dummy.  It perceives images.”“Why not have it perceive things like time, so you can go backward and forward in time without doing… whatever arcane thing you’re doing right now?”“Because if it perceived time,” Kenzie said, patiently, her focus on the smartphone remote, “Then it wouldn’t perceive images.  And that would be a dumb thing for a projector box that works with images.  Dummy.”“You can stop calling me a dummy now.”“I will if you stop being dumb.  This stuff is obvious.”“It’s really not,” Chris said.Kenzie sighed, very dramatically.  “Who are we following next?”“It’d be nice to show Rain the entire thing,” Tristan said.“It works best with a point of view,” Kenzie said.  She looked at Tristan and rolled her eyes a little.“If you keep that up, you’re going to see orange lights swirling over your head.  Then a rock is going to fall on you or, more likely, I’ll swap out and you’ll get a spray of cold water.”Kenzie stuck out her tongue at Tristan.I was aware that Ashley hadn’t participated enthusiastically in the conversation.  I suspected why.  I hesitated, then ventured, “I’d really like to see how Ashley approached things.”“Why?” Ashley asked.My suspicions were stronger.  I went on, “Frankly, I hope this isn’t taken the wrong way, but you’re really intimidating to go up against.”“It’s fine,” she said.  “It’s the intention.”“A big part of the reason I swapped out with Victoria is that I had no idea what to do,” Tristan said.  “I couldn’t catch you with my power, and you’re faster than me on foot.”Kenzie was changing the perspective.  She created a projection of the hillside and shrank things down, then created more projections, showing an image off to one side of our gathering, showing a zoomed in portion of what the little diorama-sized projection was showing as a whole.  The focus started with the three emerging from the trees, trampling through and hurdling the barriers Tristan created.She jumped to Tristan trying to deal with Ashley.“Those blasts are as scary as shit,” Tristan said.  “Every time you used one, even if you were five feet away and you weren’t aiming at me, I was flinching.  I saw what it was doing to my powerstuff, and I did not want that to happen to my bodystuff.”He’d realized what I was doing, and why, I realized.  Ashley was dejected at losing and we could give her a bit of a morale boost.  She seemed to like being scary.I wasn’t wholly sure it was good to feed her ego on that front, but I wasn’t sure I liked the alternative, either.“I have better control than that.  I’m not an idiot,” Ashley said.“I’m not saying you are,” Tristan said.“It’s obvious you have control,” I said.  “Kenzie, can you show the walljump?”“There are two.”“The one with me,” I said.Kenzie jumped to the scene.  Ashley leaping off of the wall with one foot, her power just starting to explode out from her hands.  The power looked more solid in projection than it did in reality.“For the record,” Kenzie said.  “If I was moving through this recording in time and not space, then I’d have to fast forward and rewind and skip around to find this, but I don’t, so I hope people are realizing why this is better.”“I’m fully in support of dumping water on Kenzie’s head,” Chris said.“The walljump,” I said.  “The sequences of blasts to maneuver and the whole-body coordination it must take.  That, to me, says control.”“All for nothing,” she said.“It was not for nothing,” I said.  “I got to see and experience what you do, I respect the spatial awareness.  The instinct-”“I fell for a trap,” she said.  “I knew there would be water and I thought I could avoid it if I used my power in time, I didn’t expect there to be so much.”“We’ve never seen each other’s powers in action,” Tristan said.  “Surprises are inevitable.  You surprised the shit out of me, many times, and I got one good surprise off.  When we do it again, we’ll know each other’s powers better.  It’s part of why we’re doing the exercises in the first place.”“I failed,” Ashley said.  She stood up, and she rubbed one shoulder.  “I was tested and I failed.”“Right from the start,” Sveta said, jumping into the conversation  “When we were standing around figuring out what we’d do, Victoria told me that this wasn’t a test of us as individuals.  It’s a test of our coordination as a team.”“I can find that on the recording,” Kenzie said.  “It’ll be hard to find, though.”“Hah,” Chris said.  Kenzie pushed his shoulder.“My team failed,” Ashley said, oblivious to the pair.  “No.  My team was set up to fail.”“Wait, woah,” Tristan said.Ashley clenched one hand into a fist.  “You realize if I hadn’t been holding back, I could have annihilated each and every one of you?”“Woah,” Tristan said, with emphasis.  “Ashley-”She whirled on him, pointing, and he flinched, going silent.  I stood from my seat.“Ashley,” I said, because I wanted her attention off of Tristan.“I’m not Ashley,” she said, her voice hard.  “Nobody has called me that in a long, long time.  I’m only Ashley because the therapists insisted and the others needed an actual name to put on the paperwork.  I’m Damsel of Distress!”“Okay,” I said.  “Can we-”I was spoken over.  “I was a member of the Slaughterhouse Nine.  They selected me.  They had me kill and maim people.  I didn’t mind doing it then, and I could do it here without blinking.”“I don’t believe you,” Sveta said.“I’ve died and I came back with only the vicious parts of me intact!  All of the warmth, the good memories, the family, they’re just a fuzzy, indistinct dream.  Those memories have no hold on me.  The killing?  Taking people’s arms and legs and watching them bleed out?  That’s clear as anything.  I could do the same to any of you.”I wanted the younger and more vulnerable members of the team to back away, to get clear of trouble, but I worried that if I tried to indicate that, it might provoke her.  Everyone was still, and nobody, myself included, was really breathing.“This was an idiotic game, and I.  Don’t.  Play.  Games.”“Count down from ten,” Rain said.Ashley whirled on him.  I left the ground, flying closer, stopping when things didn’t escalate further.“Count down from ten,” Rain said.  “That’s what Mrs. Yamada says, isn’t it?  When you’re wound up.”“It’s fine when she says it.”“It should be fine when any of us say it,” Rain said.  “Count.”Ashley tensed.  I could see it in her shoulders and the way the tendons stood out in her hands.Everyone was silent.I waited.  Ten seconds passed.  Then the fifteenth, then the twentieth.“Feel better?” Sveta ventured.Ashley turned, staring Sveta down.  “No.”“Count down from a hundred,” Rain said.“I’m not going to-”“Count,” Rain said, his voice soft.  “Please.  You’ve said before, when you get like this, there’s a part of you that’s saying you don’t want to act this way, and you can’t listen to it.  So listen to the numbers first, then listen to that part of you.”“It’s not that easy.”“It’s-”“It’s not that easy,” she said.  “And I’m going to walk away.  You do your thing.  Let me do mine.”“Okay,” Rain said.She limped away, hands in fists at her side.  We were silent as we watched her go.She walked up the hill, found a rock, and leaned against it, her back to us, and I let my feet touch ground.“We knew it was coming sooner or later,” Chris said.“Spooky,” Sveta said.”I expected a small outburst to start with.  That was-”“Medium-small,” Tristan said.Kenzie stood up, gathering her things.“Stay, Kenzie,” Sveta said.“It’s fine.”“She wants to be left alone.”“This thing?” Kenzie asked.  “It’s not you guys being the adults and me as the kid, listening to what adults say.  We’re all equal members of this team.  And this is what I’m going to do, and if I get hurt that’s fine, but this is right for me.  You can tell me what to do with some other stuff but not this stuff.”“It’s dangerous,” I said.  “Leave her be.”“No,” Kenzie said, voice firm.  She put her hand on her flash gun.  She looked at all of us, then said, softer, “No.”“Okay, Kenzie,” Sveta said.  “Go.  Be careful.”“You’re sure?” Tristan asked Sveta.But Kenzie was already jogging off in Ashley’s direction.When Kenzie was out of earshot, but before she had reached Ashley, Sveta raised one hand and said, voice quiet, “If there’s a problem, I’ll haul her back.”“That takes a second or two,” I said.  “Sparring with Ashley, I gotta say she moves faster than that.”“And your grip isn’t a hundred percent,” Tristan said.Sveta set her jaw, hand pointed at Kenzie.Kenzie reached Ashley, and with Ashley’s movement, we all tensed, preparing to act.Ashley turned back to look out at the distance, and Kenzie climbed up on the rock Ashley was leaning against.A moment later, Kenzie had her headphones out of a pocket.  She plugged it into her phone, reached down, and put an earbud in Ashley’s ear, then put another in her ear, before lying down on the rock.Slowly, Sveta lowered her hand.“Why?” I asked.“I gave my reasons before, so did Rain, so did Kenzie,” Sveta said.  “We’ve had this discussion.  This isn’t news.”“It’s one thing to know it and see it in therapy, it’s another to experience it in the wild,” Rain said.“Why?” I asked, again.  “You can’t- I understand reaching out to people, but can you really reach out to people who aren’t reaching back?  Can you give forgiveness and understanding to someone who isn’t looking for it?”“I think she is,” Sveta said.Tristan said, “I don’t know what you guys talked about, but I discussed this with the others, and I have an idea what they probably said.  Do you know how many appointments and meetings she goes to?”“It came up,” Rain said.“Okay, good.  But did you talk about why?”“Because she needs careful handling?” I asked.“Because,” Tristan said, “She’s a special case.  She’s not the original Ashley, I’m not sure if you picked up on that.”“I got the gist of it.”“Like she said, her memories aren’t hers.  She was cloned, they took her and they made up composite memories, but they had no reason to give her those fuzzy memories of other, nonconfrontational stuff.  That wasn’t Bonesaw’s work.  It’s the agent.”I drew in a breath and I sighed.“The world ended, and it ended because of them.  We can’t have a sit-down talk with Scion because we killed him.  We have a shitton of questions and the only kinds of people who can answer them are the people who got really close to the agents, like Bonesaw, who made Ashley-”I felt a chill.“-and the people like this.  Who are very little of the human, shadows of the human, and a lot of the agent.  All of us have problems, and a big part of those problems are the agents, handling their side of things.  I know I’ve talked to Rain about this, I don’t know about the rest of you guys, but when I’m talking to her I’m also talking to the agent that’s very close to the surface.  I feel like if I can get along with that agent, I can get along with mine.”“Yeah,” Rain said.“I want to get along with the human,” Sveta said.  “I don’t want to define her as the monstrous half.”“That’s fair too,” Tristan said.I folded my arms.  I looked down at Chris, and I saw that he was half-asleep.He saw me looking, and he said, “The world was invaded by aliens.  People don’t know it, we don’t like to think about it, but they’re here, they’re a part of things.  Getting along with the most accessible of them makes sense.”I didn’t like it, but I wasn’t sure how to articulate it.  My own agent had a hand in my life.  It was the wretch, the sapience behind the forcefield.  I had seen what Amy’s had done to her.Thinking too hard about it stirred up countless ugly feelings, and those feelings choked out and clouded the words I wanted to articulate.“Let’s leave them be,” Rain said.  “Let’s assume we’re not going to have our second exercise, and walk me through how things went.”“Alright,” Tristan said.As the discussion continued, I didn’t take my eyes off the pair in the distance.                                                                                           Glare – 3.4                                                                                           Kenzie sprinted toward the wall, and took a flying kick at it.  The wall broke, split at a diagonal, the upper half sliding down the split until the corner stabbed the ground.  Kenzie backed up swiftly before the section of wall toppled and fell to the ground.“I’m clearly the strongest member of the team,” she said.“You’re the lamest,” Chris said.“Can I try it again?” Kenzie asked, ignoring Chris.  “Rain?”“Be careful,” Sveta said.“I will.  I want to test stuff.  Can I try it again?”Rain stood from the rock he was sitting on, and held one hand out to the side.  The silver-white blade he created had a slight crescent shape to it.  He swung his arm and threw it, for lack of a better word.  It traced an arc, more a boomerang in flight than an arrow or thrown weapon, and cut deep into the wall that Tristan had left as a permanent fixture.  A silver-white line was left along the length of the wall.Kenzie raised her flash gun, and she shot the wall.  Nothing happened.She approached the wall, and she had her eyehook snake out from where it was attached to her belt, pincers open, slapping against the wall.  She pushed with the eyehook.“Hurry,” Rain said.Kenzie continued using the eyehook to push, to no avail.  She moved the hook around to the wall’s edge, grabbed the length of the eyehook, and pulled, adding her strength to the mechanical arm’s.Stone slid easily against stone, and the wall was pulled down, cleanly cut where the silver line had been drawn.“I could do this all day,” Kenzie said.“It’s not a bad power,” I said.“I never said it was bad,” Rain said.  He sat back down.  “It’s mediocre.  On certain days, it’s a little better.”“Better how?  Size, speed, effectiveness, number you can throw?”“All of the above, except maybe effectiveness.  And duration, I’d say.  Ten, twenty percent increase, if I had to guess.”“Duration?”“How long after I shoot stuff the line lasts.”I turned to my laptop and I started typing that up.“Not effectiveness?” Kenzie asked, as she rejoined us.  She had her phone out and walked without looking where she was going.Sveta and Tristan were having a conversation off to one side, Ashley had gone back to the library to use the washroom, which had freed Kenzie to rejoin us, and Chris was getting dressed again while under the cover of the giant-size shorts.“It’s kind of one thing or the other,” Rain said.  “Either it breaks or it doesn’t.”“I’m looking at the data from my eyehook,” Kenzie said.  “It didn’t work with your power until after I started helping it.  Twenty point two pounds of force total, that’s nine point one six kilograms, and then the break happened.  What if it’s easier to break things when your power is better?”“It could be,” Rain said.“It’s good thinking,” I said.Kenzie nodded, eyes still on her phone, and said, “Can you throw another?”“More tests?” Rain asked.“No.  Breaking stuff like this is a ton of fun,” Kenzie said.Rain stood, looked around, and then created another blade of silver-white light.  He threw it at the half-stick Chris had left impaled in the hillside.  The blade passed through the dead-tree stick, leaving a white line in it a good few feet above the ground, and continued forward as two separate segments flying in parallel, with a narrow gap in the middle.  One hit a tree, and the other hit the ground.Kenzie ran off, handing her phone to her eyehook.“What happens if you hit a person?” I asked.“I tried on livestock, a goat.  Silver line.”“And?”“The goat ran off, jumped up onto a tractor tire, then jumped down.  The impact as she jumped down was what did it.  Clean cut.”“Possibly over twenty pounds of force in that impact?”“I guess,” Rain said.Kenzie had reached the rod and found the silver line was higher than she could reach.  She began rolling a nearby rock closer, to give herself a leg up.Chris, barefoot, wearing his t-shirt and shorts, broke into a sprint.  As Kenzie climbed up onto the rock, Chris threw himself at the rod, hard, body-checking it.  It broke in two at the silver line, the top half toppling.Kenzie made the kind of high-pitched noise only a prepubescent girl could, and drew her flash gun.  She began shooting Chris repeatedly, while he rolled in the grass, laughing, arms around his face.“What happens when you hit the ground?” I asked.“Not much, most of the time.  I guess you get a fissure, but it doesn’t really do much, because the line is so clean.”“Kenzie!” I called out.She stopped shooting Chris and turned to look.“Stomp on the line on the ground?  I’m curious!”She ran off, leaving Chris where he was.“Can you explain the schedule, then?  The powers wax and wane?”Rain sighed.“Sorry, if I’m grilling you a little too much.  I’m trying to get my head around this.”“I see them in my dreams.  I never get a good night’s sleep, never dream normally.  Just… them.  And they see me.  We take turns, and when my turn comes up, I get a bit of a power up.”“That’s how you knew Snag’s description, before you knew his name.”Rain nodded.Off in the distance, Kenzie stomped on the silver line in the grass.  There was a bit of dust, and some grass stalks fell, but I didn’t see anything else.  She looked at us and shrugged.“Every five days, I get my turn, and I’m a little bit stronger.  There are other times I’m stronger, but it’s complicated.”“Every five?  There’s four others?”“Three others,” Rain said.“What’s…?”“The day in the rotation after me, it’s a blank space.  My running theory is that there was a fifth member of the cluster, but they died before the powers set in.  Free power-up, goes to someone random.  Doesn’t always line up with our power, so on those days, I can sometimes have more tinker power, or more mover power, more emotion power.  A taste of what I could be.”“Once every twenty days, on average.”“Never lining up with my days,” he said.  He sighed.  “Through the dreams I’ve seen them unmasked and they’ve seen me.  They hate me and I’m not overly fond of them.  They’re always there, every night, and it’s pretty obvious how much they despise me.  It’s where Tristan and I have that shared experience, kind of.”“People you can’t get away from,” I said.“You’re talking about your cluster?” Tristan asked, joining the conversation.  Sveta was behind him.“Yeah.”Tristan sat down on the rock beside Rain.  I scooted over so Sveta could sit beside me.“These people want you dead?  How likely is it they go forward with this hit?”“Ninety-nine point eight percent likely,” Rain said.“What’s the point two?” Sveta asked.“They all die or get arrested before they get around to it,” Rain said.“You seem pretty cavalier about traveling into the city,” I said.  “You caught a train today?”“Yeah,” Rain said.  “Again, it’s the dreams, I can pick up a little, and I can throw them off a little.  The thing about being outnumbered in this situation is that I have a lot of opportunities to pick up details.  One clue from any of them can help a lot.”“Details like?”“The woman is injured, and Snag wants to repair the arm you trashed.  That buys me a few days.  So, uh, thank you.”“The third one won’t come after you alone?”“He’s a guy, a little older than me.  Glasses.  He’s the person with the tinker power.  I haven’t picked up much about him, but he doesn’t interact with people much.  Less than Snag or the woman, and Snag is an asshole and the woman is mute, so that should tell you something.”“There’s an advantage in that,” Tristan said.  “If they aren’t socially adroit and you are-”“I’m not,” Rain said.“You’re better off than they are and that counts for something,” Tristan said.“They have money and resources, and that more than makes up for it,” Rain said.  He looked at me.  “We’re suspicious they hired Tattletale to track me down.”“Ah,” I said.  I thought about that.  “I honestly can’t think of someone worse to have on your trail.”“She’s good enough to take over a city and get away with it,” Rain said.“That’s not even it,” I said.  “She destroys people.”“Are we talking about group members behind their backs?” Kenzie asked, as she joined us.“No,” Tristan said.  “We’re talking Tattletale.”Over near the staff that had been made with the dead tree, Chris was lying in the grass, arms and legs spread, staring up at the sky.“He’s okay?” I asked.“He’s fine,” Kenzie said.As if responding, Chris chuckled to himself, lying in the grass near the base of the hill.“The Undersiders took over Brockton Bay, and they did it with Tattletale on point for most of it.  I’m not a hundred percent sure on any of this, but you can look at the events in the city starting with her taking power.  Bank robbery, Undersiders succeed, they run into the Wards, me, and my sister.  Tattletale insinuates knowledge of my sister’s deepest secrets, and mine.  My sister goes off the deep end.  ABB are provoked following an arrest of their leader and an interaction with the Undersiders, with Tattletale.  They’re toppled with a concerted effort on the part of the villains, with intel passed to the heroes by the villains.”“By Tattletale,” Tristan said.“In large part.  Empire Eighty-Eight get outed, secret identities revealed.  Undersiders are the focus of the blame, and a number of people die in the ensuing rampage.  Weeks and months of violence and chaos in Brockton Bay feed into the Endbringer attack on the city.  Half of my family died because of that.”“I’m so sorry,” Sveta said.I reached out for her hand and gave it a waggle.  “It should be noted that in the hospital after the attack, Tattletale talked to the leaders of various hero teams about Leviathan’s strengths and weaknesses.  Info that was then used to beat down Behemoth enough to let Scion finish him off.”“That could be a coincidence,” Rain said.He didn’t say it in a dismissive way.  He said it like he was a little scared, and he wanted something to cling to.I wanted to drive reality home, though.  Better to scare him and have him alive than the alternative.“Possibly.  But I’m more inclined to see her as a force multiplier or a kind of thinker version of what you do with your power, creating weak points for others to capitalize on.  We see a lot of these coincidences.  After the Endbringer, the Slaughterhouse Nine visit and do a hell of a lot of damage, but they also lose several key members.  The weaknesses of several key members are revealed and the members are removed.”“You might want to go easy on talking about those guys when Ashley gets back,” Kenzie said.“Okay,” I said.  “It’s just one data point in a series.  The last remaining mastermind of the city falls, Coil.  The PRT directors die.  Twice, in quick succession.  Weaknesses are targeted and capitalized on.  Alexandria dies in Brockton Bay, at the hands of a girl who had apparently wanted to be a hero, but who was converted to the villains’ side.  Flechette, a hero, a minor friend of mine?  Apparently converted.  Accord edges into the Undersiders’ turf.  He dies when the Behemoth fight happens.  What do you think happens with his resources and power?  Because I’m betting it’s the same as what happened with Coil’s.”“And now she runs one of the major settlement points,” Rain said.  He still sounded spooked.“Yeah,” I said.  “I don’t have all of the information, but she got to that point by being one of the masterminds and playing the game well.  She was aggressive when the city was vulnerable and she was passive when it wasn’t.  The moment Gold Morning came around, I get the impression she mobilized hard, she was ready to expand and capitalize on the situation with more of that aggression.  Again, I’m not 100% on all of that.  But I can say with reasonable confidence that she’s one of the most dangerous, capable people on Gimel.”“What am I supposed to do, then?”“I don’t know,” I said.Sveta elbowed me.  “You have to give him more than that.  You can’t scare him and not give him something.”“Please,” Rain said.I thought for a few seconds.“She bleeds,” I said.  “She gets tired, and she looked really fucking tired when I saw her.  She has a lot on her plate, and I don’t think you’re a primary focus.  Which is good.  You don’t want to be her primary focus, because people who are tend to end up in pieces, one way or another.”“Alright,” Rain said, sounding anything but.“She…” I started.  I bit my tongue.“What?” Tristan asked.“I don’t want to jump to conclusions.  I don’t want to give you the wrong impressions, either.”“Any impressions help,” Tristan said.“I don’t know,” I said.  “But what she said when I talked to her, the way she wanted to make herself out to be one of the good guys, bringing good things to others…”“Oh,” Kenzie said.  She fiddled with her phone.“It doesn’t necessarily jibe with her working with people who are out for blood and murder.  She seems to want to be a very low-key villain or even a Robin-Hood type desperado while simultaneously leaving a trail of bodies in her wake, or she wants to portray herself as such,” I said.“I’m now sharing the love and bringing some of that security, stability, and safety to others, in my very, very roundabout way,”  Kenzie’s phone said, in Tattletale’s voice.“Yeah, that’s it, thank you,” I said.  Kenzie gave me a thumbs up.  I felt a bit of the heebie-jeebies at having heard Tattletale’s voice without being braced for it.  It took me a moment to gather my thoughts before I added, “It makes me wonder what she would say if she were told that Snag and the other two were out for your head.”“She could be full of shit,” Sveta said.“She could be,” I admitted.  “Trouble of dealing with masterminds is you can’t ever know.”“Makes me think,” Tristan said.  “We really should have that talk about our group’s game plan.”“We can’t have that talk without Ashley,” Kenzie said.“Or Chris,” Sveta said.Kenzie turned to look at Chris, before giving us a very unenthused, “Yeah.”“Pretty quick turnaround on your opinion of Chris,” I said.“It’s not turned around.  It’s a love-hate relationship,” Kenzie said.  “Sometimes I really like him and sometimes I really don’t.  Right now is one of those times I really don’t.  I was having fun.”“There will be other times you can fool around with my power, and with others,” Rain said.“Yeah,” Kenzie said.  She looked at Rain and smiled.  “We’re gonna help you with your thing.”A bit of a non-sequitur, but I wasn’t going to draw attention to it.  “Do you want to call Ashley or see what’s holding her up?  If she’s not up to having this conversation, that’s okay too.”“I’ll call her,” Kenzie said, hopping up from her seat.  She wandered off, her eyehook holding her phone to her ear.“I’ll get Chris,” Sveta said.As Sveta vacated the space on the bench to my left, I turned to the laptop to my right.  I typed up a few things about Rain’s power, then paged up and down some to look at the entries for the individual powers.  There was a lot more to write up before I had an actual outline I could pitch to the Wardens.  If they were even interested in working with the overarching cape community on that level.I hoped they were.  The villains had a lot of advantages, from the fact they often had the initiative to the fact that their work often made money, and the fact that the chaos and damage they wrought often created more opportunities, henchmen, and money for them.  Heroes who did well, conversely, often put themselves out of work.One of the few advantages our side had was that the heroes tended to work together.  If we did it right, we walked away with allies.  I had people like Gilpatrick, Crystal, and Mrs. Yamada.“How’s Erin?” Tristan asked.“She’s good.  She’s applying for jobs today.  We’re in an awkward spot for it, though, not many locations, a lot of people around our age want those jobs, and it’s a long drive in to get to work.  I think those places open at six.  It might mean waking up at four to get to work on time.”Sveta dragged Chris to the collection of rocks, benches, and seats.  Chris climbed up to his seat, sitting on the rock Kenzie had been using.  I was pretty clear he was still blind, from the way he stared off into space.“There are times I don’t get to sleep until four,” Chris said, talking to the open air.“That’s not good,” Sveta said.  “Don’t do that.”“It’s a chance to be independent,” Tristan said.  “If she can get the job.  She gives off a good impression, so I can imagine it happening.”“Yeah,” Rain said.“Who is she?” I asked.  “Can I ask?”“Just a friend,” Rain said.  “I’ve always grown up in the middle of nowhere, so when my family was getting settled after Gold Morning, we saw all the incentives they were offering to people willing to get a headstart on agriculture and it seemed natural, you know?”“Sure,” I said.“Erin’s parents were kind of the opposite.  City people through and through, something in them broke after Gold Morning.  They couldn’t bring themselves to join the rat race again, I think.  They were given the option for the simple life and they took it.  Erin got dragged with.”“And you connected.”“She was having a hard time, because y’know, she stands out when a lot of people are hurt and angry and looking to lash out.  She went looking for a hiding place and she stumbled on my workshop.  She’s been a real help, from before I even had the therapy, helping me get figured out, listening to me, helping me research.  I… don’t really know what she gets out of the deal, from me.”“I can think of a few things she gets from you,” Tristan said.“I appreciate you saying that, I’m not sure I see it though,” Rain said.I saw Kenzie react to Ashley’s appearance before I saw Ashley.  She made her way up the less sloped side of the hill, holding a pair of water bottles.“Having a friend with powers is pretty neat,” I said to Rain.“Yeah.  For sure,” he said.“And while I don’t know you that well, you seem very thoughtful.”“And there’s the brooding, mysterious part of it,” Kenzie said.  “Girls like that.  You and Chris are similar like that.”“I see,” Rain said.  He frowned a bit.“I’m picturing the expression on your face,” Chris said, before laughing.“How long’s he going to be blind?” I asked.“Could be ten minutes, could be an hour or two,” Kenzie said, as she skip-walked over to sit down at Ashley’s side as Ashley took her seat.An hour or two?“You got anywhere to be, Chris?” I asked.“No family, nobody that cares that much,” he said.  “I’m one of the lost boys, living in the institution.”“I know what that’s like,” Kenzie said.  “The institution.  It’s not fun.”“Personally?  I don’t give a shit, and they don’t give a shit about me, I could disappear tomorrow and nobody would blink.”“We’d blink,” Kenzie said.“You would,” Chris said.  “But you’re lame like that.”“I’m sorry to hear about your situation,” I said.“It’s fine,” Chris said, with emphasis, still staring off into space.  Blindly, he rummaged in one pocket, pulling out a plastic kit.  “It’s- it’s freeing.  All I care about is that I eat three square meals, since nourishment matters for my power, and having a place to sleep.  Strip away everything else, and it’s all any of us want.”“Some of us want people to keep close to us,” Kenzie said.“Not me,” Chris said.  He opened the kit and drew out a pair of pliers.“Your opinions may change as you hit puberty,” Tristan said.“I’m already started on that, I’m not going to go into any details, and I really don’t think my feelings are going to change,” Chris replied.  He seemed to reconsider, then said, “I really hope they don’t.”I glanced at Ashley.  She’d been quiet since sitting down.  The last time I’d reached out hadn’t ended well.  Was I supposed to ignore her now, leave her alone while she wound herself down?“How about we talk about your idea, Tristan?” I asked.“It’s getting later in the afternoon,” Sveta said.  “And Kenzie has dinner with her parents.  It would be good to get it out of the way.”“I can skip it if I have to,” Kenzie said.“You shouldn’t,” I said.Tristan shifted position, metal sliding against smooth stone.  “The plan.  We’ve only got the broad strokes worked out, so if you want to help hammer it out, Victoria, it would really help.”“Okay.”“Protecting Rain in the coming weeks is essential.  My starting point for thinking about this plan was thinking how we might cover all the bases we want to cover.  We need to keep the older members of the group free enough to help Rain with whatever he needs help with.  Kenzie wants to do something integral to the group, and while she can help keep an eye out, it’s easy for her to take too much of a backseat role.”“Am I taking a frontseat role then?”“I’m- not exactly.  There’s a lot about this that’s counterintuitive.  My first instinct is to think, hey, I want to make money, I want to be out there doing things.  But that leaves us open to interference and distraction.  So… what if we go covert?”“Covert?” I asked.“Nobody knows Ashley is on the side of the good guys for the time being.  She’s really good at the villainous persona and atmosphere.”“Thank you,” Ashley said.“And then there’s Chris, who can be monstrous, appear, disappear, then show up again as someone or something else.”I glanced at Chris.  Chris had two sets of pliers in his mouth.  He was readjusting his braces.“The masterminds and the organizations are masterminding and getting organized.  Hollow Point is one example of that, and Tattletale’s degree of involvement, that’s another example.  I didn’t get the impression Tattletale was really aware that we were a team, so I think this works.”“Take all things mastermind with a grain of salt,” I said.“Of course,” Tristan said, quickly enough that I wondered if he’d bothered with that grain of salt.  “Okay, so what if we do like- actually, it’s like Victoria was saying a few minutes ago, about creating and capitalizing on weak points-”“She was telling us more about Tattletale,” Kenzie told Ashley.“Yeah,” Tristan said.  “Look, no rush, we do this slow and careful.  We put you guys out there, Ashley and Chris can plant cameras, Kenzie handles backend, we gather all the data we can, and we find out what the masterminds are doing and where the organizations are most vulnerable.”“Then we hit them,” Ashley said.“Maybe,” Tristan said.  “Maybe.  We assess the situation, we maybe even spread disinformation, and then we have discussions, involving other cape teams, maybe.  If it seems doable, we hit them.  We have a lot going for us if we want to blitz the enemy or ruin a plan in progress.  When it’s time to make our play, we can do big, we can hit hard, and we can move fast.  If it doesn’t seem doable, we sell the info to another cape team.”“I like that you’re thinking about the money,” I said.  “How do you sustain things if you’re going ahead and handling the mission on your own?”“I’m thinking we don’t,” Tristan said.  “I’m not wanting to set up a headquarters, we wouldn’t necessarily have employees or staff, we can figure something out for costume.”“It’s a long, hard road to gather that kind of intel and then act on it at just the right time.  It’s a test of patience,” I said.  “That patience gets tested further when your pockets are empty.”“I hear you,” Tristan said.  “It helps some that we have a lot of people here who are subsidized or not entirely out on their own.  Kenzie gets money from her parents, Chris has his meals and shelter through the institution.“I think we have an advantage there,” Sveta said, quiet.  “Because the thing that defines us, and I don’t think it defined the Irregulars like this, and it didn’t define the Wards, like Weld described them… we all need to be out there.  We need this.  That makes us stick it out.”There were nods around the group.  Even Chris.  The heads that weren’t nodding were smiling, like Ashley’s, or looking very serious in a way that made me sure they were in agreement, like Rain was.I allowed myself to nod as well.“Okay,” I said.  “I might be able to make some recommendations about funding, so you won’t be too starved.  If you think you can gather intel that others might be interested in, I can talk to other teams on your behalf, or I can point you in the right direction if you want to handle that yourselves.  You’d tell them you have the capacity to get intel.  You may or may not want first dibs on these villains, but whatever happens, if they’ll pay a token amount, you’ll give up the info.  It serves a double purpose if you set it up as a dead man’s switch.  Worst comes to worst, the authorities get an email letting them know what you were up to and who you were up against.”“They’d pay for that, you think?” Rain asked.  “Even if it’s us saying we’re taking first dibs, but we’ll give the info anyway?”“I think it could be sold to them,” I said.  “Information comes at a premium, and every single team out there is wanting as clear a picture of where things stand as possible.”“I do my thing, Chris does his thing, Kenzie does her thing,” Ashley said.  “Sveta, Tristan and I help Rain in the meantime.  When we have the intel, we hit them.  Take out key players, interfere with a key part of their business, and we leave them ruined.”“We maybe hit them,” Tristan said, with emphasis on ‘maybe’.“If we spend the time to get that far, you’ll be itching to see it the rest of the way through,” Ashley said.“And then what?” I asked, before they could get in an argument.“Hm?”“Let’s assume it’s a success, or you hand off the intel.  What follows?”“Depends on a lot of factors,” Tristan said.  “We could take another piece of data collected on the way and jump off from there, or we don’t just take money, and we go to another team and we trade intel for intel.  They tell us if they’ve got more tough nuts or tricky areas to tackle, and we use that as our next starting point.”I nodded.“What are you thinking?” Tristan asked.“I… admit this makes a lot of sense.  It may be harder than you’re picturing.  Masterminds cover their asses, organizations have a lot of tools at their disposal.”“If we get six pieces of a twenty-piece puzzle and we realize we can’t take things any further, we can still sell that intel,” Tristan said.“Absolutely,’ I said.  “I’m trying to think about how that plays out in the long-term.”“I don’t know,” Tristan said.  “There’s the stuff I just said, but I was mostly thinking about the next few steps.  I’d rather make calls based on the now and adapt later, depending on what comes up.”“That’s fair,” I said.  “I’m trying to be mindful of consequences, these days.  You’d be making enemies, once people realized what you were doing and the role you’d played.  If you’re not careful, Ashley and Chris as background observers are cards you can only play a few times, in a limited fashion.”“You can play me eight times,” Chris said, pulling the pliers out of his mouth, “After that they’ll probably catch on.”“If you don’t change your head that much, then they’ll catch on sooner than that,” Tristan said.“On that topic, I’m not sure I like Chris being out in the field like that,” Sveta said.“I’m fine,” Chris said.  “I can handle that much.”“I’m thinking Chris gets involved as a distraction.  A few minutes at a time, a monster shows up, overturns the status quo.  The kind of thing we do once every two weeks or once a month.”“Yeah.  I’m good with that,” Chris said.“I like it,” Rain said.  “I hate that I’m a burden at this stage.”“Don’t worry about that,” Kenzie said.  She reached out to give Rain a pat on the knee with her eyehook.  “We’re all burdens in our own screwed up ways.”My expression might have betrayed something, because Tristan looked my way.“Yea or nay?” he asked.“It reminds me of the Las Vegas capes,” I said.  “And a bit of Watchdog.”“Is that a bad thing?” Tristan asked.Las Vegas had been damned effective, as had Watchdog.  But where Las Vegas had been a subtle, careful player with a few questionable, mysterious individuals in their ranks making the most of their backgrounds and skills, much like this team in disposition and direction, they’d also been a team that had turned villain at a critical time.  Watchdog had been careful and scrupulous, making measured moves with the best intel and agents they had at their disposal, and Watchdog hadn’t survived Gold Morning as an organization.Those were the only two data points I had, for teams like this.  Corruption and annihilation.I couldn’t say for sure that it was a bad thing, but I couldn’t say it was a good thing either.“It’s a thing,” I said.                                                                                           Glare – 3.5                                                                                           The van bobbed with the added weight as I set Kenzie’s projector-recorder box down.  As I moved back, I nearly tripped over Kenzie, who had climbed into the van right behind me.“I’ve got the straps, I’ll tie it down,” she said.  “Thank you for doing the heavy lifting.  It really helps.”“Sure,” I said.  I squeezed past her and climbed down from the back of the van.  “For the future, if I’m using my strength, you probably want to keep more of a distance.  I wouldn’t want to bump into you with my power up.”“Oh, okay.”With Tristan having laid out his plan, the meeting was done, Tristan’s creations had been dismantled, the rocky walls and barriers broken down and placed with other rocks, and I had my laptop with my gathered notes in my bag.Kenzie’s dad was standing by the door to the van.  The others were gathered on the sidewalk in front of the library.“Are you going to be okay going home alone?” Tristan asked Rain.“If you’d asked me earlier, I’d have said yes.  I’m less sure now,” Rain said.“Sorry,” I said.“No need to be.”“I want you to know what you’re up against.  I didn’t do it to scare you, exactly.”“Knowing what I’m up against and being scared go hand-in-hand,” Rain said.  “Right now I’m telling myself we don’t think Tattletale is free enough to be tracking me down right now, and the others are injured or preoccupied.  I’m probably safe to get home like this, right?”“I’d think so,” Sveta said.  “I’d offer to come with you, but it’s a bit of a long trip.”“Yeah,” Rain said.  “I wouldn’t want you to go to that trouble, either way.”“Have you given any thought to moving?” Tristan asked.Rain shrugged.  “Every day.  Being where I am is tolerable for now, I think.  The commute to the city is a pain, but if I imagine they’re hiring a dozen mercenaries and a few others, then it could be a bigger pain for them.”“Hey Flays-Alive-Man, for this job, we’re going to need you and your ten superpowered friends to catch a train and spend three and a half hours traveling to the middle of nowhere, and then you have to find our target,” Chris said.“God,” Rain said.  “Don’t fire up my imagination with names like that.”“I do want to focus more on your situation,” I said.  “We’ve talked about the team and what the group is doing, but your situation is pressing.  We can’t keep assuming they’re preoccupied.”“I know,” Rain said.“We should figure something out, cover any surprises in the short-term while plotting out something workable in the long-term,” I said.“I agree.  You can send them the wrong signals, but they could try tripping you up too,” Tristan said.“I know, really,” Rain said.  He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, like he was about to say something, then said, “Yeah.”“I could come with and fly back, or fly over the train and keep an eye out for trouble,” I said.I could see Rain’s reaction, the kneejerk resistance.“Oh!  I have cameras,” Kenzie said, “And you could use them to communicate.  They’re not too obvious.”“I could carry a camera,” Rain said.  “Just so long as I could turn it off when I need to.”“Why would you need to turn it off?” Kenzie asked.“Because I have to go to the bathroom sometimes.”“Why would anyone use a camera to watch someone go to the bathroom?” Kenzie asked.  “No, wait, I don’t want to know.  I’ve learned my lesson about those sorts of questions.  But you can trust me, that’s not what I’m about.”“I’m glad.  I still want an off switch.”Kenzie rummaged in the back of the van and pulled out a bag.  She handed over something looked like a smoke detector in brushed black metal, with a lens in the center.  “Here.  A camera.  You can press down on the lens in the middle and it will alert me.  I’ll set it up so it lets the others know too, but I can pick up sound and visuals and pass it on to the others if you need it.  This is the battery pack.  You can pull it out and the camera won’t work.”“Seems simple enough.”“Whatever you do,” Kenzie said, reaching out to touch Rain’s forearm.  “Do not put the battery pack in backward, when you re-insert it.”Rain looked down at the camera he held with a little bit of trepidation.“Why?” I asked.“Because then it won’t work,” Kenzie said.“You said it in an ominous voice,” Chris said.“It’ll help Rain to remember not to put it in backward.  Duh.”“It’s not going to misfire or blow up?” I asked.“Why do you keep asking that?  No.  It’s a camera.  There is a very small chance of it blowing up, and if it does then it’s going to be a very small explosion.  Unless you’re very unlucky and a lot of the things that could make it blow up all happen at once.”“I guess I trust your tech more than I trust the people who are after me to leave me alone,” Rain said.  He held up the camera.  “I’ll hold onto this, then.  Thanks.”“Cool,” Kenzie said.  “You’re welcome.”“You’re not going to be looking through it and checking in on me at random, right?”“Not if you don’t want me to,” Kenzie said.“I don’t want you to,” Rain said.  “No offense.  It’s just that the less you know, the less likely it is that one of the people after me decides to come after one of you to try to get info.”“Okay,” Kenzie said.  “Not a problem.”It’s a bit of a problem, I thought.  But not like you’re imagining.Kenzie looked back toward her dad.  “And I should go.  You know how to get in contact if you have questions.  Do you want a ride?  Does anyone?”“No thanks,” Rain said.Kenzie double and triple checked with the rest of us, then looked over at her dad, who was waiting with barely any change in expression.  “I’m going to head out then.  Bye guys.”“Bye,” Sveta said.“Talk to you again soon,” I said.Kenzie climbed into the passenger seat.  Her dad glanced over the group, briefly making eye contact with me, before taking a seat behind the wheel.  She stuck her hand out the window to give us a bit of a wave as her dad pulled away.“Most uncomfortable car ride,” Rain said, watching them go.“What’s that?” I asked.“Julien Martin, giving me a ride earlier.  Kenzie sent me a text letting me know he was on his way to pick me up.  I would have said no if she’d asked beforehand.  He turned up, let me into the car, then the entire way here, didn’t say a single word.  I didn’t say a thing either.”“Am I missing context?” I asked.“Yeah,” Rain said.“It’s context for Kenzie to share,” Sveta said, her voice firm.“Yeah,” Rain said, again.“Fair,” I said, even though I wasn’t sure it was.  Not a hundred percent.  There was a point where I couldn’t do everything I needed to do if people were keeping secrets.  I didn’t want to press any buttons or tread on anything sensitive, and there were a lot of buttons and a lot of sensitive points.“We’ll get you up to speed soon,” Sveta said.  “But we have to be fair.”“Out of curiosity, Sveta, how much wear and tear did your body take out there?  Or is it bad of me to ask?” Tristan asked.“It’s not bad at all,” Sveta said.The conversation turned to armor and costumes.  I listened with one ear, but my thoughts were on Sveta’s defense of Kenzie’s background, and how careful Tristan was in asking about Sveta’s body.There was something I’d noticed with the group, and it was something I’d fallen prey to myself.  When the group was talking, it was almost always in a guarded way.  Even Chris did it to a small degree.  Ashley too.  Conversations were meted out with care, not necessarily so each person was protecting themselves, but so they protected each other.  We often slipped back into talking like we were in therapy.There were cases where individuals protected themselves and cases where individuals were also protected by others.  Kenzie had a role as the baby of the team, in a way.  There were things she didn’t disclose and things she was intentionally or unintentionally coy about, despite her overly open personality.  That was compounded by how others were ready to step up for her and defend her.  That was the security they’d given her.I glanced over my shoulder at Ashley, who was hanging back, finishing the second of the bottles of water she’d brought back with her after going to the library.  Ashley was very similar to Kenzie in that department.  Unguarded in terms of how open she was about many things, but she had things she didn’t talk about, and she benefited heavily from the group’s defense of her.It was the contract between them, the language they used and their habits, it carried over from the group.  It was going to change over time, I was sure, especially if their therapy with Mrs. Yamada ran its course.  I wasn’t sure if that meant the dialogue would become natural, if the contract would be betrayed in small ways, or both.I was, as much as they’d asked for my help, the interloper.  They protected each other from me, even if it meant Sveta was protecting someone as troubled as Ashley from someone she saw as a friend.  I suspected it ran deeper than her wanting to see Ashley’s humanity win out over the monster.Getting the information on powers and on the most important things like Ashley’s situation was easily doable, because it was need-to-know.  Where I ran into a stumbling block was that their view on need-to-know and my view differed.I worried they had too light a view of things.  The ones who didn’t were among the more guarded, and they were being guarded too.It all knotted together.  Was I supposed to be patient and wait for the information to come out?  Would it come out only as each crisis reared its head?  Or did I push and risk doing damage?I could push lightly.  I waited for Tristan to stop talking about his armor, and the tools he used to fix the scuffs.I wasn’t the only one waiting for a break in the conversation.  “I should probably go or I’m going to miss my train.”“My offer stands,” I said.  “An eye in the sky, if you think you’ll need it.”“No,” Rain said.  “I’d rather-”He stopped at that.“What?” Tristan asked.Rain went on, “It’s my experience that when you’re in trouble, people are usually pretty good about offering help and support.  People are good like that.  I’ve seen it with family members that had babies, and people who lost loved ones.  Everyone turns up and offers their support, they bring food, they say they’ll be there.  And they are, at first.”“You think we’ll get bored of this and not help you later?” Tristan asked.“Not bored,” Rain said.  “Shit happens.  Everyone has their issues, things come up, and then they lose sight of the promises made to new parents, the bereaved, or whoever else.”“I think that’s pretty unfair,” Tristan said.“It’s reality,” Rain said.  He looked at me, “It’s nice of you to offer, Victoria, but I’d rather have you come and keep an eye on things when I feel like I’m actually in danger, instead of coming now, realizing what a huge pain in the ass it is to fly that far out of your way, and then feeling reluctant when it counts.”I thought about reassuring him, pointing out that I’d traveled from the Bridgeport span to the portal in New Haven to Brockton Bay, several times a week, to get notes, check on the wreckage of the house and visit Crystal’s family.  I didn’t.“Gotcha,” I said.  I’d pushed, I wasn’t going to push harder now that the boundary had been raised.“You’re still blind, Chris?” Sveta asked.“Yep.  It’s starting to come back, though.  Thirty minutes to an hour, I think.”“Do you want someone to stay with you?” Sveta asked.“No.  Hell no.  Then I’d feel obligated to make conversation and shit,” Chris said.  “It’s a sunny day, there’s a breeze, the weather is perfect.  I’m going to sit outside and wait and then I’ll make my way back to the institution.”“They won’t be bothered if you’re late for dinner?” I asked.“So long as I’m there by lights out, they don’t care.  They’ve got twenty staff and over a thousand kids in the building with dead or missing parents.  I eat or I feed myself, I mostly do the chores I’m assigned, I’m there when I’m supposed to be.  There’s lots of others who demand more attention than I do.”“It sounds like the children at your institution are pretty vulnerable,” Sveta said.  “Nobody paying attention to what they’re doing with their days.  Any of you could be pressed into work or preyed on or you could end up disappearing, and nobody would know.”“Not me,” Chris said.  “They’d regret it if they tried with me.  With triggers being a thing, they might regret it whoever they try it with.”I was put in mind of my mom.  “It doesn’t mean the damage isn’t done before powers come into the picture.”“Yeah, well, I dunno,” Chris said.  “I’m going to relax and wait until my vision comes back.  If it takes too long or if I run into trouble, I’ve got another change I was wanting to make today.  Keen Vigilance.  Perception focused.  It’ll give me a fresh set of eyes.”“Okay,” I said.The others got themselves sorted out.  Rain, Sveta, and Tristan started their walk to the train station.  Chris retreated toward the library.Ashley remained by the sidewalk, drinking her water.  She’d been dead quiet.“You good?” I asked her.“I was dead for years.  I’ve been operated on, feeling every last movement of the scalpel, several times.  This is nothing, so yeah, I’m good.”She put a curious inflection on the word.It was eerie to think of Bonesaw’s involvement in things.  Her handling of Ashley here, how the Slaughterhouse Nine had got Blasto which had led to Fume Hood’s downward spiral.  It made me think of Crawler, and it made me think of what had happened to my home town.To my home, my living room shattered with monsters left lying in places where childhood memories were supposed to be.  Monsters that had once been people, a few of them genuinely good and decent.Heroes, even.To my family.  To the person who had once been closest to me.“Right.  Good to hear,” I said.“We’re similar, I think,” she said.I paused.  I’d been taking a second to think about how I would gracefully exit.  Now I was left to process what she’d said, and figure out how to gracefully answer that.“Should I take that as a compliment?” I asked.“Take it however you like.  Them?  They’ve experienced hurt.  They’ve known horror.  Maybe not so much for Kenzie, but she experienced enough hurt that it balances out.”“I probably shouldn’t be hearing this,” I said.“They haven’t seen the worst of it.  They haven’t seen rock bottom and then had someone or something reach up from below and drag them deeper.  The Slaughterhouse Nine were that for me.  I got the impression from how you talked about Tattletale that she was that for you.”No, I thought.  Only in small part.“My first take on you was that you knew enough to be useful.  Then you talked about Tattletale, and your reaction to someone who has the information, who’s careful, and who has resources?  You’re afraid.”“I’m concerned,” I said.“I respect it, that fear.”“Concern,” I said.  “If it was just fear for myself, that would be one thing.  But I’m concerned about the others here.”“It’s a very concerning world, isn’t it?” she asked.  “There’s a lot to be concerned about.  You and I, we have our eyes open about that, even if we’re taking it in very different directions.”“Are we?” I asked.  “Aren’t you giving this hero thing an honest shot?”“I am.  It’s not going to work out, but I’ll be here until the end.”“You sound pretty sure about the fact that it’s going to go south.”She tipped back her water bottle, finishing it off, and without even lowering the bottle from her mouth, used her power.  Shorter than her prior uses, abrupt.  It made its usual cacophony of noise, my ears ringing faintly in its wake, and it pushed her hair up and back, so it took  a second to fall back into place.She caught her balance, taking a second before she stood straight again.  Then she looked at me with eyes that had no pupils, no irises, only the white, and only the dark makeup to draw out the eyelashes.  Slowly, her pupils faded back in.All to dispose of a water bottle, apparently, or to make a point.“I’m not even the most fucked up person on this team, Victoria,” she said.  “I might not even be in the top two.  Our therapist knows, and that’s why she was concerned enough to reach out to you.  They, the really fucked up ones, they probably know.  But I know it too, which makes me pretty certain.”“Yet you’re still here,” I said.“So are you.”“I’m cursed with an impulse to help people,” I said.“It’s an epidemic,” she said.“Guess so,” I said.  I used my flight, my feet rising an inch or two off the ground.  “I think I’m going to take off.”She gave me a small salute, her expression dispassionate.I didn’t want to give the impression I was running, so I asked, “See you in a couple of days, then?”“Yeah.”I flew skyward, at the speed and angle that made even my stomach do that overly light flip-flop at the distance between myself and solid earth.  I came to a stop when I couldn’t see the library anymore.I didn’t fly home.  I had too many thoughts in my head, and after seeing the others, seeing personalities and outbursts from Tristan’s comments for Byron to Ashley’s more dire threats, the powers, the secrets that were being kept or barely suppressed…I remained in the air, the ground a blur beneath me, the clouds not all that far above me.  The city was painted in its golds, its concrete and pavement with yellow paint, its grassy patches, its fields of wheat and corn.Just me up here, the wind in my ears.I believed Ashley.  It wasn’t that she was honest, she wasn’t.  She bluffed and she bluffed often.  I suspected the bluffs were because she’d been telling me the truth when she’d remarked on the common thread between us: we’d seen some of the worst the world had to offer and we had reason to be afraid.I believed her when she said there were people on the team who she saw as more ‘messed up’ than herself.  I had my suspicions about who.Something was up with Chris.  Mentally and emotionally he was compromised.  Physically, compromised.  Socially, in terms of where he fit into the world, again, he was compromised.  He’d almost revealed the least of himself of anyone present.Rain was another issue.The team supported and insulated its members, they protected one another from the interlopers and the outside stresses.  There were times and places that could be good, but I could just as easily see things go in a direction where outsiders weren’t sufficiently protected from the group, while the group carried on like this.My job, in a way.I’d keep an eye on all of them, of course.  Kenzie could be a danger, and I could see even Sveta going to a bad place, however much I liked her.  Tristan was strong, and he spent half of his life locked away in a lightless, motionless prison, only a window that looked out through his brother’s eyes and listened through his brother’s ears.  It would be so easy for him to go off the deep end.  Ashley was unpredictable and dangerous, pure and simple.Chris I could only keep an eye on.  Rain-I didn’t fly back to Crystal’s.I flew to the train station, and I held a position where I couldn’t make out the people, but I could make out the train.I was paranoid, and too many things today had prodded at my paranoia.  There were many I was helpless to do much about, but I could act on these suspicions.A train came, traveling west-to-east.  I knew Sveta and Tristan would be boarding it.  Had I been on foot, it was the one I would have caught.When the other train came, traveling the opposite direction, I followed it.  I had a pit in my stomach, doing it, but I had a gut feeling that this was part of why Jessica had reached out to me, and why she had been relieved that I was keeping an eye on things.Yes, they knew things about each other.  But they kept secrets.  There were evasions, walls that were thrown up.I just didn’t understand what Rain was doing.  To have a hit out on his head and reject an escort, holding firm to that rejection even after having the danger driven home?“What’s going on, Rain?” I asked.  Where I was, suspended in the sky, wind rushing past me, there was nobody to hear.I was prepared to follow him to Greenwich.  It was a lengthy trip, and it left me to think about grabbing dinner, possibly on the trip back.  I tempted myself with thoughts of a burger or a good souvlaki roll.  Something warm, as I thought on it.  This high up, there was no heat radiating up off the ground or nearby surfaces, less sunlight bouncing around with light energy dissipating and becoming heat, and the steady wind flowed past me to swipe the warmth that my body put out.  As stakeouts went, this was liable to be cold, and I’d have to figure out something for bathroom breaks.As self-imposed missions went, it wasn’t just hard for me to justify doing this, it was a pretty rough experience.  The mind-numbing dullness of a sit-and-watch stakeout combined with the hypnotic nature of a long-distance drive.  Drivers, at least, had to watch the road and be mindful of other drivers.  I had nothing to help keep my thoughts centered.From Stratford to Bridgeport.  I had my binoculars out, and I watched for trouble, studying the people boarding the train.Nothing obvious.The train carried on its way, traveling from the Bridgeport neighborhood to Fairfield span, past the community center that had been attacked at Norfair, and then onward to Norwalk station.  Kenzie’s neighborhood.There were stops where only a pair of people left, stops where only a few got on, and Norwalk, unfortunately, was one of the major stations.  I couldn’t track everyone that boarded.My thoughts were preoccupied, thinking about what I was doing, my doubts, my frustration that I couldn’t effectively watch out for trouble while doing this the way I was doing it.  It was too easy for someone with powers to board the train and go after Rain while uncostumed.  Was it likely?  No.  But I wanted to justify what I was doing.There was a chance, though, that when Rain got off the train, he would be followed by fellow passengers until he was in a place where he could be attacked.  I could watch out for that.I could watch out for any unexpected stops, and I could keep an eye out for the old staples of railway robberies and ambushes – trains moved slowest when they went around corners, so I could keep an eye out for ambushes and unexpected boardings that took place in those locations.With my thoughts caught up in things as they were, I nearly missed it.The train was old-fashioned in look, cars linked by couplings, and passengers could move between cars, with the space between each car being open to the air.  Periodically passengers would step out to smoke or get fresh air.  Most were parents with kids.At the caboose, a figure had stepped out onto the back.  Rain.He climbed over the railing and jumped, while the train was going well over a hundred miles an hour.Hands out to his side, his bag in one hand, other empty, his feet touched the slope, and he stopped.  No momentum, nothing to suggest he’d been on a speeding train a matter of seconds ago.  The fact he stood on a slope didn’t seem to matter, as he didn’t slide, slip, or fall.He looked around, but he didn’t look up, and I wasn’t sure he would have seen me if he had.  He jogged down the slope, and walked across a field.  Past the field was mostly wilderness and dirt road.Rain walked for ten minutes to get where he was going.  Erin had parked under a modest little bridge in a town with one gas station.I didn’t feel good, watching them interact.  I felt guilty for spying, even though his actions proved he was being dishonest.  I watched Rain make conversation with his friend.  Minutes, where he did most of the talking, pacing some, while Erin leaned against the side of the vehicle.He must have asked something, because Erin shifted position, reaching through the window.  A second later, she drew her hand out.  She had a handgun.It didn’t mean anything.  This was justifiable, given his situation.  Lying about where he lived and where he was going was justifiable.  Even his friend carrying a gun made sense, when he was being hunted.His story about how they met and where she came from… I wasn’t sure.  It didn’t feel like I knew the whole of it.If they’d traveled again, I might have watched to see where they went.  If they’d gone to one of the smaller equivalents of Hollow Point, it might have told me something.  If they met certain people, it might have proven out my suspicion.They went to get ice cream in the dinky one gas-station town, and I couldn’t conscience staying to watch.I flew home.⊙I let myself into Crystal’s apartment through the sliding balcony door.“…ave site?” a male voice.“Whenever I’m traveling in that direction,” Crystal said.“That’s good to hear.  I keep meaning to travel out that way, but…”“It’s a universe away.  I can go with you sometime, if you want.”“That might be nice.”I shut the balcony door.  I could have closed it silently, but I didn’t.Crystal, standing at one corner of the living room, had the door open, but she stood in between the door and doorframe in such a way that her body filled the gap.  She twisted around to look at me, and I saw a forcefield start to be painted out.“It’s okay,” I said.The forcefield winked out.“You sure?” she asked.I nodded.She opened the door wider.  My dad was in the hallway, wearing a sleeveless top with a hood, in a very light fabric, and yoga pants of similar light weight.  A gym bag sat on the floor by his feet.“You’ve been flying,” he said.“Yeah,” I said.“That’s good,” he said.  “That’s really positive.”“I guess,” I said.  “How are you?”“I’m noticing how empty my apartment feels, a lot.  That’s not me trying to guilt you.  It’s me realizing where I’ve wound up and wondering how I got myself here.”“Yeah,” I said.“Do you want to invite him in?” Crystal asked.  “I can fuck off if you need me to.  Or you can take over door duty?”“I wouldn’t ask you to fuck off in your own place.  Are you getting tired of standing guard?” I asked.“A bit.”“We can invite him in.”My dad entered the apartment.  “Sorry to drop in.”“Is that what this is?”“I worry, when you drop all communication.  I thought I would at least ask Crystal if you were okay.”“I see,” I said.  I walked around behind the couch, putting it between myself and him, and leaned forward on the back of it.He took a seat on the armrest of the armchair, one foot on the ground.  “I want you to know that what happened at your mom’s house, I’m sorry about that.  It wasn’t right.”“I appreciate that.  I… I wish I could tell you that I was sorry for how I reacted there.  But I don’t know if I can.”“I wouldn’t ask you to,” he said.  “I think any and all of us should be understanding when it comes to old wounds.”Old wounds, I thought.Were they that old?  Didn’t ‘old’ presume they’d healed over or that things had been addressed or mended somehow?“I guess,” I said.  “What mom did, I was pretty vocal about why I was upset about it.  Did Crystal explain why I was bothered by what you did?”“She deflected my question when I asked.”“If you noticed it was a deflection,” Crystal said, “I need to work on my patter more.”“Just a bit more,” my dad said, smiling slightly.“Sorry to interrupt,” she said.“It’s okay,” I said.  I paused.  “You realize, dad, the reason I felt betrayed wasn’t that I thought you were in on it or anything, right?  I felt betrayed because you let yourself believe mom’s words more than you believed everything you saw in years of living with me, after visiting me in the asylum, after seeing how I function and how I don’t function.”“I’m not going to try to defend myself,” he said.  “You’re absolutely right.  I let myself be stupid.  I have a way of doing that when I’m around your mom.”“I just don’t understand how you wouldn’t just stop and realize it doesn’t make sense.  When you know about the nightmares and the fact I hadn’t flown in months, and the fact I don’t even want to talk about her, you’ll believe I’d be willing to meet her face to face and have a meal?”“It’s not that clear cut.  Your mother is a clever woman, to the point she can outsmart herself.  She has good instincts when it comes to getting people on her side, too.  I’ve been missing home, the past few years, and seeing the woman I still love being warm for the first time in…”He trailed off.“Since twenty-eleven,” I said.“Yeah,” my dad said.  “With food I’ve been aching for for just as long already cooking, the kitchen and barbecue rich with that smell.  Things, like I said, that make me stupid.”“What food was it?” I asked.“Laser seared kebabs,” Crystal said.I bit my lip.  Family recipe.  With my lip still between my teeth, I said, “Okay.”“I’m not making excuses,” my dad said.  “I should have clued in.  When Amy turned up and I knew you were coming, it wasn’t framed like a reconciliation.  It was framed as you knowing everyone was coming and you would have things to get off your chest.  Carol said she would referee and I knew it would go poorly if it was just her, so I offered to help.  While I was offering I wasn’t stopping to think.”“Was a part of it you just wanting things to be normal again?  The four person nuclear family back together?”“Yes,” he said.  “I’m not about to lie here.  I- yeah.  Yes.”It hurt, hearing that.  Knowing my dad and where he wanted to be were that far away from where I was and where I wanted to be.“I’m sorry,” he said.  “I let my guard down when I should have had it up to protect you.  I wanted you to hear that apology, and I wanted to make sure you were alright.”“Crystal and I are looking after each other,” I said.“Absolutely,” Crystal said.“That’s great,” my dad said.I rubbed my arm, wrist to shoulder.  “I’m giving some limited direction to a team of heroes right now.  It’s messy.”“Any team is bound to be.  It’s good that you’re doing that.”“Messier than most,” I said.  I paused.  “Top one percent of messy.”“Ah, I see,” my dad said.  He rubbed his chin.  It was late enough in the day that the stubble he usually had on his chin was more of a shadow.  “The Dallon-Pelham family never does anything the easy way, does it?”“No we don’t,” I said.“Can I help?” he asked.  “Advice, support?  I don’t have a lot of money, but…”“I’ve got the team outlined on my laptop.  Six people, either under eighteen or in the vicinity of eighteen.  One complicated case, age-wise.  Um, this doesn’t leave this room, right?”Nods from both Crystal and my dad.“They’ll probably go covert.  Gather and sell info.  I think I can pitch that to the big teams and get the initial funding.  I might be able to get costumes through them as well.”“They have the infrastructure set up for costumes,” my dad said.  “They’ve got most current members outfitted, and I’ve heard rumor of them branching out to supply other teams and heroes.  I would be very surprised if they said it wasn’t doable.”“Perfect,” I said.  That helped if and when it came to negotiating.  I held up my hand.  “Funding, costumes, target… target is hard to pin down.  A lot of low-level threats out there, banding together.”“If you’re keeping an eye out for the criminal populations that aren’t joining larger groups, the places you want to keep an eye on are the Cabin, the Tea-Shop, the Pitstop, the Rail, and the Greens.  Those last three places are pretty seedy and traditional villain bars.  The others are villain bars without the bar part.”“What about the ones who are hooked into bigger groups?” I asked.“That gets more complicated, and it’s less about the places to watch and more about the names to keep an ear out for,” my dad said.  “Marquis, Goddess, Lord of Loss, Mama Mathers, the Crowley brothers, Deader and Goner, Barrow.”I knew the names and I knew where they were situated.  No big surprises there.  I nodded to myself.  Marquis.  So casually mentioned.“How messy is it?” my dad asked, his voice softer.“They’re young, some of them are kids, and I’m not positive they’re all going to survive the next two weeks,” I said.  “And that’s not even- there’s enough other mess I could almost forget about that danger hanging over their heads.”“You’ve taken them under your wing?”“Yep.  I’m going to at least point them in the right direction, I hope.  I might be the wrong person for the job, but someone has to do it, right?”“Wow,” my dad said, barely audible.“What?”He shook his head.  “It’s hard to articulate.”“I’m trying to play this slow, keep it calm.  I know a lot and I’ve been down some of these roads.  I’m hopeful I can at least keep things from getting out of control.”“That may be a tall order,” Crystal said.“Maybe,” I said.  “If they absolutely insist on getting out there and mixing things up, I’ll point them in the direction of the asshole villains who are ramping up their activity and taking things over.  The nascent Tattletales and Marquises.  Kneecap them or their plans before they can get too big.”“You really are your mother’s daughter,” my dad said.My eyebrows went about as high up as they could as I turned my full attention toward him.“What you said before, and what you said just now.  Those words could have come from her mouth in a different time and place.”“This isn’t winning points with me,” I said.“I’m not here to win points,” he said.  “I want to make sure you’re safe, sane, and healthy.”I noticed the implication of what he was saying.  That taking this course might not be one of those three things.“What should I be doing different?” I asked.“I don’t know,” he said.  “I don’t think any of it is wrong, but I haven’t always been the best judge in the moment.  I’d say CYA.”“On what front?” I asked.“Do you have counsel on call?”“I wasn’t aware we even had a legal system yet.”“We don’t, but it’s coming soon.”Counsel on call.  It was common for new teams of heroes to have a lawyer available, who they could call and outline the situation to before they took action.  Covering their asses, making sure the arrests could stick, that there was a voice with the authority and knowledge to talk to the police and courts if and when the heroes’ actions were questioned in more depth.It wasn’t a bad idea.  It hobbled things, slowed them down, it was a bit of a headache… but having a lawyer as a hoop to jump through could restrain some of the more impulsive parts of the team.  I’d have to run it by them, but it made sense.“I could ask around,” my dad offered.  “But if you really wanted a good perspective on who you could talk to, there are better people to ask.”“You mean mom,” I said.My dad nodded.“Yeah,” I said.  I clenched my fist and relaxed it.  “I’ll talk to her.”“You really want this.”I thought of the team when it had been operating together, playing off one another, being good at what they did.  I thought of Tattletale and her version of my hometown and how much I really wanted her and people like her to lose every reason they had to be smug and confident.I wanted to bring those two ideas together into a concrete reality, and I wanted it badly enough I was willing to go have a conversation with my mom when I was really fucking pissed at her.If it meant wrangling this team that was going to do what they were doing whether I was involved or not, I’d do that.“I feel like whatever I say, you’re going to say I’m just like mom again, and then I’m going to be mad at you,” I said.“Can’t have that,” my dad said.“Putting all of that stuff aside,” I said.  “If I walked away, if I left it alone, I’m scared of what would happen to people who didn’t deserve it.  I can’t do that.  I don’t know if that’s the Carol in me talking, but it’s the truth.”My dad nodded to himself.  “That’s not your mom talking, I’m pretty sure.  Similar, but… not your mom.”He didn’t even need to say it.  The moment I’d seen the look on his face as he’d opened his mouth, I’d realized who I’d been echoing.                                                                                           Glare – 3.6                                                                                           Group Text (@ Ashley Stillons, Chris Elman, Kenzie Martin, Rain Frazier, Sveta Karelia, Tristan Vera)Me: Morning, everyone.  I’m planning to swing by the Wardens HQ today.  Some Qs for people, going to talk to a family  member about what you guys might need to do legally.



Me:  In interest of not taking over your thing, anyone want to come with?  You can make calls & be involvedAshley S:  I have appointmentsSveta K:  I can come. I know my way around.Kenzie M: I’ll come! are you going in the morning or afternoon?



Kenzie M: I can have my parents call in to school and get me out for the day if I have toSveta K: I don’t want your schoolwork to sufferMe: AfternoonKenzie M: I’m an A+ student I can miss a daySveta K: No you can’t.Me:  It’s best to stick to the rules of the old days.  Try to keep grades where they were before you joined a team.  If you can miss your study group for this that’s ok.  We meet at 2Kenzie M: cooRain F:  Can’t make itTristan V: count me inMe: Sveta, Tristan, Kenzie, & me then.  Chris is welcome if he wants.  2pm at the front doors.  Take extra time to travel, P.transportation strike may futz things up⊙I’d had to take the train to get to the Wardens’ HQ.  It was a fortress of a building, indomitable, and it was situated near the largest cluster of portals in Gimel, very possibly the largest cluster of portals in all the known worlds.I looked  up at a knight in plate armor with his bowed head, both hands on the pommel of a sword, with the tip resting on the ground.  A cloth wrap partially covered the legs, like a flag worn around the waist, long enough to reach the knees in front, and to drape near the ankles at the back.  Two shields stood behind the figure, hanging in the air at a height and position reminiscent of folded wings.It was typically simplified when shrunk down for website images and badges, the position of arms, hands and shields suggesting the lines of a ‘W’ for the first letter of ‘Wardens’.  Here, it was four stories of statue, built into the front face of the building.It put me in mind of Gilpatrick’s speech.  Five pounds of gun, fifteen pounds of armor?  No.  Here, at this scale, it was fifty tons of sword, a hundred and fifty tons of armor and shield.  Every inch and pound of its composition was symbolism.“It’s something, isn’t it?” Tristan asked.“Yeah,” I said.  “It’s something.”I turned to look at him.  He’d just walked up to stand beside me. He’d tidied his hair some.  I had the impression he’d started to dress up for the occasion and his other impulses stylewise had taken over.  His shirt was a button-up, red silk, with buttons in twos at the regular intervals.  He wore it very casually, with the sleeves rolled up and the buttons undone at the collarbone.  He’d paired it with a nice pair of black jeans, and he’d painted his hair a red that more closely matched his shirt.“Reminds me of that video that circulated online for a bit.  Chevalier and the last fight against Behemoth,” Tristan said.“Absolutely,” I said.  “Probably intentional.  It’s a good mental image to have, the hard fight and the great improvements that follow.”“And the disaster that followed that?” Tristan asked.I frowned at him.“It’s reality,” he said.“It’s a little pessimistic,” I said.  I glanced back.  I spotted Sveta making her way up the steps from the sidewalk to the raised bit of ground in front of the building.  “Hey!”She wore a black dress that gathered together as a halter neck, with tights covering the legs.  She’d redone some of the paint on her arms and shoulders, the paint around the ball joint and along the shell that encased each arm fresh and glossy.“You guys dressed up a bit,” I said.“We exchanged some texts,” Tristan said.  “I think we psyched each other up some.”“I was redoing my paint after all the running around and tree climbing yesterday,” Sveta said.  “I started overthinking things.”“You look good,” I said.“Thank you.  You too.”  I was wearing a very similar outfit to when I’d been job hunting.Kenzie was last to catch up to us, running up the stairs.  Knee-high socks, a skirt with overlapping stripes, and a blue sweater in a light material, worn over a shirt with the collar poking up through the neckhole.  The pin in her hair looked like a bow, but it was two-dimensional and metal.“Did you go home to change?” Tristan asked.“No,” Kenzie said.“You actually wore that to school?” he asked.“It looks nice, thank you very much,” she said.“I agree,” I said.  “I might have worn something similar when I was around Kenzie’s age.”“I can understand you not getting bullied,” Tristan told me.  “Your parents are superheroes.”“I don’t get bullied either,” Kenzie said.  “I wouldn’t mind if I did.  It would at least mean my classmates would pay attention to me.”“They don’t?” Sveta asked.“Feels like everyone’s busy with their own thing,” Kenzie said.  She looked up at the statue that stood in relief from the front of the Wardens’ headquarters.  “Still hurting from recent losses.”“We’ll see what we can do to keep future losses from happening,” I said.“Absolutely,” Kenzie said.Inside the building, statues of key members stood off to either side of the lobby.  Chevalier, Narwhal, Valkyrie, Legend, Cinereal, Stonewall, Topflight and Miss Militia.  The building was set up so the people on the second, third, and fourth floors could stand at the glass railings and look down at the lobby, and vice versa.  People in business clothes were walking every which way, upstairs, and people on the ground floor were free to peruse the gift shop or wait for tours.There were larger display boards set up around the edges of the lobby, much like the maps that were stationed around malls, but these showed off the icons for each of the teams under the Wardens’ umbrella.  They might have been touchscreens.  There were screens for Advance Guard, Foresight, the Attendant, the Shepherds, and smaller teams like the Kings of the Hill, the Wayfinders, and the Navigators.  The screen for the Attendant was still up, but it was dark, only the faint outline of the Attendants’ icon on the screen.  The Shepherd’s screen had been moved forward and to a position of more prominence.It was darker than the PRT offices had been.  The aesthetic of the PRT of yesteryear had always been predominantly white, with black stenciled letters and icons, the periodic bit of chrome or mirror when tech was required.  Here, it was dark stone, lined in gold or brass, and the lighting made me think of a cinema with lights set on high ceilings and tuned to be unobtrusive.  It was transparent and open in layout and the suggestion of there being very few barriers, like with the glass railings, or the way that it really looked like anyone on the ground floor could go anywhere without checkpoints or security.“Where are we going?” Sveta asked.“I should check on my mom first, see if she’s free for a short conversation.”“Where is she?”“Legal or Liaison.  I’ve been here twice before, but the first time they were still getting everything put together, and I don’t remember much from the second.”Sveta turned around slowly, then pointed.“Good,” I said.  “Thank you.”“Are you on good terms with your parents these days?” Sveta asked.“I’m…” I started.  “No.”“Is she going to help?” Tristan asked.“I don’t know,” I said.  “It’s not that kind of bad terms, where she’d say no, I don’t think.”“Is it the kind of bad terms where you invite someone to come with you so you don’t have to worry about the ‘rents being super embarrassing and lame?” Kenzie asked.“If I had any idea on what she might say or do then this would be easier,” I said.  “I think it’ll be fine.”The stairs led from either side of the front desk to the second floor, going around the statue-in-relief that mirrored the one on the front of the building.  The security checkpoint was on the second floor, more or less hidden behind the statue and the slab it stood out from.  Glass walls separated the walkway from the offices and departments  around the building exterior.“Names?” the man at the desk asked.“Victoria Dallon, Sveta Karelia, Kenzie Martin, Tristan Vera,” I said.“Intentions?”“We have an appointment with Foresight on the fifth floor.  I was also hoping to stop in and see my mom at her workplace.  I’m not sure if she’s at Legal or Liaison right now.”“Her name?”“Carol Dallon.”“One second.”The person made a phone call.  I waited, a little nervous, emotions stirred up.  Anger, frustration, disappointment, worry.Kenzie had her chin at the top of the railing, as she looked down at the lobby.  Sveta stood next to her, with Tristan off to one side.“Is Weld getting a statue?” Tristan asked.“Not for a while,” Sveta said.  “That’s more for people who’ve put in the years, and he only just got in.  He’s got a preliminary thing in the gift shop.”“No shit?  Awesome.  We should stop in at the gift shop before we leave.”“You’re such a kid,” Kenzie said, sticking out her tongue at Tristan.  He reached out to muss up her hair and she ducked back out of the way.“Victoria, was it?” the person at the desk asked.“Yes,” I said.“Your mother says you can go up.  She’s at Legal on the third floor.  She’ll take her break when you arrive, so you’ll have about fifteen minutes.”I resisted the urge to wince.  Fifteen minutes was too much.  Still, saying that would cause problems.  “Great.”“Give me five seconds, and I’ll give you your guest ID cards.  Can your friends come to the desk?”We lined up in front of the desk.  The printer didn’t take long, spitting out four cards in four seconds.“Check your names are accurate, please, and- there seems to be a problem with miss… Kenzie?”He turned the card around.  A slash of distortion masked Kenzie’s face, tracing from her cheekbone to one corner of her forehead.  It looked like the heavy compression artifacting that came with any image that had been compressed too many times, but it was dense to the point that her eyes, nose, and cheekbone were almost completely covered.“Do you want to try again?” Kenzie asked.  She had her phone in her hand as she clasped her hands behind her back.  I saw the screen momentarily light up.The man tapped at the keyboard for a few seconds, then turned around to grab the card as the machine spat it out.  He gave a singular nod and passed the card with its attached lanyard to Kenzie.  Picture normal.We headed for the stairs up to the third floor.“I didn’t know they were going to take our photos,” Kenzie said.“What are you even doing, obscuring your face like that?” Tristan asked.“It’s not on purpose, obviously, it’s a byproduct of tech I’m wearing.”Once we reached the third floor, there was less in the way of civilian-facing offices, and there were more people in suits and business clothes.  The glass wall had letters applied to it.  Just ‘303 – LEGAL’.My mom had had a study back at our house, with the hundred or so legal tomes with all of the case history, precedent, and whatever else, on top of the books we’d fashioned ourselves, binding in a variety of ways, saving team stuff, parahuman case files we’d printed off the net, and more.This was that, it was the same kind of heavy oak desks that my mom had had in her study, the shelves, the desk lamps and the scattered paperwork that had yet to be gathered together and bound.  It was files and filing cabinets, a storm of legality as if a giant had sneezed in a legal office.My mom might have been one of the older people around.  A lot of the lawyers looked young, and at two in the afternoon, jackets were off and slung on the backs of chairs, sleeves were rolled up and perfect hairstyles were just a little bit messed up.  She was doing a lot of the talking, taking charge and getting people organized.A young lady approached us at the doorway.  “If you’re wanting to lay charges against the Wardens, or if you have witness testimony to give, you’ll want to go to Casework on the second floor.  I know it’s confusing.”“My mom is Carol Dallon, I’m just stopping in to ask a question.  The people at check-in said it was okay.”“Oh wow, yeah, look at you.  I definitely see the resemblance.  Your mom is awesome, you know.”“I know,” I said, my eyebrows going up momentarily.The lady stepped away to fetch my mom.The feeling of trepidation got worse as I watched my mom walk toward me.  It was hard to divorce this scene and image with my memory of being on the street outside my mom’s house, the hurt and the feelings there.My mom smiled, acknowledging the other three.  “Victoria.  This is a pleasant surprise.”“I  had a conversation with dad last night.  He suggested that you might be the person to ask for this thing these guys are doing.”“Ah,” my mom said.  She barely seemed fazed by that.  “Just business?”“More or less,” I said.Man, I was still so pissed at her.  I was more pissed somehow that she was being nice and casual.“I’m happy to help however you need it,” she said.  “The only issue is I can’t step away right this minute.  We’re waiting on a phone call from some people in the would-be government, and my coworker is away on a late lunch.”“I don’t need you to step away,” I said.  “These guys are starting up a team.  Dad suggested they’d do best if they had someone legal to call up before any big moves.  Make sure charges stick.”My mom looked over at the three.  Kenzie put her hand up in a small wave.“Is that Sveta?”“Hi, Mrs. Dallon.”“I didn’t recognize you at first.  I can’t believe it,” my mom said.  She approached Sveta, taking Sveta’s hands and lifting them up.  “What beautiful work.”“I’m pleased with it,” Sveta said, ducking her head a bit.“And the art- is this yours?  It reminds me of what I saw you working on during one of my visits.”“It’s mine.”“It’s stellar,” my mom said.“I don’t suppose you’d know someone you could put us in touch with?” I asked, more tense than I’d wanted to sound.“I can ask around.  Are you paying them?”“I think we’d have to,” I said.“We’re pretty overloaded right now.  I can’t make promises.”“I don’t think the team has any major moves planned for early in their career,” I said.  “Having someone available a month from now or two months from now might be good.”“I’ll see what I can do, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we’re still moving at this clip two months from now.”“What do you do?” Tristan asked.“We’re lobbying on behalf of the Wardens.  The government is figuring out the law as we speak, and we’re trying to figure out the most effective approach to handle law and parahumans and how they interact in the new world.  A lot of precedent, citing past history, pulling from the law of Earth Bet.”“It sounds heavy,” Tristan said.“We’re deciding the legal fabric of the new world.  It is,” my mom said.“Can you sound some people out?” I asked.  “Having someone we could trust to be discreet would be ideal.  It wouldn’t be heavy.”“I’ll ask around.  I know we’ve got a few ex-law students who are in limbo,” my mom said.  She gave me a look.  “They could use the extra funds, and they should have enough knowledge of the system as it stands.  They’re even on the ground floor for the legal system we may end up with, if we’re successful here.”“Thank you,” I said.  “We’ll discuss and I’ll look at the books, and we’ll see if we can pay them something fair.”Keep it business.“Would you come to dinner tonight?” she asked.  “We can talk.  If I have a better idea of what you’re doing, I can find you a better fit.”“I’d really rather not,” I said.“Communication is key.  We should talk.”“Another time,” I said.  Weeks or months from now.“Okay,” she said.  “I’d like to invite your sister to a sit-down.”My dignity and grace were dashed away, just like that.  A startling, painful jar from reality to somewhere else.  The lights of the brightly lit legal office seemed too bright and the dark shadows and the dimly lit building interior of the Wardens HQ and its lobby seemed too dark.It was very, very hard, in the moment, to separate my recollection of being outside the house with her inside that house, from this, and to convince myself that she wasn’t here, somewhere nearby.“Nah,” I said.  My voice too soft.“Victoria-”“Mom,” I said, my voice sharp.  “Do you want this conversation to go in the same direction as the one at the barbecue?”“That’s up to you,” she said.I thought about saying something regrettable.“Bye mom.  Good luck with your thing.”She looked like she might say something, but she smiled instead, and said, “Good luck with yours.”I turned to go, and the others followed.We walked a little way around the circumference of the floor, between the offices to our right and the railing to our left, until we were a distance away from the legal department.  I leaned on the railing, and wrapped one of my hands around the other, squeezing it.Sveta put an arm around me, and then Kenzie walked up to the other side of me and put a hand on my back.“I’m okay,” I said.There wasn’t an immediate response.“She was never my favorite person,” Sveta said.“You seemed to get along with her before.”Sveta shook her head, hair flying out a little ways.  “You were always really down when she was due to visit, and you were down when she missed visits.  And you were down after she came.”“I was down all the time.”“It was different kinds.”“Family’s hard,” Tristan said.  “It really sucks sometimes.”“Yeah,” Kenzie said.  “Family can be the best and it can be the worst.”Sveta let her arm slide off my shoulder.  It settled on Kenzie’s head with a faint clack.“Ow,” Kenzie said.Sveta’s fingers lifted up, then came down, in a pat.I stood straighter, and Sveta moved a bit away, her arm reeling in, giving me freedom to stand back.  “Hopefully this gets you guys one step closer to being a team with everything you need.  We should go talk to Foresight and see if we can get you the rest of the way.”“What’re we talking about with Foresight?”“Jurisdiction,” I said.  “There might be a few other pieces of ground to cover, finances, selling info.”“Sounds good,” he said.  “You up to talking about the kind of info you can gather, Kenz?”“I think so.”The fifth floor wasn’t built around a hole in the floor like the bottom four were.  There wasn’t a view of the lobby, a railing, or anything of the sort.  Another security checkpoint was set up at the base of the stairs.  With our lanyards and guest IDs, we were clear to go.  Our arrival was preceded by a shift in lights visible from the stairwell.Masks on.The floor plan was closer to a proper office building, with hallways studded with posters and pictures of team members and leaders, teams, and framed news articles.  The hallway to the right of us had ‘SHEPHERDS’ and a shepherd’s crook running down the length of it, a burgundy stripe of paint lit up by lights on the underside of the crook.  Red-brown colors to the wall, and the articles and pictures were all for the Shepherds.In the hallway to our left, Foresight, blue and black paint and lights, Foresight members and victories on the wall opposite.A door opened and a few Shepherds stepped out into the hall.“Holy shit,” one said.“Fuck,” Tristan said, under his breath.It was the moon girl, from my job interview with Attendant.  She was the one who had urged me away from the Fallen.  I was hardly enthused to see her either.“Tristan,” she said.  “Tell me you’re not interviewing for a team.”“I’m not,” he said.  “I’ve got the team already.”She pursed her lips together.“History, Moonsong?” someone asked.“Yeah,” Moonsong said.  “Tribute knows.”“Yeah,” the guy who was apparently ‘Tribute’ said.  He wore what looked like a hypermodernized version of the suit of armor with the cape over one shoulder.  It wasn’t old fashioned armor, though.  It was panels on a bodysuit, and the cape was cut to cling close to his body, angular for flowing cloth, with glowing lines where the sharp angles were.  “History is putting it lightly.”“We’re late for an appointment,” Tristan said.“You’re the guys who are talking to Foresight,” someone else said.  “They mentioned something like that.”“Yeah,” I said.  Then, aware of the opening in the conversation, I elaborated with, “Hello again, Moonsong.”“Hello,” she said.  “What was your name again?”“Victoria.”“You seemed cool, Victoria.  What are you doing with this bastard?”“Wow,” Tristan said.“Just helping out,” I said.“He doesn’t need it, and he doesn’t deserve it.”“Whatever’s in the past, he gets his second chance, like anyone.  He wants to help people, and I’m going to help him do that.”“He’s one of the monsters you help save people from,” Moonsong said.  “You get that, right?”“That’s not fair,” Kenzie said.She stopped as Tristan put one hand out in front of her, keeping her from jumping forward in his defense.“Tribute and I arrested him,” Moonsong said.  “You know that, right?”I could see the lines in Tristan’s jaw standing out.  He said, “I know.  I remember.”“I want to see Byron,” Moonsong said.“Not your call.  His turn isn’t until later.”There was a shudder, and then my hair started to move.    The light further down the hallway seemed to grow darker, and my stomach lurched in a sensation that I connected to a lot of aerial acrobatics.“You want to pick a fight here?” Tristan asked.Tribute shifted his footing, stepping forward a little, and clasped his hands in front of his groin.  With his head bowed slightly, he was faintly reminiscent of the Wardens’ emblem.I stepped forward, ready to put myself between them, and I felt the stomach-lurching sensation again.  My leg buckled, and I nearly fell.My hair was floating now, and my legs were straining, almost locked in position with the stress of keeping me upright.Gravity manipulation, but somehow a mix of zero-grav and enhanced gravity.I flew instead of walking, and it was hard to keep my position.  I stopped when I was between Tristan and the other two.  “This isn’t helpful.”“Victoria,” Moonsong said.  “I’m going to tell you how this goes.”I felt the gravity shift again, an attempt to put me down against the floor, and threw up my forcefield to avoid twisting my ankle or hitting the ground too hard.  I was glad my skirt wasn’t the kind that could flip up, as it hugged my thighs, but my midriff was exposed now.“Tristan joins the team, and he charms the pants off of everyone he meets.  He’s good at the stuff he does in front of the camera, he’s good at the hero stuff, he’s strong.  He gets decent grades, he makes friends, he finds allies and he works on them.  Because that’s what sociopaths do.  He doesn’t actually care about them.”“Sociopath?” Tristan asked.  “You’re as deluded as ever.”“He jokes and acts all cute about how he’s competitive, he likes to win, and he tends to win so you don’t really see how sore of a loser he is when things go bad.  He sets his sights on something he wants, he gets it.  Sets his sights on something else, he gets it.  Until he doesn’t get what he wants.  Like being team leader or getting a key role in an event that’s coming up.  That’s when he starts using the people he’s been working on.  They’re usually desperate people.  Vulnerable ones.”I thought of Rain, who Tristan had called a friend.  Or did the whole team count?“It’s called leaning on people when you’re struggling.”“It’s called manipulation.  And you’re good at it,” Tribute said.“Fuck off,” Tristan said.  “Drop the power use and let us go.  We’ve got things to do.”“Moonsong,” Sveta said.  “I don’t think you know Tristan as well as you think.”“Same,” Moonsong said.  “I feel really sorry for you if he’s already got into your good graces.  Because that bastard is the kind of guy who hires someone who kills people by looking at them to cover his ass, and uses them against teammates.  He likes to win and he wins at any cost.”“We know the story,” Sveta said.“I doubt you know the entirety of it.  Have you split the discussion fifty-fifty between listening to him and Byron?”  Moonsong asked.  She didn’t even wait for a response before deciding, “No.  Because it doesn’t work that way.”“I gave Byron the opportunity,” Tristan said.“Yeah,” Moonsong said.  “I know how that goes.  Like with Team Reach’s therapist, right?  You get your turn, Byron gets his, you go in for extra advice, you take over, and somehow the team’s therapist gets weird ideas in his head about Byron.  You suggest things and then when Byron gets his turn he’s having to play defense, get rid of these preconceived ideas.  He gets no time of his own with the therapist, because he’s stuck trying to undo the damage Tristan did during his time.”“All I did,” Tristan said, lines standing out as his neck, “Was try to figure shit out.  There’s a lot to figure out with the situation being what it is, and somehow I end up doing the legwork.”“It’s a lot of work to manipulate everyone around you, isn’t it?” Moonsong asked.“Stop,” I said.  “Stop this.  Now.”I pushed out with a faint hit of aura.“Please,” Sveta said, adding her voice to mine.“I want to hear that Byron is okay, from Byron’s mouth.  I don’t give a shit about Tristan’s time.”“Fuck this,” Tristan said.  “Fine.”He blurred, his eyes becoming crimson points, then transitioning to become teal.Byron, wearing a sweatshirt and jeans.The gravity effect dropped away.“Hi Byron,” Kenzie said, her voice small.“Hi Kenzie.”“You okay?” Moonsong asked.“I’ve had better weeks, but things with my brother are as tolerable as they get,” Byron said.  He slouched, sticking his hands in the pocket of the sweatshirt.  “You kind of went overboard.”“I had to check.”“I know,” Byron said.There was a noise behind us, and I turned to look.Foresight.  Anelace and someone I hadn’t met.“Why don’t you come on in?  Step into the office,” Anelace asked.  “Moonsong?  Can I have a word?”Foresight’s administrative office wasn’t the same office I’d been in when I’d interviewed with them.  Their headquarters was situated elsewhere, and this was something else, a space set up for meetings, for paperwork, interactions with other teams and more.  Much like the hallways had, it looked like an office.Right away, Moonsong, Tribute, and the member of Foresight stepped into an office, closing the doors.  The blinds were at an angle where I could see where they stood, but not their expressions or what they might be saying.Anelace stepped into the back, then came back to the sitting area.  He looked at us, then at the other members of Moonsong’s group.  “Come on.  Let’s keep everyone separate until things are settled.”Our group walked into a back room, a single table and some nice chairs in a room with a coffee maker and microwave.“I was looking forward to seeing you again, Victoria,” Anelace said.  “Sorry it’s not under better circumstances.”“Yeah,” I said.“I’m going to go talk to the others.  There won’t be a problem if I leave you guys here?”“Not at all,” I said.Anelace left us in the room.  Kenzie flopped forward, forehead hitting the table, arms extended all the way in front of her.Byron changed back to Tristan.“No,” Tristan said, quiet.  “So long as I’m here, Moonsong is going to be frothing at the mouth.  I’m trading out until she’s good and gone.”They swapped back.  Byron slouched into his seat.“I didn’t know that about the therapy, Byron,” Sveta said.Byron shrugged.“It’s why you don’t want to sit in for Mrs. Yamada’s?”“It’s part of it,” he said.  “Look, I don’t want to demonize Tristan or anything, like Moon is so good at doing.  He has his good side, but a lot of the time, I’ve got to conserve my strength for dealing with the rougher patches.  Minor, basic stuff.”“Do you think he’s a sociopath?” I asked.“No,” Byron said.  “But I think… he’s got to be the worst possible person to end up sharing a body with.”“Is there anything I or we can do to make it easier?” I asked.“I’m working on a camera that looks inside Tristan to find Byron, or vice-versa,” Kenzie said, without raising her head.  “It’s not going so well but I’m going to figure it out.”“Thanks Kenz.  No, nothing makes it easier.  You can… tackle the broad strokes, you can be careful not to talk past my face to say something to Tristan and never do the opposite when Tristan’s the one in front.  It doesn’t make a difference with the stuff that really matters.  That’s my stuff to deal with.”“What stuff?” I asked.“He’s… stubborn, destructively stubborn, he holds this idea of what should happen in his head, and if that doesn’t work for you then you’re probably going to be pretty unhappy, because you aren’t going to change anything about it.”“Reminds me a bit of my mom when you describe it that way,” I said.“Yeah, but you can walk away from your mom, can’t you?” Byron asked.“Yeah,” I said.  I sighed.“I really appreciate that sigh.  Maybe you get it,” he said, leaning his head back until it rested against the wall, his face turned skyward.  “He thrives on competition, you know.  He’ll be a terrific hero, probably.  Put a challenge in front of him, and he’ll give his all to kick its ass.”“But?” I asked.“That’s him.  That’s who he is, intrinsically.  I don’t know if there’s a but.  It’s reality, and it’s reality that I’m the challenge and he’s energized when it comes to the tug of war over this one body we share.  He thrives on it in a way, and I’m… drained, beaten down.”“We have your back,” Sveta said.  “Not just Tristan’s.  We’re backing Capricorn, and we’re invested in finding answers for both of you.”“I appreciate that.  But I don’t like this.  At best, it’s… more draining.  More of me being beaten down and left more exhausted.  At worst… Moonsong might be right.”“At best,” I said, “It’s Tristan doing what he’s good at doing.  What happens if he doesn’t have that outlet?”I didn’t get a response.There was a knock on the door.  Anelace, the dagger-themed member of Foresight.“Can you join us?” he asked.We migrated from the team’s lunch room to the office where the team leader, Moonsong and Tribute were seated.The leader stood by his desk, one foot on his chair.  He looked larger of frame, and had Foresight’s symbol on an eye patch.  A bit of a corsair look, with a jacket and lots of belts, and long black hair tied back into a sailor’s ponytail.  Veins of gold decorated his costume.“Sorry for the hassle,” Tribute said.  “History.  Things never really resolved so much as we all walked away with the situation left halfway through a disaster.”“It’s alright,” I said.“We’ve been having a conversation with the Shepherds,” the leader of Foresight said.  “They’ve explained some of the history.  It muddies the waters.”“We understand,” Sveta said.  “Sorry about this.”“They had the suggestion that we make sure both of the Capricorn twins are on board with this plan of yours.”“Why’d you have to drag me into this, Moonsong?  This doesn’t help.  I don’t want to own any part of this, whatever they do.”“I will always fight to give you your voice.”“I don’t want to speak,” Byron said.  “I want to ignore this side of my reality and conserve my strength for the fights that need it.”“Is that a no, then?” the leader of Foresight asked.“No,” Byron said.  He seemed to flounder for a moment.  He looked at me.  “Fuck.”He didn’t break that eye contact with me as he said it.  My eyebrow went up.“Don’t let me get in the way of you giving these guys their chance,” Byron said.“You’re vouching for them?” the Foresight leader asked.“Yeah.”Byron punctuated the sentence by changing into Tristan.“I’m good with this,” Tristan said, shifting his posture to avoid looking at Moonsong.“Good,” the Foresight leader said.  “Thank you for your time, Shepherds.”Tribute and Moonsong left the office.  Just Anlace, the leader, Kenzie, Byron, Sveta and I, now.I looked around the office and saw an article.  The leader was on the cover, with the name ‘Brio’.“You really want to do this?” Brio asked.“They’re suited for it,” I said.  “They have the ability to gather the information and figure out how to crack the toughest nuts.  Tinker devices and people on the ground who won’t get a second look hanging around Hollow Point.  They get the info, they sell it to you guys, and if you want it, they work with you on the actual cracking of the nut.  Joint operation, or it can be solo, one way or the other.”“Are you participating?” he asked.“If I’m wanted, I’ll add my strength to theirs for the big plays.”“To be honest, there’s a lot about this that could work,” Brio said.  “When the Wardens gathered us all together, they assigned territories by lottery.  We’ve got other things we’re focusing on, and Hollow Point is in a bad way.”“If you’ll pay a modest fee, enough to cover their lawyer, buy the info, keep them supplied, they’ll bring you in for the actual arrests.  It’s a win for you guys, while these guys do the leg work.”“If it works,” Brio said.“Yeah,” I said.“We’re hard workers,” Kenzie said.  “We’re really good at what we do.”“I don’t doubt that,” Brio said.  His voice had a tone shift that suggested he was used to talking to kids in a certain context.  “You have a lot of hurdles.”“We’ve been doing our initial research,” Anelace said.  “Figuring out how we might fix Hollow Point.  They’re tied into some bigger-picture stuff.”“Tattletale,” I said.“Her on one end,” Anelace said.  “But she’s more the kind of person you have to deal with further down the road.  Once you scare them, they’ll call her.  They already called her once about us, and she reached out to try to convince us to leave the area alone.”“And?” I asked.“And we’re leaving it alone, or we were, until you sent your proposal,” Brio said.I nodded.  Not good to hear, but understandable.  I wondered what played into that decision.“On the front end, you’ve got some others to deal with.  You’ll have to get past them before you can even start on the project.”“Who?”“Speedrunners,” Anelace said.  He turned around, reached for a file, and put it on the desk, pushing it in our direction.“I know them,” I said.  I left the file for Sveta, Tristan and Kenzie to look at.“A couple of times a day, they use their time powers.  Sweep the area, search every nook and cranny.  You won’t be able to set up shop.”“That’d be Secondhand,” I said.“They use Final Hour to cover other business.  Even if you avoid being caught in the sweeps, you won’t be able to look or listen in if they’re conducting meetings in banked timestreams.”“And Last Minute is still with the group?” I asked.“Yes.”Fucking time manipulators.  “Something to work out in advance then.”“They’ve got two thinkers, Braindead and Birdbrain, working as a team.  You won’t be able to have undercover agents if they’re checking things.  You will be tracked and your agents will be thoroughly investigated.”More folders hit the table.“Powers complicate things, and they’ve got a lot of powers there,” Anelace said.“Bitter Pill, tinker,” Brio said.  “A lot of the people in Hollow Point are expected to partake, and that means truth serums, just to start with.”I looked at the other members of the group.“You really think you’re up for this?” Brio asked.“Just speaking for myself, I’m more excited to do this than I was before you started talking about what we’re up against,” Tristan said.“I already have some ideas,” Kenzie said.  “Not about the time guys, but I have ideas.”“We knock the time guys down first,” Tristan said.  “Without a question.  We’ll have to.  We can do this.”I looked at Sveta, who had been quiet.“I want to do this,” she said, meeting Brio’s eyes.“Then we’ll give you our files as starting points.  You guys own this if it ends up being a disaster, you keep us informed, and-”“In exchange,” I interrupted, “You guys give us access to your costume sourcing.”“I can do costumes,” Kenzie said.“Without battery lives?” I asked.“Oh.”“Give us access to your costume manufacturing. I know you have it and I know you’re branching out to share it.”Anelace and Brio exchanged a look.  Brio nodded.  “Okay.”“And you give us your blessing to operate in this territory,” I said.“I don’t know if I like what I saw earlier,” Brio said.  “Blessing might be a strong word.”“All parahumans have their issues,” I said.Brio seemed to consider for a moment.He extended his hand to shake.We shook it, each of us in turn.No name yet, costumes to be decided, codenames to be determined.But we were a team with a mission.  We were doing this.                                                                                           Glare – Interlude 3                                                                                        Dot moved slowly and carefully through the store.  She placed a hand on the floor for the added balance and weight distribution, then slid the hand left to right and back again, pushing it through a layer of dust that gathered and tumbled onto the back of her hand.She was glad for the fingerless glove she wore, because it let her feel the finer details while keeping it clean and warm.  The floor was cool and moist.  The exterior wall of the store was letting the rain in, and the rain traced a path through one portion of the store, cutting thin rivers through the dust.  Wet in places, dry in places, but persistently clammy and dirty.  Perpetually colorless.It was the lack of color that got to her the most.It was one of the big stores, where everything was gathered together into tall stacks and piles beneath and on metal racks.  The lights were fluorescent, and they flickered.  The buzzing sounds the lights made were more constant than the light.A menacing sound.  Menacing, glaring lights.It was safer to climb on the stacks of cardboard boxes than it was to walk on the floor or to make contact with the wood and metal of the shelves.She paused as she climbed to a higher shelf, figuring out how best to ascend while minimizing dangerous contact.  Finally, she decided to take a risk by grabbing a metal cross-bar, hauling herself up, and setting her feet on a series of plastic bottles in cardboard trays, stacked higher than a man was tall.She couldn’t read well, but she could recognize the labels.  Pills.  Vitamins, probably.  If these were here, then there might be better offerings close by.  She searched the nearby piles until she found cardboard boxes with cartoon characters on the front.  Pictures of cartoon character heads were beside not-cartoon images in shiny monocolor shapes.Dot opened a box, careful not to make noise, and fished inside.  A plastic bottle within, and inside the plastic bottle… a colorful assortment of gummy vitamins.She fished out the contents and pushed them into her mouth until she could barely close her jaw.  The artificial taste overpowered her nose and mouth.  Her eyes rolled back into her head with the effort of chewing.A loud noise made her freeze.The doors had been opened.  She heard loud footsteps.She climbed deeper into the stacks of vitamins, listening and watching.“Hellooooo!” the call was drawn out.  Dot tensed, listening as the greeting bounced around the building interior.Dot waited.“Anyone here!?”She waited, silent, peering through the gaps between the cardboard boxes and plastic bottles.Another voice could be heard saying, “Lights are on and nobody’s home?”“They could be out, or a group of refugees might have stopped in on their way to the portal.  They could have set up power and scavenged before leaving things behind for others.”Dot winced with every tromp of boot on tiled floor.  She could hear people rummaging, pulling down boxes and tearing into the contents.  Things fell to the ground.She changed locations, putting some distance between herself and them.  It didn’t help; their explorations meant they drew nearer to her as she lurked on a high shelf.“…names you can’t pronounce, grab that first.”“Why?  Preservatives?”“Preservatives, yep.  Keep a close eye out for the products with the wrong names.”“Wrong names?”“If it’s not called soap, but a ‘cleansing bar’ that means it’s so loaded with crud that they weren’t legally allowed to call it soap.  That shit is gold to us, because the chemicals in it mean it lasts.  If it lasts, it can be resold back home.”“Soap goes bad?”“It can.  I’d rather take the misnamed shit that lasts than take something more legit home and find out it went bad.”“Good point.”“We’ll teach you all the tricks.  It’s a good gig, believe me.”“Yeah.  Hey, are those fridges?”“Yeah.  I wouldn’t get your hopes up.  Power was probably out for months to a year before someone got this building back on line.”“You think they have ice cream?  Or those push-freezes?”“You don’t want ice cream, remember?  You want-”“Frozen dairy-like desserts or something.”“Now you get it.”Dot watched as the younger man jogged across the floor to what was almost certainly his imminent demise.  He opened the glass door to the fridge display and began picking his way through cardboard boxes.She could see the green lights appearing in the background of the display, flicking on one by one, apparently at random.The older man noticed, stopping in his tracks.“Jackson!” he screamed the word.The machine rammed through the wall.  Six feet tall, six feet wide, with two legs, it slammed past metal racks, past food in cardboard boxes, through the glass doors, through the metal that the doors were attached to, and into Jackson.Both legs broken.  From the way he hit the ground, his arm might have been broken too.One mechanical leg thrust out, then dragged Jackson back into the hole in the wall.  Another reached out and began depositing a thin white fluid on the bloodstain.Jackson’s mentor was running and the machine was just starting to clean up the blood when two more belatedly thrust their way out through the walls.  They paused where they were, seemed to decide what they were doing, and then used wheels on their underbellies to roll along the floor, the two forelimbs out and ready.Gaps appeared in the face of each machine as they drew closer.  Jackson’s mentor shouted to friends elsewhere in the building as he rounded a corner in the shelves and stacks.He made the mistake of grabbing onto a metal strut at the edge of one set of shelves.  The face of the strut moved, changing in angle, and jerked upward.  A machine had taken a blade and camouflaged it to look like the red-painted metal surface, and it managed to carve deep into Jackson’s mentor’s hand.  The machine that controlled the blade moved.  It wore a cardboard box.Dot made a mental note of that as she remained frozen, watching.The people were running, gathering together.  They narrowly evaded the machines, using corners and their small size to stay clear as the machines from the fridge wall careened down the wide aisles.It didn’t matter.  They were already dead.She could hear the gasps and shrieks.  Here and there, weapons were deployed.  Sprays of darts, more blades from innocuous surfaces, wire.The gasps became more numerous, the sounds strained, and the activity of the scavengers slowed.  The ones who realized what was happening didn’t have the words to report it to the others.Gas.  Invisible, odorless.  They gasped and used everything they had to try to draw air into their lungs, but the machines were putting something heavier than oxygen on the ground floor of the store.  Now they drowned.Dot had lost family to this very same thing.  She had seen how painful it was, and she had known how painful it was to watch someone she cared about die that way.She took her time picking through the boxes of vitamins, putting them in her bag.  It was nice that the gummy vitamins didn’t rattle.  She picked up other things as she navigated the shelves, including bandages and some random bottles.An explosion drew her attention.Someone in a costume.Another explosion, followed by two more, and one of the big machines from the fridge wall collapsed.Apparently alerted by one of the dying, the woman in costume climbed up onto the shelving units, to get to higher ground where there was air.  She threw a blue light out of her hand, and it detonated on impact with the next machine.Back at the fridges, some of the fridges and surrounding wall had already been reconstructed.  Two more of the large cube-shaped machines squeezed through the gaps in the wall that were still there, before getting their wheels under them and hurrying in the direction of the woman in costume.Dot moved closer to the ground to get a look.  It was important to know just how far gone this building was.The entire area behind the fridges was gone.  Green flashing lights, wires, computers and metal twisted into shapes that helped it to provide a framework.  Machines were working slowly and steadily to refine and develop things.In the opposite corner of the building, the hero climbed behind a stack of cans.  A spray of flechettes punctured the paper with no resistance- there was no tin to the cans, only the labels and the haphazardly perched tops.  The machines had already collected everything and then put things back so it looked like it hadn’t been touched.The heroine fell and hit the floor.  She had been darted, punctured across the face and shoulder.You die too, Dot observed.Against all odds, though, the heroine had managed to hold her breath.  She got to her feet and she ran.Dot climbed carefully, avoiding suspicious surfaces as she navigated the piles.  She kept one eye out for things she could use and one eye on the heroine.A box cutter, left on the surface by a past employee.  Useful.  Dot grabbed it.One of the machines shifted position.  Two legs on the ground in front of it, backside resting on the ground.  Its face opened wide, and a salvo of missiles fired forth.  Ten, twelve, metal canisters with streams of vapor painting the air in their wake as they flew in lazy arcs or even tumbled through the air before getting their bearings.However haphazard they looked, they didn’t hit anything they weren’t supposed to.  They traced courses between stacks of pasta and boxes of cereal, through the struts of metal shelves, and through the two-inch gaps between shelf and the floor below.The heroine shot at shelves, bringing down the contents in showers that might block the missiles.  Some missiles detonated.  Others navigated the falling debris, and the heroine shot at those next.Some missiles didn’t detonate, but they weren’t missiles in actuality.  They were tricks.The heroine backed up, then saw the two new arrivals, two more of the big ‘soldier’ machines.  She ran for the door.But the machines had had her since she had let them know she existed.The heroine made it to the door, and then a metal skewer harpooned her hand.Blow it up.  Lose the hand, Dot thought.  She realized she was rooting for the heroine despite herself.The heroine fought, and she’d had to stop running to fight.  More skewers impaled her forearm, then her other hand.She used her power, she shot at shelves, but she lacked the angle.  The machines reeled in, using the wires attached to the skewers, and the heroine was hauled into the air, arms out to either side, legs dangling.Dot sat, and she waited.  She ate more gummy multivitamins and she observed the machines.  She watched as the mess was slowly cleaned up, boxes pulled back into position, products lined up, and sections of floor that had been shattered by missiles were fit together like jigsaw pieces.Here and there, deep in the craters and crevices, the ‘trick’ missiles had delivered payloads that weren’t explosive.  They looked like veins of metal in rock.  In weeks and months, they would ‘hatch’, revealing the machinery that had built itself within.  For now, they were paved over.  Smaller machines filled in cracks with something white that would harden, with daubs of black for the speckles in the tile.  A blade scraped away the excess, and a small nozzle provided a covering of dust to match surrounding floor.A close eye would notice where the floor was different, but it would have to be close and careful.The machines weren’t too challenging to destroy.  Dot’s groups had sometimes destroyed them.  The trick was that they set in roots wherever they went.  Each time they reached a new place, they would keep emerging from that place, from walls and floor and rock and tree.  It took care and attention to get the machine out of each of those things, and while that care was being taken, machines elsewhere would emerge, march, and make inroads along the flanks.Green lights here and there went dark, the machines hibernating.  Dot deemed herself safe to move.She stuck to the high ground, while the still-active machines continued their work below.  She eased herself closer to the heroine, and paused, observing.  Here and there, the woman kicked or struggled, and the machines didn’t respond.  Blood streamed down and dripped from her toes to her floor.  Each time blood accumulated enough to drip and make a small splash on the floor, a machine zoomed out to spray at it and then wiped it away before returning to its hiding place beneath a shelf.Dot leaped.  She landed on the woman’s shoulder, and the woman’s face twisted, contorting into a wordless scream at the sudden, added weight on her injured arms and hands.Then the woman looked at Dot, and her expression changed again.  Fear, alarm.Dot was small, only about as large as the woman’s head, and she was colorful.  Her clothes had been stolen from dolls and pieced together with diligent care.  Her tail with its fur tuft on the end swished with the box-cutter it held..“Help me.”Dot shook her head.“I have people who are counting on me.  I have a sick sibling, they need me to bring in the money from this work.”“I have people too,” Dot whispered.  She stuck her tongue up to pick her nose, then drew it back into her mouth.  “Some sick too.”The heroine made a small sound, bowing her head.  “I’ll help you, I’ll- I’ll convince people to give you medical care.  We can trade.”Dot reached out with one hand, and she pushed the tab that extended the blade from the box-cutter.“I’ll do anything,” the heroine said.Dot paused.“Anything,” the heroine said, seizing on the pause.“My king,” Dot said.  “Where?”“Your king?”“Yes.”“I can take you.”“No you can’t,” Dot said.  She hugged the box cutter against her chest with two spotted arms, red spots on yellow-white flesh.  “You die here.  I’m not big or strong.  Machines are.  If I go for help then you dead before I’m back.”“Please.”“Tell me where my king is and I’ll be fast.  Merciful.”“I don’t- this isn’t about me.  Can you- can you let them know the Machine Army is this far north?  They shouldn’t be on this side of the Raleigh chasm.”“They kill me on sight.”“Find a way?  Please?  I’ll tell you where your king is, I help you, but you need to tell them.  We need the Wardens to stop them before they get their roots in.”Too late, Dot thought to herself.The woman seemed to take it as assent, when it wasn’t.  “The Wardens’ headquarters, probably.  It’s- it’s on Gimel, where a lot of the trains go.  The train nearest here goes there.  You’ll want to look for a building with a statue of a knight with a sword at the front.”Dot took a two-handed grip on her box cutter.“Tell the Wardens.  Let them know, so they can take measures.  Tell them Burnish said it.  It might save your King’s life.”Dot paused.“Yes,” she said.Then she cut into the woman’s throat, until blood sprayed from the artery.  She opened her mouth wide, until the teeth on the upper half of her mouth pointed in the same direction as the teeth on the lower jaw, and bit in deep, locking her mouth in place.  She swallowed the blood, gorging herself.Vitamins, protein, nourishment.  She would fill herself here, then visit her brothers and sisters.  Then she would set out on her quest.A distance below them, machines washed away the blood.  After the heroine had been kept up and out of the way long enough to ensure her power wouldn’t be a problem, she would be cleaned up too.Dot felt energized, her focus as sharp as the box-cutter.  She knew where their king was.King Rinke.  Nilbog.⊙She clung to the underside of the train.  The ground was a blur beneath her, periodically studded with rocks and branches.Those of her kind who ventured into the human’s civilization didn’t tend to return.  She knew it was a risk.  She knew she had a one percent chance when it came to this.  She’d said her goodbyes accordingly.Blackspot would be left in charge.  He’d been unwell lately, and he might be too unwell to lead their group.  He was thirteen and that made him old, and after their discussion, her communicating in broken English and gesture and him communicating in chirp, he’d agreed.  She suspected he’d made the decision because he hoped she would bring their king back somehow.  It was Blackspot’s only chance at being recycled and made into new life.Lump would be second in command.  Lump had been injured a year ago, after running into humans.  He barely moved now.  When he died, the group would be more free to move, but they wouldn’t leave him behind until then.Lump was one of the only big ones that were left.Dot used her tail to fish out a gummy vitamin from inside her tunic where it sat close to her belly.  It stuck to her skin and had to be peeled away.  She chewed it slowly and carefully.She was thirsty.  She hadn’t anticipated how dehydrated she would get.  The chewing got her saliva flowing, though some unfortunately flowed out through the corners of her wide mouth.There was a hole that smelled like shit, leading into the train interior, but she didn’t want to climb up into there.  Shit didn’t bother her, but the smell would hurt her ability to stay undetected.She was a scout and a spy, a messenger to a king in captivity.She would endure.  She clung to the bolts and bars, arching her back when she saw a branch or rock that might scrape at her, and she chewed.The train slowed.  She shifted her position, ears reorienting to catch more sound.  Every detail she could pick up would matter, now.  She was in hostile territory.The train rolled to a stop.  Doors hissed as they opened, and the crowd began to make their way out.  Dot peered between the wheels and up, to see the refugees and the scavengers, as well as the men and women and boys and girls in uniforms who came and went.She dropped to the tracks, and she moved to the dark corner, crawling through the dust and grime to help cover up the color of her spots and outfit.Too many for her to slip across the platform.  Would she have an opening?  She crept along, looking for vents, for cracks, or anything where she could slip through.Too new a building, too maintained.  This was nothing like the kingdom or the ruins she had known during her five years of existence.The only time she had seen this many humans was when their kingdom had been invaded.  She had been aware as each set of humans boarded at different stops, but for all of them to get off here, for there to be no more tracks?  This had to be the end.  Their destination and hers.She trembled with anticipation as the stream of people from the train slowed.Boots were more serious than shoes.  Matching boots were most serious.  She associated matching boots with the men with guns that worked with the people in costume.  When men with matching boots and people in costume got together, it was often to kill her kind.She would save her king.She crept along the underside of the ledge, where the platform jutted toward the train.  When the train left, would she be exposed?She would do anything for her king.Her weapon was ready.  The box cutter.  It still smelled like the blood of the heroine.  Of Burnish.Thinking of the blood made her think again about how thirsty she was.“Christ,” one of the boots said.  “Incoming.”Someone else groaned.“Good afternoon,” a woman said.“Afternoon,” was the curt response.“You’ve got a thtowaway.”Dot froze.“A thtowaway?” was the response.  There was a sound of an impact, light.“Thomething thmall.”“Is this like when you had us stop the train, put the entire city on hold, made us get the bomb disposal bot under the train with a camera, all to show us some squirrel roadkill caught in the machinery?”“I’m here for a reathon.  Thith ith what I do.”“Every time you jerk our chains you lose trust, and you’ve jerked our chains a lot.  You haven’t done much to regain that lost trust.”“I wouldn’t jerk your chain, Adam,” the woman said.  “I thpecialithe in noticing thmall thingth, and I know how thmall and thort your chain is.”There was laughter.Dot wondered if she had any options.  There hadn’t been anything she could use to disguise herself as roadkill.  What would she do if the train started moving?“Can you actually see short, uh, chains?” another woman asked.“No comment.”“I think we have a camera we can drop to the track.  It should be up at the station proper.  We can do a quick search.  You want to grab it, Adam?”“Yeah, sure.”“I’ll make a call, ask them to keep the train put while we search.  Stay close, Rat?”“The name’th Ratcatcher.  I’ll thtay clothe.”Dot made her way along the car, until she found one of the holes near the shit-hole.  This hole didn’t lead up into the car, there was a grate barring her way, catching hair and other gunk, but it was just wide enough for her to squeeze most of the way into.She waited, listening, until she heard the clatter.Her role in the community had been a scout, to start with.  She had ended up a leader after a while, but she was still a scout at heart.  Exploring new places, figuring out ways to deal with traps, with the enemies that lurked out there.She had dealt with the Machine Army.  This little toy wouldn’t stop her.With clawed toes and the opposable toe on her foot, she clawed some of the hair out of the drain.Patience.  Care.  Machines were predictable, once they had revealed their tricks.  The challenge was to find the tricks without being discovered or caught.She watched as the machine passed under her.  Dropping from her hiding place, almost noiseless, she landed right behind it.  She used all of her strength to tip it over, then wrapped the hair around the wheel and reached up, tying it to a bit of metal at the base of the hole, where a passing rock or branch had made the metal rougher.Snagged, caught, but in a believable way.She darted away, as voices commented on the situation, trying to riddle out what had happened.  A human dropped down between the platform and the train itself, ducking low to peer between wheels, looking for the little camera drone.The platforms were mostly empty, and most of the watchful eyes were focused on the little drone and the issue.She stuck her head up, ears low and close to her body, tail swishing beneath her, and then made a break for a vent.A human moved, making a run for her.  Shoes slid on the smooth floor of the station platform as the human put herself between Dot and the vent.“Not so fatht,” the woman said, as Dot skidded on the floor, stopping.The woman was small, as humans went, and she wore a costume that covered most of her body.  Her mask was roughly cone-shaped, but the paper or wire that kept the mask pointy had been dented or damaged at one point, and the nose drooped a bit.  Rodent-like, with ears sticking out and back at the side, flat against the side of her head.  The eyes behind the eye-holes were large, dark, and moist.  If Dot unfocused her eyes a bit, it looked like there was nothing behind the eyeholes.  Dark hair draped around in front of the ears and down the back of the woman’s head.  As pointy as the mask was, she wore a hood or a hat with a point going the opposite direction.She wore a jacket, denim, with a threadbare collar, a striped shirt beneath, and a thin chain belt with mousetraps dangling from it.  Her socks were striped as well, extending high enough that they just barely met her denim cut-off shorts.Dot was willing to admit that if she was going to die, at least it was at the hands of someone with a good aesthetic.“You thall not path,” Ratcatcher said.Dot remained where she was, frozen.“Can you talk?” Ratcatcher asked.“Yes,” Dot said.“I like your colorth.”Dot stretched out her hands in front of her, looking at her arms.“I bet you’re beautiful when clean,” Ratcatcher said.“Yes,” Dot said.  She was.  She wasn’t interesting looking, but she could talk and she could use her hands, feet, and tail, well, and she had some pretty patterns: her namesake spots.“I want you to go home,” Ratcatcher said.  “If we fight, I’ll win.  I thpecialize in dealing with your type.”“I’m here to deliver message,” Dot said.  “That all.”“What methage?”“Burnish.  She went to a store.  Machine Army was there.  She wanted me to tell.  North of the Raleigh chasm.  They were surprised.”“We thought it was your people,” Ratcatcher said.“No,” Dot said.  “I watched.”“You didn’t help?”“Too small, too weak.”“That’th no ekthuthe.  Burnith was a good one.  Nice to me.  I’ll mith her.”Dot remained where she was.  She looked back.  No sign that the men who were investigating under the train even realized she wasn’t there anymore.“Thank you for your methage.”“I’ll go now,” Dot said.  “But can I have water?  I’m so thirsty.”“Come.  Vending machine.  Have you theen thethe?”Dot had, but she shook her head.Ratcatcher held out a hand.  Dot was wary, but she ventured closer.“Thay hello to Raththputin,” Ratcatcher said.  “Thtay in my pocket for now.”In another time, another world, Dot might have stayed.But she had a king to rescue.  A king adored by his people.  A truly great man.As Ratcatcher reached into a pocket, change jingling, Dot saw opportunity.  She leaped for the ground, went under the vending machine, and then ran along the wall, darting for the vent.Big people were often slow.  Ratcatcher wasn’t.  Fast reflexes.  Fast in general.But Dot was faster.  Had the vent not already had a corner peeled away, Dot wouldn’t have been able to make it inside.  As it was, she ducked inside, and Ratcatcher’s gloved fingers only managed to seize the ends of the hairs at the end of Dot’s tail.  Dot hauled herself free.Ratcatcher moved her mask aside, fingers going to her mouth, and then whistled.  “Trouble!”But Dot was already in her element.She ran through dusty vents, navigating the guts of the building.  Flashlights periodically shone into the vents, illuminating areas.  She avoided most of those beams of lights, going this way and that, until she found another convenient point, where two pieces of metal weren’t flush together.  She squeezed through and pulled her bag after her.It was another minute until she realized two things.Ratcatcher had friends.The convenient openings in the vents and leading from vent to the inside of the walls of the station were there because of those friends.Dot had dealt with rats before, but these rats were the sort that were very ugly and very large.  In the right light, they might have been mistaken for very ugly, small dogs.  Dot had always liked that story when the King read it from the scary children’s book.  The children got the dog and the dog turned out to be a Mexican sewer rat.These rats were that sort, apparently, and they smelled like Ratcatcher’s pocket had.She drew her box-cutter, extending the blade, and sized up her opponents.Three rats against her and her boxcutter.It might have been an even fight, but she had her devotion to her king on her side.She would rescue her king.⊙The building that held her king was fitting for the stories.  The statue lacked color, but it had the right atmosphere.  She was bleeding but she told herself that this was how things were in those stories.  The heroine at the foot of the castle of the evil empire, the king in captivity.  She hurt from the battles already fought and faced the greatest challenge yet.Getting inside wasn’t hard, but getting up was.  The vents were barred and had cameras, and people were already on guard when she arrived, keeping a close eye on those same vents.She could only wait.Patience was essential to a scout.  The fact that every inch of her hurt from her fight with the sewer rats made the patience a little different.  She had been hurt before, and she had been hurt in a way that made each breath an effort.Breathe in, breathe out.  If she did that once, she was one step closer to being better and being okay.  She knew it was a long journey, but surviving was important.Surviving was especially important now.He was close.She would free him, and he would usher in a new age of greatness for her and her people.  She might even have a place at his side, where she could be close to him at all times.She wasn’t even sure what that would be like.  She had been ecstatic when she had seen mere glimpses of him, back in the old Kingdom.Breathe in, hurt, breathe out, hurt again, feel the scratches and the bites when she shifted position.  Breathe in, breathe out, double check she wasn’t anywhere she might be found.She licked at her wounds, and she licked at the dust and grit, so her colors would be bolder.  She licked her hands and ran wet hands over her hair, smoothing it.She had arrived early in the morning, on the train, and now she waited until the sun was high in the sky.  Each breath was a step closer to wellness and moving again.She dug in her small pack for the bandages.  They were the small kind, with sticky sides.  She had brought the colorful ones with cartoons on them for luck, and now she placed them over her wounds, along with little bits of cotton and fabric to soak up the blood.It seemed like there were more people who came and went than there were stars in the sky, but her senses might have been playing tricks on her.The trickle of people slowed.  When some made early returns, they smelled like food.  Midday meals, then.  She waited until everyone was back and working, sluggish from the food in their bellies, and then she made her move.Up the underside of the stairs to the second floor.  Into a crack between a booth and the wall.  Up to the third floor, in a similar way.There was security guarding the way from the fourth floor to the fifth.  A commotion gave her a chance to slip through.  It helped that she was small and it helped more that she was experienced.Now she explored.  The fifth floor didn’t seem much like a prison.  The sixth was closer, with more security, more computers, more monitors.She heard a voice, and she caught a familiar name.“…Rinke.”“I don’t see the point.  He’s a broken man.”Dot clutched at her chest, just over her heart.“He’s a great man.  Him being broken or not broken doesn’t change that.”“I don’t see the point, Riley.  I don’t think I’d gain anything, and I don’t think the people I care the most about would be very happy about me hanging around with him.”“You hang around with me.”“Someone has to check your work.”“Whatever.  I’m going to go talk to him.  I think you should join us.  You can check my work after, we’ll make it fast.”The pair started to walk away.  Dot checked the coast was clear, then followed.Up to the seventh floor, then higher.  Her body ached, every one of her movements harder than they had been before she had started climbing up to the top of this monstrous building, but she knew she was close.A dining hall, with lots of tables, and a kitchen off to one side.  It smelled like a hundred different foods.The two girls didn’t talk much as they walked.  The younger one was on the cusp of adulthood, but she smelled like blood and sickness.  She was blonde, wearing a dress.The older one had crossed the threshold to adulthood.  Her arms were striped or marked somehow, almost completely covered with freckles, and her brown hair was tied back into a ponytail.  She wore jeans and a top with spaghetti straps, and had a jacket folded over her arms, which she held close to her body.“You don’t find it sad?  Spending time around him like this?”“Sad?” Riley asked.  “No.  It’s… reassuring.”“How?”“It’s a crazy, fucked up, upside-down, inside-out world.  I think he understands that.  He lives in that world.  Not in a fantasy version of it.”“It seems to me like he lives entirely in the fantasy.”Riley chuckled.There was another security checkpoint.  The two passed through, and Dot was forced to hang back, watching them go through.  She couldn’t pass herself.  It was sealed off like the old kingdom had been.  What was the word?Quarantined.She found vents, and she climbed through the vents.  The vents, too, were quarantine-sealed.She hated that she was so close.  Her king was in arm’s reach, and she couldn’t touch him.  He was talking, right this moment, and she couldn’t hear him.Patience, she told herself.Patience.  A scout had to know patience.  She was here to free him, to give him power again, even if it meant him taking her apart and turning her into another kind of life that he could use.  Achieving that goal had always been something that would take time.She searched vents, and she found one that had a gap she could use.  She worked at it, wedging her box-cutter into the gap and wiggling it until she could get fingers in the gap.  She used strength to widen it further, felt air escape through the rubber seal she’d peeled away, and knew she’d broken through the quarantine protection.With more work, she was able to get an entire arm through.  Screws scraped against metal as she worked them through.She found her way into the walls, and from the walls, she found her way to a double-layered window with wire mesh between layers.  She could see glimpses of the scene from an angle, distorted, by peering through the side of the thick glass pane.The girl and the woman sitting at a table, separated from King Rinke by another thick glass wall.Almost frantic, Dot searched the interior of the walls, looking for gaps, anything she could use.  Everything was sealed, everything secured.The answer ended up being the power outlet.  She worked at the outlet, clawed at the seal that cemented it to the wall, and moved it enough that sound could get through.  Later, when it was quiet, she could get through too.“…a Red Queen and an Alice, then.”“Or you could call me by my name.”“I’m quite fond of Alice.  She was a chaotic force in the worlds she visited, you know.  She questioned, she challenged.  A revolutionary in absurd worlds held captive by their own conventions and riddles.”“This supposed Red Queen and I are friends, you know,” Alice Riley said.“I’m not sure I’d go that far,” the Red Queen said.“They were friends and enemies both in the story,” King Rinke said.“You know, Jamie, I told the Queen here that you were one of the people who really got it.  I drew comparisons to our friend Valkyrie.  The Queen and Valkyrie know each other, you know.”“I’m flattered by the comparison, my Alice.  I’m not surprised they know each other.  Queens are well-connected.”“I’m getting sort of sick of being called a Queen.”“My dear, you have all the power in the world.  You can move in any direction you choose.”“Less than you’d think.”“You’re here, aren’t you?”“I’m… I think if I’m here, it’s because I’ve been checkmated by her.  She implied she’d waste my time if I didn’t go along with this.”“It’s very, very easy for even a Queen to be checkmated, if she doesn’t act like a Queen.”“I’m starting to think I’m not smart enough to keep up with this conversation.”Riley the Alice laughed.“You should visit again, Red Queen.  Have tea.  Keep an old man company.”“You’re more than an old man,” the Alice said.“A king without a kingdom,” King Rinke said.“A fallen king is still a king,” the Alice said.King Rinke tittered.  Dot, hiding in the wall, smiled at the expression of joy.“Yes, I do remember that,” King Rinke said.“We should go soon,” the Alice said.  “We’ve finished our tea, and we’ve got work to do.  The Red Queen needs to check over the, ah, vial I’ve created that says ‘drink me’, and make sure it’s safe.”“Please don’t make anything like that,” the Queen said.  “I’d hate to see it go wrong.”“My work doesn’t go wrong.  Thank you very much.  It was wonderful to see you, Goblin King.  I’m sorry the visit was short.  I mostly wanted to introduce you two.”“It’s been an experience,” the Queen said.“What’s next for you, Red Queen?  What will you do, once you’ve seen what our Alice has been up to?”“I’ll… I guess I’ll be at my father’s side while talking to some of the most powerful people in all the known worlds, and I’ll see my parents, trying to say goodbye and yet unable to pull away, or making my greetings and being pushed away, and I’ll continue to feel like I’m in the wrong places every step of the way.”“You’re a queen.  You have such power.  You can go anywhere you want, if you’re willing to wield that power.  Your struggles are because you’re trying to be something you aren’t.  Take that as advice from a king who has lost his kingdom to a Queen who has yet to claim hers.”“I don’t like what happens when I try to use power to claim anything.”“Then use position.  The fact that you’re a queen affords you power by default.  If you stand in the right places, things will change as a result.  Use that.  Recognize it.  Things may start going the way you hope they might.”There was a pause.“I’ve said similar things,” the Alice said.“Yeah,” the Queen said.  “I worry because the only people willing to talk to me say similar things, but I’m not sure they’re people I should listen to.”“A king without a kingdom,” King Rinke said.“Let’s go with that,” the Alice said.  “That’s probably it.”There was a slight commotion, chairs moving, dishes clacking against surfaces, as the girl and the woman gathered themselves together and stood from their seats.“Come again, Red Queen.”“I can’t make promises, but I’ll be in the building a lot, and it’s not out of the realm of possibility.”There were more noises, and then doors shut.Knees pulled to her chest, tail wrapped around her, Dot felt warm and happy, her king’s words wrapped around her, filling her up.She barely dared to move the outlet, to force her way past it, to break the spell and to try to have more.But she had to save her king.The King had a bodyguard, a strong soldier of a man, taller than the King, muscular, and clearly dumb.  The bodyguard noticed her before the King did, and reached out to touch the King’s arm.“Ah,” King Rinke said.  He had a sad expression on his face.  “They’ve been watching me closer for the better part of the morning.  I suppose you’re why.”Dot wasn’t sure what to say or do.“Come.  Can you talk?” he asked.  He seated himself, his bodyguard reaching for the chair to steady it as the King sat.  The King stuck one leg straight out in Dot’s direction.“Yes,” she said.  She leaped forward in the same way and lurching way her heart leaped into her chest.  She ran up and along his leg, up him, to him.  Clawed fingers and feet clutched for the fabric of his shirt.  His gray-touched beard tickled her head and back.She could smell him and he smelled like home, like family and love.  She felt his hand on her back, and she felt it pet her.She could have cried, if she weren’t so dehydrated, if so much of her body’s energies and fluids hadn’t gone into bleeding and healing.  Every ache and pain, from hours of clinging to a shuddering train to fighting rats and scaling a building interior, prying her way past sealed building fixtures, it became a dull, throbbing reassurance that she’d done right.“You worked hard to get here.”She nodded.  “Yes.”“You’re the third to get this far.  One of only two that could talk.”Third?  She wanted to ask, but she was worried about the response.“I didn’t make you, did I?  You were birthed.  You look like Polka’s get.”She nodded, hard, head rubbing against his shirt as she clutched tighter.  He knew her.  He didn’t know her but he knew where she was from and so he knew her.“Polka the third?”“Fourth,” she said.  “But thank you for thinking I’m like the third.  She was the most beautiful and clever.”“The fourth was clever too,” he said.  He stroked her.“I come to save you,” she said.  “You can use me for material.”“I wouldn’t do that,” he said.  “Not for one as beautiful and noble and brave as you.  No.”She felt the tears well up.  Noble.  Highest of praise.“No,” he said again.  He gave her a stroke, from head and ears to tail, and then he reached down, hands on her arms and shoulders, and he moved her back and away.“No,” he said, a third time.With that, she understood what he was saying no to.“We need you.”“No.”“The others get sick and die.  They want to be recycled.”“No,” he said.  “No, daughter of Polka.  I’m too old, and I’m watched too closely.  They’re watching and listening even now.  We had our chance, and as our Kingdom stood on the brink of war, your king chose the wrong allies.  The Alice that just visited me was one.”Tears flowed now, but they weren’t tears of joy.“We lost.  I’m firmly in check.”“But-”“No,” he said.  He stroked her, then held her firm with one hand around her shoulders, while he reached for his tea.  Gently, carefully, he tipped it to her mouth.  “Drink.  You’re thirsty.  You look exhausted.  The caffeine will help.”Dutifully, she drank.“And then you should go.  Go back.  Find the others.  Take care of them.  Be gentle with humans you meet.  So few of them understand power, and so many of them have so much, now.”He moved the cup again, and she drank again.She shifted her feet, placing them under her, and then stood, one foot on each of his legs.She embraced him, arms in his beard, clutching at his shirt.  His hand pressed against her back, and her tail wrapped around his wrist.As quiet as she could manage, she whispered, “You say this because they’re listening.  You must want to be free.”She felt the hand at her back move, pulling her back and away again.  She leaned against it, moving back so she could see his face.She understood now, why the Alice had used the word ‘broken’.“There are things I’ve talked to my Alice and the Valkyrie about, but reclaiming my kingdom or starting another anew isn’t in any of the many realms of possibility or fancy.”“But-”“No,” he said, one last time, and the look of pain in his eyes was proof to the word.As she’d jumped to him as her heart had leaped with joy, she jumped away at the pain, both his and hers.“Your name, child?” he asked.“Dot.”He smiled.  “Fitting, for the daughter of Polka.”She nodded, but she didn’t feel like smiling.“Go home, noble dot.  Do us all proud.  Tell the others whatever they need to hear.”Her hand clutched at her chest, over her heart, and then she turned to go.  Into the wall.  Back the way she came.  Every ache and cut and scrape felt magnified as hurt radiated through her.Going down was as hard as going up had been, but this time she didn’t have anything to go to.Back to Blackspot, with his sickness and his hope of being reborn?  Back to Lump, who got weaker every day?To tell them what?More rats waiting for her, probably.  Other things.  More pain.  More machines, inching into their territory.As much as she hated to admit it, the others were dead.  She was one of the strongest who were left, that she knew about.  There were other tribes and groups, there were armies, but they fought for a kingdom that hadn’t had a king for a very long time.Hurt and pain turned black and angry inside her.She thought of the machines and she thought of Burnish’s words.  The fact that warning people of the machines might save her king.By the time she’d reached the sixth floor, moving slowly, the idea had found its root in her head, much like the the machines found root in rocks and metal, seeds of machinery that spun out and made it so a rock could crack like an egg, revealing gears and a thousand moving pieces.  Machines that made machines, all hiding and deceiving and inching forward with endless patience.Small things were capable.  She had power of her own.She needed purpose to drive her forward, and her purpose, the goal in her mind, was to go back to that store, to find a piece of machine, and then to put it on the train.The machines would hatch in the heart of all the known worlds and the humans would lose their kingdom too.It was that hate and thirst for vengeance that pushed her forward, now that she didn’t have her king to serve that role.  Those feelings boiled up, leaving wet streaks on her cheeks as she crept forward, from hiding place to hiding place, shadow to shadow.The stairs were tricky.  From the sixth floor to the fifth floor, it was open area, trick to navigate.  Someone sat on the stairs.The Red Queen.Dot settled in, finding a place to sit and wait.  She watched the one the King had called a Queen, and she licked her wounds, both real and metaphorical.  She wished she was interesting enough in design to lick her own heart.Something, a huff of pain, a wheezing breath, a scuffle, it made the Queen look.The pair locked eyes.“We got a warning about you,” the Red Queen said.  “You’re not getting up to trouble, are you?”Dot shook her head.“You’re hurt.  Come here.”Dot hesitated.  Then she crept closer.  She flinched as the Queen moved her hand.“It’s okay.  Move your hair aside.  I’ll touch the side of your neck.”Dot pawed at her hair, moving it.  She felt the touch at her neck.The pain around the cuts and the bites faded.  The aches and sore joints sang with euphoria as they became normal and the endorphins that had flooded her body to help remained.She reached out, with arms and tail, and wrapped herself around the Red Queen’s arm.  She stared at the tattoos, black and red, tracing one hand along the ray of a sun.  Not colorful enough, but… not bad.  She had spots, too, but of a very different sort.“Why are you sad?” the Red Queen whispered.“My king doesn’t want me,” Dot said.“Can I?” the Red Queen asked, moving her hand, and Dot saw.  Dot nodded, and closed her eyes as the Red Queen stroked her.  A different, lighter touch.“I’m stuck too,” the Red Queen said.  “I’ve finished my work for the day, but someone I’m supposed to stay away from is just downstairs.  I think I know how it feels.”“If I could have one thing only, I would have him close.”“Yeah.”“As a friend or a master or a King or anything.”“Yeah.”“But I can’t.”“And that anger of yours?  What are we going to do about that?”Dot might have been surprised, but King Rinke had called this woman a Queen and Queens were supposed to be capable of great things.She kept her mouth shut.  Amazed as she was, she wasn’t dumb.“How about… in exchange for that healing I just gave you, you keep me company for a little while?”Carefully, slowly, Dot crawled into the Red Queen’s lap.The Red Queen stroked her, and each stroke was like the inhalation, the exhalation, the single step toward feeling a little bit better.Even when the hand stopped moving, and rested on Dot’s shoulder, when Dot stared at the missing fingertips, she felt a little more okay.They sat there, long after the coast was clear for the Red Queen.  It was only when people came up the stairs that they were forced to move.  The Red Queen moved Dot closer, putting on her jacket, and closed up the jacket so Dot was held close, and it was good, Dot’s ear pressed down to the Red Queen’s heart.The Red Queen started down the stairs, one arm helping to keep Dot in position within her jacket.“I’ll help you with your anger if you help me with mine.”                                                                                        Shade – 4.1                                                                                           Ashley took her time exploring Hollow Point.  Much of her attention was on the stores and the people within them.  A store with supplies for those living on the fringes and in the tent cities, a used bookstore that was selling books taken from homes in the old world, ten dollars for a cardboard box full, a closed children’s clothing store.The people that noticed Ashley were quick to avert their eyes or mind their own business.She paused at a manicurist’s, looking within.  There were rows of comfortable looking chairs with small tables beside them and foot baths below each seat.  Ads in the window showed a variety of nail art.Ashley held out her hand in front of her, her black nail polish contrasted with the colorful ‘Chevalier’ pattern, mimicking the delicate gold flourishes on a silver background.  She moved her hand to compare to the ‘Alexandria’ image.She stepped away and walked a little ways down the street.  She peered into more closed buildings, passed a bar where the man at the counter pretended not to see her, and then walked by a clothing resale store.  She paused at a clothing store, and then entered.She looked through a series of black dresses and skirts, taking some off the rack and draping them over one arm.“Ma’am?” the store employee asked.  The young woman looked terrified.  “Can I help you with anything?”“I’ll let you know.”“Please do.  I’ll be at the counter.”Ashley continued browsing, picking out an assortment of dresses, until she had eight gathered.  She approached the change room and paused, looking at the sign that said only three articles of clothing could be brought into the changing area.She entered the area, but didn’t step into any of the booths.  Instead, she stood before the mirrors, holding dresses against her front.  She paused as the front door opened, the bell jingling.  A male voice asked a question, and the cashier said something in response.She left six of the dresses where they were, and took two with her as she returned to the woman’s side of the store.“Damsel of Distress,” the man said.  He wore a mask with antlers at the corner, forking and extending into the wild locks of hair.  He’d used face paint to blend his face into the mask, but the paint mixed multiple colors, with a golden sheen to the paint above his eyes and black on his lower eyelids and lower eye socket.  He wore a jacket that wouldn’t have looked out of place in Robin Hood, with a stag’s head and a singular antler in gold, running from the collarbone, along the collar, and over one shoulder.  “What brings you to Cedar Point?”“Is it Cedar Point or Hollow point?”“That depends on who you ask.  Some of the more colorful locals prefer the latter.”“The capes.”“The capes.  Yes.  I’m guessing you’re here for them more than you’re here for the shopping.”“I’m here to see what’s here,” she said.  She turned away from him to pick through some clothes.  She lifted the sleeve of a dress that was still on the rack, the dress was opaque, but the sleeve was sheer with a lace pattern worked into it.“And?”“And I’m not impressed so far.”“What did you expect to find that you’re not seeing?”“Organization.  A timely response to my arrival.  I’ve been walking around for nearly half an hour and you’re the first person to show their face.”“We prefer discretion.”“It feels toothless.  A sanctuary for villains, and you let people walk in here without stopping them?”“We’ve been keeping a close eye on you.”“Eyes aren’t teeth.”“Some are, when you add powers to the mix.  Shall we take this discussion outside?”Ashley looked at the two dresses in her hand.  She put one back where it belonged, and then approached the counter.“Um,” the salesgirl said.  “You can have it.  It’s on the house.”“Is it?” Ashley asked.“Store policy.  The owner hopes that you’ll have a positive view of the store, in case of future trouble.  Would you like a bag?”Ashley looked at the dress, then shook her head, slinging the dress over one shoulder.  She looked at the villain with the antlers.  “We can talk outside.”“I’ll be right with you.”She walked out of the store, glancing over one shoulder to see him discreetly passing some bills to the salesgirl, who ducked her head in acknowledgement.The streets were mostly empty, without many cars, parked or otherwise.  Some of the stores had tunnels or alleys that led to parking lots, but even those didn’t have many vehicles.  Employee parking, when many stores had only one employee on average.“I’m Prancer, by the by,” Prancer said, as he exited the store.“The messenger.”“I’m- no.  Not a messenger,” he said.  “If Cedar Point is anyone’s, it’s mine.”“I was there when you first raised the idea of a gathering place.”“Then you know what we’re doing.”“I walked away halfway through your speech.”“Ah,” Prancer said.A car pulled out of the alley, turned a corner, and then drove through the neighborhood, not slowing as it passed the pair.“Normally when one villain visits another’s territory, there’s a token show of respect.”“Normally,” Ashley said, “the person holding the territory does something to earn the respect.  Normally, when someone brings up respect, they’re prepared to back up their words.  Are you going to back up your words and give me some evidence that you deserve even a token show of respect?”Prancer didn’t immediately reply.  The two stared each other down.“You’re going to be one of the difficult ones, it seems,” Prancer said.“If you’re relying on convention and expectation then yes, I am.  If you show me you deserve my time and respect, I’ll give you it.  If you think I’ll give it to you because you run this territory, you’ll be sadly disappointed.  I might even supplant you.”“That’s a dangerous game, Damsel of Distress.  Making threats, forcing people to play their hands.  You don’t know what cards someone has up their sleeves.”“I have ideas.  You appeared alone, no bodyguard, no backup.  You appeared late.  You can’t back up your reputation.”“You might have the wrong ideas about the kind of territory this is.”“Enlighten me,” Ashley said.  It almost sounded like a threat.“Come.  Walk with me,” he said.They started walking down the sidewalk, in a neighborhood where a third of the businesses were closed.Prancer did the talking for the first leg of their walk.  “Any community of capes will have its rules.  Standards and things it does that benefit everyone in it.  I’m not a warlord.  I manage a very diverse group.  If someone causes a problem, if someone tests us, I can and will give that diverse group direction or adjust the rules.  I can and will point one of the many, many powers we have at our disposal here at that someone.  Some are dangerous, some are devious, and some aren’t even parahuman kinds of powers.”“Political.”“Economic.  Social,” Prancer said.  “I might not be a warlord, I might not even be a warrior, but I have reach.  A few words from me, and you might find it very hard to find work with a parahuman group.  You might find that people won’t recruit you or do business with you.”“Am I supposed to be concerned?  I’m not looking to join any team, Prancer.  I’m not looking to buy or sell petty drugs or prostitutes.  When I decide to act, I’ll be leading a team, not joining one, and people will flock to me regardless of what you say.  They’ll do business with me because there’s no other choice.  I’m ready to call that bluff of yours.”“And be the first I make an example of?  No.  I’m something of a schemer, a bit of a politician, and I’m a very good businessman.  But if you’re going to deal with me, you should know that above any and all of that, I’m a salesman.  If we’re talking about bluffs, I know bluffs when I see them, Damsel of Distress.  I know you came here because you want something.”“I did.  I finished some shopping and I have your measure, and I have the measure of your neighborhood.”“Something drew you away from your cozy apartment in an unassuming neighborhood, away from your regular appointments with therapists and the Wardens.  Your years of history before Gold Morning are a pattern of laying low, being quiet, committing crimes to get food and clothes, and then getting restless and bored.  That’s when you traditionally start stirring up trouble.  Are you restless?”“You read my files.  If you’re expecting that level of access to intimidate me, you’ll be disappointed.”“I think you’re bored.  I know you’ve been hanging around the Cabin, or the Lodge if you want to call it that.  I know you like spending time at the tea shop.  I know that when you get restless you often look for people to spend time with.  The Jewel of Boston, the Slaughterhouse Nine.  We know how those stories ended.”“I’m alive and many of them are dead.”“That’s not how I would have put it, but alright,” Prancer said.  “If you want something here, you should ask.”“I thought I might want to find a place around here, but if you’re slow to respond to my arrival, you might be slow to stop heroes from getting in my way.”“You want a place in the community?”“And security, assurance I won’t be harassed.  You know about the appointments.  They’re why I’m left free when other ex-members of the Slaughterhouse Nine are still under lock and key.  They study me then, I let them, and I want to leave it at that, for those days and those times only.  I don’t want to be surveilled or scrutinized when I don’t have to be.”“We have a variety of security measures in place.  If you chose to move here, if we allowed you to, I think you’d be satisfied.”“Empty assurances.”“More robust assurances would come only when we knew we could trust you to some degree.  Obviously, we’re not about to share particulars with a stranger.  You could turn around and join a rival group and share that information with them.”“And if I became less of a stranger, it would require an investment of time and trust.  At that point it would be hard to escape.  Sunken cost.”“Then it seems we’re at an impasse.”“So it seems.”“And I can expect you to leave promptly, then.”“I’ll leave when I’m ready,” Ashley said.  She turned to walk in another direction, heading for another clothing store.⊙“Switch to the overhead camera.  I want to see what Prancer says and does.”“I’ll project onto the other wall,” Kenzie said.  “I want to keep the main camera on Ashley.”She struck a few keys.  One face of the projector box behind her desk lit up, projecting onto the wall.  The image was blurry and badly affected by the light around the room at first, as any projector screen could be, but it swiftly clarified, crystallizing into an image as sharp as any flatscreen television.  It was an overhead of the street.The overhead image split, until that screen showed two camera views of Prancer at the same time, one directly overhead, and another that gave something of a view of his face.The main camera, on the wall in front of and above Kenzie’s desk, showed Ashley’s point of view.  The view bobbed with every step Ashley took, and was periodically obscured when Ashley blinked.Tristan was bringing things into the room.  The team’s temporary accommodation.  Rain was in the corner, where a table had been set up, laying out parts of mechanical arms while Chris watched.In the center of the room, Sveta, Natalie the law student and I watched things on the cameras.Natalie had her arms folded.  Her hair was shorter than most boys wore theirs, with a curl at the forehead, her glasses seemed oversized for her face, and her forehead was wrinkled in worry or concentration.  She dressed in clothes that made me think she’d picked clothes out of a magazine without reading the rationale behind those clothes.  She wore a blouse that fit her body closely, made of a faintly reflective material, with a black ribbon tied where it drew the collar together.  She wore a straight-cut skirt that started at the waist and ended at the knee, and dark hose, with tidy, heel-less business shoes.  It was the kind of thing that made a model in a magazine look stunning, but Natalie was five-foot two, she didn’t really have a waist, and the outfit made both of those things very obvious.“What do you think?” I asked.“I think it would be very hard to explain to a judge why your agent took the free clothes from the store,” Natalie said.  “I think you could explain it, but it feels like an implicit protection racket and that’s something that would be thrown in your faces.”“Hey Tristan.  Can I grab one of those whiteboards?” I asked.“Sure.”The whiteboard didn’t have the legs or rollers attached yet, so Sveta held it upright for me.  I wrote down the bit about taking the dress ‘on the house’.“I don’t like the threatening tone, either.  Entrapment has a pretty high bar, but if your agent threatens the targets, implicitly or explicitly, to insinuate herself into that environment, it casts a lot of it into jeopardy.  They’ll turn around and say they had to do these things because a woman in black who can kill people by pointing at them was telling them to.”I wrote it down.  “We’ll tell her to tone it down.  How long until we can communicate with her, Kenzie?”Kenzie spun around in her computer chair, pulling her legs close to her chest to keep them out of the way of the desk’s edge.  She stuck out a foot, kicking one of the boxes to the right of the desk.  A bar appeared diagonally across it.  “Sixty percent.  Ummmm.  Fifteen minutes until we can be totally sure they’re not tapped into cell towers or internet.”“I actually have a lot of concerns about her as an undercover agent.”“She’s not an undercover agent,” Tristan said.  “She’s just there.  Keeping an eye on things, keeping an ear out.”“That’s an undercover agent,” Natalie said.“She isn’t joining any team or participating in anything,” Tristan said.“No espionage, no immediate risk,” Chris added his voice.“I have concerns,” Natalie said.  “I’ll just say that.”Ashley was investigating a bookstore now, on the main screen.  Our testing of the waters.On the other screen, Prancer was meeting a trio of others.Kenzie glanced at it and hit a key.  Windows popped up, with three-dimensional models of each face, mask included.  A young woman with a purple hood with nascent antlers sticking up through it, a skinny woman with rusty nails instead of teeth, and a woman in a white jacket with a doctor’s face mask.I named them.  “Velvet and Nailbiter.  That might be Bitter Pill, but she hasn’t shown her face or been photographed any for the files.  Is there sound?”Kenzie hit a key on her keyboard.  “It’s going to kill the flying camera’s battery.  We get a minute or two and then I need to bring it home.  Or we get three minutes and I bring it halfway home, and someone has to go over to pick it up wherever I land it.”“Alright.”“…up to?” Velvet asked, her voice playing from a speaker.“Looking around.  She was thinking of moving in, but she didn’t like how long it took us to turn up,” Prancer said.“She’s aware we were watching her, isn’t she?”“No.  And she doesn’t give a shit, either.  I outright told her and she was more concerned about the fact we hadn’t shown ourselves sooner.  She’ll be a problem if she sticks around.”“What kind of problem?”Tristan, Rain, and Chris had stopped what they were doing and drew close, to listen and watch.“She was quick to talk about supplanting the local leadership.  We operate with a soft hand and she seems like the sort that respects only firm ones.  There’s more to it, ties into something we’ve heard from… key voices.  I’d rather have that conversation somewhere more private than this.”“Do you want me to deal with her?” Nailbiter asked, her words whistling through her teeth.“No,” Prancer said.“Why am I here then?”“Because I think you and her are similar.  You respect strength, you know how power works.  You’ve dealt with scary customers.  If we end up interacting with her more, and especially if she moves into the neighborhood, I think we want you to be on point, interacting with her more.”“I can do that.  She was Slaughterhouse?”“Briefly, and you were Birdcage.  I think a lot of the same principles apply.”Nailbiter chuckled, a wheezy, whistling sound.  “I never thought of that.  Probably.”“If this visitor of ours winds up being a problem, I don’t want you stepping into the fray against her.”“Why not?” Nailbiter asked.“Because I don’t know how it would turn out.  I’d rather make moves where I know the result in advance.”“Whatever,” Nailbiter said.Velvet made a sound, then drew closer to Prancer, putting her arm around him.  He put his arm around her.  “Not whatever.  I like that kind of thinking.”“Thank you,” Prancer said.“I’m curious what that thing is that you don’t want to talk about in the open,” Velvet said.  “Can we go inside?”“We can.  You’re free to carry on with your day, Nailbiter.  Thanks for coming.  Pill, I want to ask you about some import-export work.  Can you come?”There was no sound from Bitter Pill, only a nod that the camera caught.The group split up, Nailbiter walked away.  The trio headed into an alleyway.  The airborne camera moved, trying to get a view of the alley interior, and only saw a door close.The image changed, as Kenzie typed.  It showed an overhead map of the area.  Kenzie marked the building they’d entered with a red highlight and a little flag icon, then began typing out a note.“Can you get sound of building interiors?” I asked.“Kind of not really,” Kenzie said.“That’s real clear,” Chris said.“I’ve got one camera with good aerial camouflage that I really don’t want to get damaged because it took a whole weekend and a lot of stuff to put it together.  I have two more that don’t have special camouflage, they’re just painted to match the sky, and I can only use them if the sky is the right color, or if I don’t mind them being spotted.  They could get destroyed and I wouldn’t mind them breaking that much.  It would take me something like two days to get more advanced sound built into any of them, and then I’m putting a lot of eggs in one basket or I’m making a disposable camera not so disposable.”“But you can do it?” I asked.“I’m better with visuals, but yeah, I can do it.”“Even if we decided it was worth building, it would take a while before you had that kind of microphone online,” Rain said.“It’s a sound camera, not a microphone,” Kenzie said.  “But yeah.  And I’m trying to figure out the teleporters and the longer ranged cameras and I’ve got to fix up some old stuff so it’s ready if we need it, and that’s all stuff I really should do, and if I’m doing that I’m not doing any of the fun stuff.”Ashley, on her screen, paused to write something down.LEAVING SOONShe used a small burst of her power to destroy the paper shortly after writing it down.Kenzie snapshotted the note, then typed it up, adding it to a log in the sidebar, where it joined two other brief notes that Ashley had written on her way into Cedar Point.“One thing I’ll say about Ashley?” Tristan said.  “She’s provocative.  From what I saw of that conversation, she impugned Prancer’s leadership right off, forced him to prove himself, gave us a sense of the power structure.  She almost had him talking about anti-surveillance measures, but he’s being smart about keeping that mostly under wraps.”“He probably has some we haven’t heard or talked about,” I said.“She didn’t make any friends while she was doing all of that,” Rain said.“We don’t need her to make friends,” Tristan said.  “She’s not going undercover.  Not explicitly.  She’s just… there.  Keeping an eye on things.”I said, “My instinct is that if she keeps pushing on the level she was, people will get antsy or suspicious.  It might be good to have her hang back, wait a bit before making contact or visiting again.”“I could swing through,” Chris said.“We should wait until we’re more settled,” Tristan said.“There are actually a few obstacles to figure out,” I said. “Sorry to take over the one whiteboard here.”“We got a lot of the whiteboards because we thought we’d have one for each member of the team, and one for you, Victoria,” Rain said.  “Two for Kenzie and two for me because we’re tinkers and you can never give tinkers too many surfaces to write stuff down on.”“Yus,” Kenzie said.  Her legs were kicking a mile a minute as she focused on her computers, a box to her right and the projector box on the far side of her desk, the camera images playing on the wall.  One of the split-screen images showing the overhead of the building Prancer had entered turned red, blacked out, and then disappeared, shrinking down to leave the other image, which was tracking Nailbiter.“Can you project the faces you had onto one of the whiteboards?” Sveta asked.Kenzie brought up images, then moved the projected image until it overlapped one side of the whiteboard.  She had to look over one shoulder as she moved the mouse to make sure the image was in place.Sveta dropped her hand, and used a tendril-wrapped marker to slowly trace out major facial features, hair, and the outlines of the masks for Prancer.I looked at Natalie.Natalie’s forehead, perpetually wrinkled, wrinkled further as she raised her eyebrows, looking from whiteboard to whiteboard, screen to screen.  “I recommend moving slowly at first.  I’ll give you some general, not-a-lawyer advice on things for free.  It’s interesting and it’s relevant to what I want to do in the long run.”“Okay,” I said.  “That’s great.  I’m not sure how slow the initial moves are going to be, though.  The team needs to get some things out of the way before they have more freedom.”Sveta turned her head.  “The stuff Foresight said?”“Yeah,” I said.  “We’re situated on the very outskirts of Cedar Point, here, and you can’t move into the area until a few hurdles are crossed.  You can’t really have Ashley or Chris spend any extended time in the area until the Speedrunners, Birdbrain and Braindead are dealt with, and we can’t move this headquarters into enemy territory if they’re going to find it and trash the place.  In an ideal world, you’ll want to do something about Tattletale’s involvement too.”“I’ve been thinking of Tattletale as an inevitable thing we’ll have to deal with,” Rain said.“There are things you can do,” I said.  “We can discuss those things when Natalie is gone.”“Actually,” Natalie said.  “I should probably go.  I have a class tomorrow morning and then work at the Wardens’ building tomorrow afternoon.”A class.  I felt a tiny bit of resentment over the fact that she had that.“Alright.  Thank you for coming and saying hi,” I said.“It’s interesting,” she said, forehead wrinkling in that worried way.  “I really recommend you be careful.”“As careful as is possible,” Sveta said.Natalie nodded.  “It was nice to meet you all.  You have my number if you need it.”There was a chorus of farewells.  I walked Natalie to the side door of the building, where the fire escape was.  The way down was steep, and she kept one hand on her little messenger bag and the other on the railing as she made her way down, bringing one foot down to a step, then bringing the other foot down to the same step.Her entire demeanor made me feel faintly anxious.  I didn’t have a great read on her yet, she’d spent ten minutes at the temporary headquarters here, and most of it had been spent observing.It was something of a relief to have her available if we needed her, and it was a different kind of relief to have her gone.  The others, too, seemed to relax a bit.“Natalie seemed nice enough,” Sveta said.“She did,” I said.I took a moment to get Natalie’s number off my phone and put it on one corner of the whiteboard I’d been using, the whiteboard leaning against the wall.  I then wrote down Gilpatrick’s, with a note beneath it.  For emergencies only.The Patrol was a resource, Gilpatrick was one too.  I didn’t want to overuse that card, though.  Gilpatrick had already been too kind with being a reference for me while I hunted for work.With those numbers in the top corner, joined by my own, I wrote down ‘Hurdles’.We’d already covered the basics of the major players on the scene.  Speedrunners, Birdbrain, Braindead, Bitter Pill.  There were others that we’d learn about, I was sure.  Prancer was the closest thing we had to a kingpin that needed toppling.In a hypothetical world where everything went perfectly, I wouldn’t have minded getting Tattletale as a part of things.  I wasn’t sure my hopes were that high.I put them down as the people the group needed to knock down before they could fully set up.I wrote down ‘Team: Needs name & brand.’“Ooh,” Kenzie said.She was watching me write stuff down, her attention no longer on her computers.“Here,” Tristan said, approaching my whiteboard.  He held it up, and then created the orange sparks.  They solidified, becoming the legs that raised the whiteboard up to a convenient level.“There’s no rush to name ourselves,” Sveta said.“No rush,” I said.  “But it needs doing.  It’ll be easier to interact with other heroes once you have something.  Are you taking a cape name?”“Probably,” she said.  “I’m not sure I want to go the doll route.  A little too similar to Mannequin.  A lot of the reaching, grabbing names are already taken.”“Brainstorm, think about it, see what feels comfortable,” I said.  “Kenzie and Tristan, you guys too.  You probably can’t use your old cape names.”“I was Optics,” Kenzie said.  “I can’t use my old name, I don’t think.  PRT owned it.”“Exactly,” I said.“I think I can use Capricorn,” Tristan said.  “When we reached out to the first Capricorn for permission, they signed over the rights to Byron and me, not to Reach.”“You’re sure?” I asked.“Ninety-nine percent sure.”“That simplifies things,” I said.“Observer, Pupil, Scrutinizer,” Kenzie said.“Those are terrible,” Chris said.“Um.  Watcher.  Eyewitness, Gape?”“Oh yeah,” Chris said.  “Gape.  That doesn’t have connotations at all.”“Beholder?” Kenzie asked, her eye on her computer screen.  “Spectator.  Specs.  Voyeur?”“Voyeur.  Perfect,” Chris said, filling his voice with sarcasm.  “Little Kenzie watching through the window while you change.  We could make that a thing.”“What kind of thing?” Rain asked.“You could be Groper,” Chris said.  “Sveta could be Hentai or Tentacle Love or something.”“Ew,” Sveta said.  “And lame to go there.”Chris smiled, seemingly not bothered that he’d bothered Sveta.  “I could be…”“Short and curly?” Rain asked.There were a few chuckles.“And Victoria, she needs a name and she’s sort of a member of the team,” Chris said.“I’m shocked, just shocked, at how Chris finally starts participating more when the rude stuff comes up,” Sveta said.“I’m not,” Kenzie said.  “That seems like it’s one hundred percent Chris.”I smiled.  Chris had given me an in, and if I was going to get along with these guys, I needed to put something out there.  “If you want to give me a vaguely rude name, tie it to my attention-grabbing aura, me being hard to crack when my defenses are up?”“You have an idea?” Chris asked.“Pearl,” I said.“That’s… really subtle,” he said.  “Kind of wimpy.”I shrugged.“I don’t get it,” Kenzie said.“I like it because Kenzie doesn’t get it, so I don’t feel weird saying it around her,” I said.“That’s a good line of thinking,” Sveta said.  “I approve.”She’d stuck out her fist, and I stuck out mine to meet it.  “Thank you.”“I actually agree with Chris,” Kenzie said.  She’d turned around and was looking something up online.  “Pearl is pretty lame as innuendo goes.”“But it works,” I said.  “It fits.  That has to count for something.”There was a throat-clearing noise, interrupting the back-and-forth.  All heads turned toward Tristan.“I think I have all of you beat,” Tristan said.“Of course you do,” Rain said.“Even if you didn’t have us beat, you’d say you had us beat,” Chris said.  “And then you’d ruin the joke by insisting you win even when yours is lame.”“I’m one hundred percent positive I win,” Tristan said.  “I have the best rude name.  Guarantee you.”“One hundred percent is pretty confident,” Sveta said.“I’m one hundred and ten percent confident, even,” Tristan said.“Out with it, then,” Chris said.Tristan straightened, fixed his armor at the front, and cleared his throat, drawing it out.“You’re setting us up for disappointment,” Rain said.Tristan cleared his throat again, exaggerated, until everyone from Sveta to Chris was rolling their eyes.“Wet and Horny Teens,” Tristan said.It said something that nobody wanted to give him a laugh at that.  It was Chris who cracked first, falling out of his seat before the impact let the initial guffaw loose.  I chuckled, half at Tristan, and half at how much Chris seemed to be enjoying this.“That’s atrocious,” Sveta said, but she was smiling.“Tristan is pretty atrocious, so it makes a lot of sense coming from him,” Rain said.  “It says a lot that that’s his idea of subtle.”“It’s subtle like a brick through a window,” Sveta said.“Come on,” Tristan said.  “You guys give me so much shit, you don’t give me any credit.  I deserve a win for this one.  It’s great.”Chris was on the floor still, pounding one fist on the floorboards while holding in his laughs.I looked over at Kenzie, who had her back to the group, her face in her hands as she held in her laughs.Immature, stupid, but so valuable to have the little bonding moment.  I had a smile on my face as I returned to the whiteboard.My eye returned to the people the group needed to take down, the ones who were in the way, or who were set up in such a way as to make the covert information gathering fail from the get-go.I wrote down ‘Rain’s situation’.He needed protection.  I added the three members of his cluster, and then drew an arrow, looping back to Tattletale.The smile dropped away from my face as I stared at her name.  It kept going back to her.  She was a massive obstacle.Sveta came to stand next to me, looking at my whiteboard.  “Distract me from these perverts.”I stuck out my marker, putting a dot beside Tattletale’s name.“You’ve got a bit of a grudge,” Sveta said.“I’ve got a lot of a grudge,” I said.  “A lot of things would be simpler if we could do something about her.  I’m thinking…”“You have an idea?” Sveta asked.“Yeah,” I said.  I turned around.  “I have an idea.  I don’t suppose you have any contacts or favors you can pull in?  With capes, specifically?”“Maybe,” Sveta said.  “Weld, and Weld’s friends.  I’m kind of reluctant to go there though.”I nodded.  It made sense that she was reluctant.  Sveta wanted to stand on her own.  Going that route would be the opposite of what she wanted.“What’s this?” Rain asked.“Friends, contacts,” Sveta said.  “Capes we could reach out to.  Victoria has an idea.”“I do,” Kenzie said, perking up some as she caught wind of our conversation.  “Or I might.  I can try.  What’s this for?”“Making a first move, in a way that won’t give the lawyer headaches,” I said.  “It’s not going to make us any friends though.”“Seems to be an emerging pattern, that,” Rain said.If we aren’t in a position to behead the snake, maybe we can de-fang it.                                                                                           Shade – 4.2                                                                                           “Classify the following angles as obtuse, acute, or right,” Kenzie said.  She sighed.“You know this?” I asked.She looked up from her homework and rolled her eyes.  “Yes, I know this.  I didn’t have the words to describe what I knew before taking the class but I get this.”“Make it interesting,” I said.  “Challenge yourself, try to answer as fast as you can, and try to get past where you’re having to think about it and get to where the knowledge is automatic.”“Acute, acute, obtuse, right, acute, obtuse, acute, right, right,” she said.  “I’m really tempted to sit down and make up my own questions to leave on the worksheet for the teacher, except I’d have to look things up to make sure some mathematician didn’t already give it a name.  What’s it called when it’s a full circle?  Three hundred and sixty degrees of angle?”I frowned.  “You’re asking me to think back about seven years right now.  Complete, I think?”“Full, complete, or perigon,” Chris said.All heads craned around to look at him.  He was sitting in a corner, a table to his left, with so many things piled up that the bag, costume, snacks and notebooks loomed well over the top of his head.  He sat on a chair with his feet up on the seat, a comic and phone on his lap.  He had his headphones on, but only one was covering an ear.He realized people were looking and frowned.  “What?”“You actually have a brain?” Tristan asked.“I studied it a few weeks ago,” Chris said, shrugging, turning his attention back to his comic.“I’m pretty sure I don’t remember studying that when I was your age,” Tristan said.“I self-study.  There aren’t enough seats in schools so they gave us the option of doing these workbooks and handing them in.  I’ve lost track of how far ahead I got,” Chris said.  “It’s why I don’t have homework.  My regular schoolwork is the homework and I get that done earlier in the day.”“Perigon,” Kenzie said to herself, hunched over her worksheet and books, a pen in hand.  “That one sounds best.  Let’s call this one a… hyper-perigon angle.”“More complete an angle than a circle?” I asked.“Yeah,” she said.  “If you want to get into multidimensional space then you have to get there somehow.  So you make a circle that’s more closed than a regular circle and that gives you an in, right?  It can be theoretical if you want but obviously this is one of a hundred ways I can start pushing the boundaries.”“Uh huh.”She drew on the paper with her pen, drawing out a perfect circle and then scribbling out extra lines and numbers.“You’re aware you can’t hand that in now, right?” I said.“It’s fine, it’s fine,” Kenzie said.  “Once you’re there you can start thinking about lenses positioned to use the excess space you’ve given yourself and play that out.  I heard somewhere that images that hit the back of your eye get flipped upside-down, and the brain turns it back upright.  So we write something down that lets us toy with that concept…”Her pen moved as she wrote out a mathematical formula.“…And from there we get the reflected extra space on the other side of the lens constant.  In brief, we start talking about hyper-hyper-perigon angles.”“Hyper is right,” Chris muttered.“Shh, leave her alone,” Sveta said.Kenzie looked up at me, “This is where I have to leave you behind, Victoria, because I get stuff that’s hyper-hyper but I can’t help you get it.”“Frankly, you left me behind a minute ago,” I said.  “What are the hearts, stars, and apples you’re writing down?”“It’s algebra, duh.  You don’t have to use X and Y or A and B.  You can use anything to represent the variable.  I like hearts and stars and apples.”“I feel like if you autopsied Kenzie, she’d have a bowl of breakfast cereal instead of gray matter.”Kenzie spun around, sticking out a hand to grab the desk so she didn’t keep spinning.  She stared at Chris, “I feel like if we autopsied you, Chris, we’d find you have one of those tumors with teeth, eyes and hair in it instead of a brain.”“There’s a good chance you actually would,” Chris said.  “That’d be cool.”“Yes it would,” Kenzie said, very seriously.  She spun herself around, grabbing the desk, now facing her defaced homework.Sveta walked over from the whiteboard, where she’d finished tracing the faces that had once been projected onto it.  An artist’s sketch of the  players we’d seen and been involved with.  Another part of the whiteboard had some name ideas.“You can’t hand that in,” Sveta said.“I said that already,” I said.Kenzie looked up at me.  “People often ask how the tinkering stuff works.  It’s real easy.  All it takes is closing a circle extra closed and having the right lens to use the wrinkles and bulges that result.”“Easy,” I said, smiling a little.She continued drawing out math and lines.  She had a steady hand when it came to drawing out the geometry.  I idly wondered if her tinker power played into that.  She began drawing out a gun, similar to her flash pistol.The drawing of a woman’s face was comparatively, almost ludicrously crude compared to the gun she’d drawn out.  Kenzie scribbled out the eyes, then wrote out ‘I gave boring angle homework and now I’m blind foreverrrr’.She wrote out a few more ‘r’s and then paused, scribbling out ‘boring’ and writing ‘obtuse’ above the scribble.“Kenzie,” Sveta said, with a truly impressive amount of disappointment in the one word.Kenzie turned her head slightly, looking up at Sveta with one eye that twinkled with mischief.  She looked back at her work, writing down an extra ‘oh no’ by the teacher’s head.I cocked my head, listening as Kenzie worked with renewed energy.“You’re getting carried away,” Sveta said.I looked at the boxes near Kenzie, saw the projector box  to Kenzie’s right had a face lit up.  It was pointed at the whiteboard Sveta had been working on, but no longer projected the camera images of the faces.Reaching down, I plucked the pen from Kenzie’s hand.She didn’t protest or stop me, only leaning back as I picked up the paper.I walked a few paces away, holding up the sheet, glanced back at the projector box, and then walked another two paces.The projected image of the scribblings, tinker notes and doodles disappeared.  I turned it around to show Sveta.She took the sheet, then experimented with moving it inside and beyond the boundaries of the projector box.  Kenzie perched on the edge of her seat, watching, her tongue sticking out between her teeth, where she lightly bit it.“Well played,” I said.“I said it was fine,” she said.“You did.”“She filled in some of the right answers with real pen marks while scribbling,” Sveta observed.  She turned the sheet around, moving it through the air.The scratched out word with ‘obtuse’ over it had been cover for putting ‘obtuse’ into one of the blanks.“Very well played,” I said.Sveta handed the sheet back.  Kenzie put it down and moved her hand.  The projector moved the image of the scribblings on her whiteboard, leaving the sheet normal.  She flipped it over and sighed, head lolling back.  Without looking at the sheet, she said, “Acute, right, obtuse, acute, acute, obtuse.”Sveta approached, putting a hand on Kenzie’s head.  “How about instead of doing the math homework you could do in your sleep, you take advantage of having us here to help you with stuff you aren’t as strong with?  What do you struggle with?”“I get As in everything and A pluses in some stuff.  But I work on English for the longest and I’m a little less good at gym.  Mostly when I get bad marks it’s because I lost marks because my teachers are fed up with me.”“Fed up?” I asked.“Mrs. Beyer docked my grade because I wanted to stay inside at recess to talk with her about a project and she said I couldn’t and she needed a break from me.  She said no ifs ands or buts and I said but, so she penalized my grade.  Then when I tried to argue she took off a mark for every word I said.  Five marks for five words, and one for the but- don’t even say it, Chris.”Chris was talking with Tristan and Rain.  “You’re so self-important you think I’m listening to you?”Kenzie smiled, rolling her eyes a bit.“English, then?” Sveta asked.“It takes me the longest,” Kenzie said.Sveta looked at me.  “How were you in English?”“B minus or thereabouts,” I said.  “I did better with the courses I took at the hospital than I did in high school.”“How come?”“I write good papers and I’m good with themes and symbolism, but the classes I took in high school spent so long on each thing I felt like my brain was turning inside out with boredom.  I’d start resenting the books and I sabotaged myself by not doing the related work or reading it myself.  Don’t do that, Kenzie.”“I do well in English, even with the parts we sit on forever,” Sveta said.  “I’ll take point in helping Kenzie, you help?”“Sure,” I said.My role ended up being even more backseat than that.  Sveta had read the book, and I hadn’t.  I stood back, watching, glanced back at the others, where the three boys were talking video games, which they had been doing since before Kenzie had started on her homework, and I rolled my eyes.Rain stepped away from the conversation.  Grabbing a marker from the packet, he wrote ‘Rain’ at the top corner of his whiteboard.Below that, he wrote, ‘names’, followed by ‘Bracer’, ‘Clasp’, and ‘Pinch’.I approached, looking.“No homework?” I asked.“I like to do it late.  My family mostly leaves me alone while I’m doing it, and I get to tire out my brain and distract myself from what sleeping actually involves.  I can go straight from that to bed.”I nodded.  “Sounds like you have a system then.  If you ever need help with studying, I’m happy to help.”“I’m a pretty crummy student, but I get by.  I think I’ll be okay.”“You’re sure?”“Yeah.  I can’t see myself doing anything that leans too heavily on the school thing anyway.”“You’d be surprised at how it comes into play,” I said.“Maybe.  But…  I dunno if I see myself being alive and well a few years from now.  That might be some of it.”“Because of your cluster?”“Because capes don’t tend to live that long.  Because things were going south well before Gold Morning and it doesn’t feel like anything’s over or stopped.  Every day, I think about the fact that there are still Endbringers out there.  Broken triggers.  Dangerous people with too much power.”“There’s heroes.  People stopping those things.  Maybe you’ll be one of them.  People die- it sucks but not all of them die.  Not all of us.”“I guess,” he said.  “It might sound like I’m trying to ask for a pep talk, but I’m really not.  Right now, I’m focused on things I gotta do.  Like a name.”That was my signal to back off.  Fine.“Clasp is a fairly decent name.  Could work with the right costume.  I’m not sure it feels right with the blaster power.”“I was thinking of seizing something, as a prelude to something, or unclasping as… it sounded better in my head.  Don’t laugh at my terrible names or reasoning, please,” he said.  “Making a name that captures all of your powers when you have four is a pain in the ass.  I’m just brainstorming.”“I’m not going to make fun,” I said.  “I have no idea what I’m going to call myself when I get back to the costumed heroics.”“Yeah,” he said.   “I was trying to think of names that might sound like they refer to the hands and the set-up, knock-down part of the power.  Kind of.  I don’t know.”“Bracer’s taken, by the way,” I said.  “I’m not sure of the others.”He reached down to the pile of stuff at the foot of his board and picked up one of his tinker arms.  It was just a bit thinner than his regular arm, just a bit shorter.  Kenzie’s picture of a gun had looked more ‘tinker’ than this.  It was wires with sheet metal bent into a crude, hand-like shape around it.  He brought the textured plastic pad up to his shoulder and bound the straps around his shoulder, armpit, and upper arm before tapping it twice.  He winced, showing his teeth momentarily.“Hurts?” I asked.“Nervous connection, and a bit of excess energy with the switch-on.  I could fine tune it so it doesn’t shock me, but I might break something in the process.  Ashley’s hands are made by someone who doesn’t even focus on prosthetics and they’re better than what I make.”“You might be better than you think.”“Mrs. Yamada thinks I have self esteem problems, but I do suck, so it’s more like I’m too aware of my reality.  My blaster power is okay, because it’s mine, but it’s kind of all or nothing, leaning just a bit toward nothing, especially if I’m avoiding trying to kill, which I am.”“Okay,” I said.  I thought of him jumping off the train.  I wondered how honest he was about it.  “The mover power, it lets you…”“Stop.”He stepped back, then jogged a few steps, stopping mid-run, as if he’d frozen in time.  He hadn’t, though.  While suspended at an angle someone else would have tipped over, he twisted around and put a foot out to one side.  He moved in another direction, back to his board.“Any limitations?  If I used my full strength and threw you, would you only slow down?”“No.  I’d stop.  If I timed it right, I could fall from a plane, hit terminal velocity and then stop myself just before hitting the ground.  It’s- it’d be useful then, it’s useful if I want to not fall over or if I want to maneuver a bit.  But it’s not that amazing as powers go.”He wasn’t lying, then.  Not about that.  There were uses, but it did sound somewhat limited for even a secondary power.He seemed to read something in my expression, because he had further protests, “It’s really not that amazing.  I have to wait between each use of it, and it’s not something I can build a name or identity around.  The emotion power has no impact or visual side to it, so it’s out too.”“A few of the multi-triggers I’m aware of tend to have more… I’m not sure what the word is.  Esoteric or abstract names.  The one villain in my town was Circus.  The solution to a disparate set of powers is to just create something more out there that has its own identity, and then fit your powers to match, instead of trying to fit your identity to a random set of powers.”“Identity like what?”“Like… if you’re standing back and using your blaster power, maybe something like a warlock aesthetic.  You could have a robe, multiple arms, you’ve got your ‘magic’, both with the blaster power and the emotion one.”“No,” he said, quieter than before.  He stared at the board.  “Not like that. That’s not me and I don’t want to go there.”“Okay,” I said.  I folded my arms, looking at the names he’d put down.  “If you like video games… is there an aesthetic or character or kind of game you could tap into?”“I’d be worried about choosing something I get tired of a month from now.”“Just…” I started, trying to think of a good argument.  “Just as a starting point, to get you thinking.”“The space opera game I got from Chris, one of the things he gave me to keep me sane when I’m out in the middle of nowhere and I don’t want to bother Erin.  Chris, what’s the Void class I played, the worker one?”“There are three.  Miner, welder, and rigger.  You played either of the last two.”Rain nodded to himself, then looked at the board.He started to write something down.  He got as far as Rig when I said, “Rigger and Rig are taken.”Rain threw down the marker and he clenched both his tinker and regular hands into fists.  “Son of a…”“Sorry to be the bearer of bad news,” I said.“What does it matter?” Tristan asked.  He was still hanging with Chris at the one end of the room.  “Names are taken, so what?  It’s not like there’s a system out there enforcing that stuff.  Kenzie could call herself Optics, it’s not like there’s a PRT.”“I don’t want to though,” Kenzie said.  “It gets complicated.”“Okay, but for the sake of argument,” Tristan said.  “Why couldn’t she if she wanted to?”“Rigger or Rig could still be alive,” I said.  “And we don’t know what’s going to happen in the future with people picking up where the PRT left off.  Finding a good name and identity you’re comfortable with is hard, and capes tend to be protective of their names as a result.  Mix-ups and headaches used to be common and we don’t want to go there.  People travel to your town to literally fight you over a name.”“I’m still not sold on the PRT issue,” Tristan said.  “They’re gone.  They aren’t coming back.”“The remnants of them are.  Organizations using their files and methods.  A military-esque group following the rules and regulations of the PRT’s code of justice.  There are headaches involved.”There was a knock at the door.  Sveta started toward it, but Kenzie leaped out of her chair and beat her to it, opening the door.Kenzie saluted as Ashley entered.  Ashley had a plastic bag with books and her dress in it.  She moved those things out of the way, holding them while Kenzie fished the two camera drones out of the bottom of the bag.“Good work,” Tristan said.  “Lawyer-person left some tips, but I liked a lot about how you handled that.”“It was very natural,” I said.  “You’ll probably like the headaches you gave them, putting them on the spot like you did.  Kenzie got some of their conversation after.”Ashley smiled.“How was the train ride?” Sveta asked.  “You might have to go back and forth a bit, I hope it isn’t too boring.”“It was fine.  I read a book.  A baby cried after looking at me and I was amused.”“A baby cried?” Tristan asked.“I look intimidating, apparently.”“Or it cried because it’s a baby,” Chris said.  “Babies cry about everything.  They’re stupid like that.”“It cried because of me,” Ashley said.  “I’ve made enough people cry to know when it’s because of me.”Chris shrugged.  “I’ll defer to the expert.”“It could be because you’re different,” Kenzie said.  “The first house I was in growing up, there were mostly only black people in my neighborhood, and I remember my aunt had a baby and the baby cried whenever he saw a white person.  It might be like that.  Except you’ve got the cool eyes and hair.”“On that topic,” Ashley said.  “Eye.  Mine’s bothering me.”“Oh, sure, I’ll get it,” Kenzie said.  She ran to her desk, then ran back to Ashley, who bent down, one hand on Kenzie’s shoulder.Sticking a pair of tweezers into Ashley’s eye, Kenzie grabbed and withdrew the camera.  It had a flat head like a nail, but the camera’s body more closely resembled a pin in how thin and long it was, with wires encircling its length in a double-helix.I winced a little, watching it come out.  Ashley didn’t seem to mind.“I can’t stand that,” Sveta said.  “Maybe it’s because eyes are one of the only things I have, but eeesh.”She rattled a bit as she shuddered or mimed a shudder.“It’s phased out, you wimps,” Kenzie said.  “It’s not actually stabbing anything.  It treats the eye as a portal and a model and unfolds in non-space using that framework.”“I felt it moving around,” Ashley said.“It’s mostly not actually stabbing anything,” Kenzie corrected her statement.  “One to three percent in reality at most, stabbing at things.  Sorry.  I’ll fine tune the phase.  It might be responding to your power.”“I have regular appointments with someone who can give me a replacement if you destroy my eye,” Ashley said.  “I’m not worried.  I trust you.”“Awesome,” Kenzie said, wiping the camera-pin with a tissue.I wasn’t sure it was ‘awesome’.  I knew who that person was.  Bonesaw.“We watched what we could before you left and the flying cameras ran out of battery,” I said.  “Then we talked about plans and did some homework.”“Thinking about names,” Rain said.“Rude jokes about names too,” Chris said.  “Tristan had a good one.”“Glad I missed that,” Ashley said.“You have a board, just so you know,” Kenzie said.  “You can make notes.”“I’m fine,” Ashley said.  “What plans were you talking about?”“We wanted to wait until you were here to do anything,” I said.  “Tattletale’s a persistent issue.  She’s lurking in the background, and she’s hard to shake.  Instead of having her looming, it might be nice to rattle her a bit.  It might be possible to do it in a way that doesn’t tip her off about who you guys are or how you’re operating.”“How?” Ashley asked.I explained, “Kenzie can call her old teammates.  We’ll offer an exchange.  A favor for a favor.  We know that the people in Cedar Point are easily spooked.  This is new, untested ground, and thanks to you, we know that Prancer is the closest thing they have to a boss and he’s inexperienced.  We can put them on the back foot.”“I’ll give you the transcript and a recording so you can check it out on your own time,” Kenzie told Ashley.“Back foot?” Ashley asked.“They’re easily spooked and Tattletale gave them free questions they can ask.  They’ve used some already, and they might have used them all,” I said.  “So… we leverage hero groups and some secondary people.  They do a one-loop patrol or light investigation, show their faces.”“Pressure,” Tristan said.  “Part of why you patrol in the first place, but we’re using other people.”“We can apply pressure on our own,” Ashley said.  “We have me, and we have Chris.”“The law student said you should back off a bit,” Sveta said.  “You did a good job of being intimidating and believable.  It would be better if we stirred the pot some, let them focus on other things, heat dies down.  There’s less of a chance they’ll investigate you if they’re focused on heroes.”I jumped in, “Seeing how you were in Prancer’s face, I think it might be better to have you keep doing that, than to have you inexplicably be nicer or calmer.  We just drop you back into Cedar Point when they’ve already got their hands full, you get to make them miserable and blindside them.  They might even turn to you for help.”“And that gives us power,” Ashley said.“And we have a trump card,” Tristan said.  “The recording of the conversation with Tattletale.  That’s endgame stuff, but if it turns out she’s digging and she’s on our trail anyway, we can use it to mess with her.  We can give them the impression she wanted us to pressure them so they’d use questions and keep buying her services.”Ashley smiled.Hm.  Maybe not the best thing if Ashley was that pleased with my idea.I decided I had her on board and I had her playing nice.  Time to sell her on the more cautious, moderated part of things.  “We play this slow, but we can maintain power, we can put them on the back foot, and we have a way of screwing up one of the major players on the bad guy’s side.  That last one is the kind of thing we’ll want to consult outside parties for.  Tip off the Wardens or one of the big teams that we’re messing with Tattletale, in case they want that to coincide with something else they’ve got going on.”“More people involved is more chances a spy gives up the wrong info,” Chris said.“Very true,” I said.  “That’s where it’s good to make it so we’re only calling people we know and trust.  Former teammates.  I think we can reasonably assume the likes of Chevalier are fairly legit.  Others, we control the information we give them.  We do this smart.”“I like it,” Ashley said.“I can call my old teammates,” Kenzie said, collapsing back into her computer chair.  She put the eyeball-pin camera into a jewelry box.  “I don’t know if they’ll say yes, but I can try.”“If everything else falls through, I can call Weld and ask if he knows people,” Sveta said.“There are options,” I said.  “I met some people at the community center.  They might help me out.”“I know people too,” Ashley said.  “From my appointments.  I can try asking when I next run into them.”“You’re sure?  You actually have hero friends?” Tristan asked.“No.  But they’re heroes other people trust to work with someone like me, we talk, and I can exchange favors with them.”“That’s awesome,” Sveta said.“I’ll call mine, first?” Kenzie asked.The others agreed.  Chris was still in the corner with his phone and comic, and Tristan walked over to grab him, wheeling him to the center of the room so he’d participate.  Chris did crack a smile at that.“Still feeling that hit of joy from the other day?” Rain asked.“Indulgence, not joy.  I’m indulging myself or other people if I smile.”“Shhhh!” Kenzie shushed people.  “I’m on the phone.”There was a pause.“Hi, Houndstooth,” she said.Pause.“I found it online.”Pause.  Sveta used the break in Kenzie speaking to shoot me a worried look.“It’s technically online.  It didn’t take much to figure it out.”Pause.“No, I don’t want to bother you.  I’m part of a different team now and we’re doing our thing.  Yeah.  We’re calling people we know and trust and exchanging favors for favors, and I thought I’d ask you, since you seemed like you might be interested based on how the last conversation went.”Pause.“I thought it went okay,” Kenzie said, smiling and rolling her eyes.Pause.“It’s fine.  Really.  I’m not-”Pause.“Okay,” she said.  She pulled the phone away from her ear.  “Houndstooth wants to talk to the person in charge of the group.”I saw Ashley and Tristan exchange looks.“I hate phones,” Ashley said.Tristan reached for the phone.“Houndstooth.  I’m Capricorn.  Yeah.  Team Reach.  Group of six with a coach that’s a partial member, kind of.”He glanced at me as he said it, and I shrugged.“Everyone’s here.  We’ve got a thing going on, we were thinking of cooperating with other groups.  Can I put you on speaker?”There was a pause.Kenzie turned around, and hit a key on her keyboard.An image appeared in the center of our group, and most of us backed away.A still image of a person.  He had a sleek, Anubis-like helmet or mask that encapsulated his head.  His actual outfit was sleek as well, but Western.  Nothing of an actual houndstooth pattern, ironically.“You’re on speaker, I think,” Tristan said.“Hi guys,” Houndstooth said.  He sounded more adult than ‘kid’.  “I’ve got to admit, I’m wary.”“Understandable.  I get that this comes out of nowhere,” Tristan said.  “Listen, this is a take-it-or-leave-it thing, we’re fine if you decide it’s too much of a question mark and pass.  Offer is a favor for a favor.  There’s an area we’re interested in, and we’re hoping to get some other people showing up there, patrols.  Maximizing pressure and seeing what we can shake up.”“What area?”“Can’t say until you agree, but it’s not too dangerous.”“I can think of a few places it could be, especially if you’re a new team operating in open jurisdictions.  New Brockton, or one of the Fallen camps, big or small.”Kenzie wrote something down.  She held up the paper.he’s smart“Less dangerous than that, even,” Tristan said.“We show up, we… patrol, make our presences known.  What’s the fallout?”“Twenty percent chance they pick a fight?” Tristan asked.  He looked around at the group.“Ten at most, and only if you stick around.  I visited and they took half an hour before showing their faces,” Ashley said.  “They won’t go for the jugular, either.  Worst case is they bruise your pride.”“I’m feeling more like this is one of those places the B-listers are moving to, now.”“No comment,” Tristan said.“Yeah,” Houndstooth said.  “And we can call in a favor in exchange?  What sort?  You patrol somewhere or help us pull off a complicated arrest?”Kenzie pointed to herself.“We’ve got Optics, who’s not calling herself Optics anymore, for one thing,” Sveta spoke up.“You’re lucky,” Houndstooth said.  Kenzie sat up straighter.“…but I’m thinking in other directions.”  Houndstooth finished.  Kenzie slouched in her seat.“What kind of directions?” Tristan asked.“I’m thinking.  Capricorn, can I hold onto this favor without naming it?”Tristan looked around.  There were a few nods.  Tristan said, “Sure.  That was my original take on how this would go.  The others seem cool with that.  I’ll give you my phone number.”Tristan gave his number.  There was a break while Houndstooth took it down.“If you’re game, I think we can let you know where we’re thinking of,” I said.  The others nodded, so I added, “Cedar Point.  Hollow Point in villain vernacular.”“You know,” Houndstooth said.  “It bothered me that it wasn’t being looked after.”“That was my feeling too,” I said.“Who’s speaking, can I ask?”“Victoria Dallon.  I used to be Glory Girl, and I’m the coach, so to speak.”“I know the name.  Hi.  You’re wanting to rattle these guys?”“That’s the basic idea,” I said.“Basic idea?  Even before you said that, I had the impression there was a less basic part to the idea.  Am I right about there being more to this?”“Some.  Nothing that impacts you negatively,” I said.Tristan spoke up, “We’re hoping to tap some others, maintain pressure, and hold off on getting personally involved until we know how much reach these guys really have.”“They’re bit players.  This thing happens now and again.  It tends to self-combust.”Tristan looked at me.Passing the ball to me?  I said, “We know how much reach they probably have, and there’s some.”“Interesting.”I went on, “Personally speaking, I don’t want this to combust.  Some skirmishes are probably inevitable, but these guys aren’t, as was said earlier, going to go for the jugular.  I want to keep it limited to that.”“I don’t want to see any places combusting either.  If you think it’s safe and if you want to help save Cedar Point, I think I can sell my team on a patrol or two.”“That’d be great,” Tristan said.“If something happens and we get in over our heads, you back us up or call the bigger names?”“Of course,” Tristan said.  “Probably the latter.  We’ve got kids and stuff, and we’ve been urged on multiple fronts to keep on the down-low.”Ashley looked annoyed at that.“Alright,” Houndstooth said.  “Hm.  I know another team that might be okay doing something similar, if you’re wanting to get others on board.  I can put you in touch with them, but I’d want a minor favor.  One I already have in mind.”“If they’re trustworthy and won’t spill our role in things or why people are showing interest in Cedar Point.  What’s the favor?”“They are trustworthy.  Before I commit my team, I want to meet you guys face to face.  Grab a coffee or something.  Glory Girl and Capricorn and whoever else is in a leadership position.”Kenzie sunk further in her seat, so low her head couldn’t roll backward off the back of the chair.  Instead, she slid to one side, her head closer to the armrest.  She indicated herself, pointing, eyes rolling back so the whites showed.“I think that should be fine,” Tristan said.  He looked at Kenzie, and she nodded, exaggerated.  “Yeah.  That’s good.”“Great.  The team I’m thinking of is Auzure.  Corporate.”“I know them,” I said.  “I’m not sure they’re my top choice.”“I don’t recommend them lightly,” Houndstooth said.  “They’re by-the-book, serious, they’re strong for a small team, they stick to their word, and they’re looking for opportunities to get out there.”“That last bit is what concerns me,” I said.  “They’re looking for exposure and this team wants more subtlety.  We want the villains in Cedar Point wondering why heroes are there and tapping their resources.”“And you get to see what resources they have.”“Basically,” I said.“You keep using that word and I keep realizing you’ve really got a plan. Okay.  I think I like this.  Auzure is out, then?  That’s your gut feeling?”“Can I put you on mute while I confer?” I asked.  “I’m just the coach, I don’t want to make decisions.”“Yep.”Kenzie sat up and hit a key on her keyboard.  A red ‘x’ appeared over the mouth and ears of the hologram image of Houndstooth.Really weird that she had that, I noted.“What’s up?” Tristan asked.“I interviewed for Auzure.  They were just a bit sleazy.  Greedy.  Their reason for interviewing me was to get at my family, just as one example of a red flag that came up.  My feeling is if you guys bring them in, they’ll try to do something flashy or get more involved than you want them.”“If that’s the case, I’d rather avoid them,” Sveta said.“They sound like the bad kind of corporate team,” Tristan said.  “But I might be biased.  Okay.  Any thoughts?  Objections?”“We could use them in a limited capacity,” I said.  “Have them make a phone call, instead of actually showing up.”“Phone call?” Rain asked.“Yeah.  Can I just see what Houndstooth says to this?”“Sure,” Tristan said.  “Unmute.”“Houndstooth,” I said.“I’m here.”“In the interest of keeping Auzure involved in only a limited capacity, what if we had them call someone and ask about renting space?  No commitment, just see if the person reports it to the villains in town.  The villains would probably stress over the notion.”“Stress you want.  Yeah.  Could work.”“Ideally, we’d ask Auzure to call when Auzure is busy.”“You don’t want them in your jurisdiction?”“…Yeah.”  I said.  I almost said ‘basically’.“I hear you.  Yeah.  I think they’ve got something going on right now.  Rumors of war on the horizon.  Earth C.  If you used them in the next week, I don’t think they’d pick up on hints.”“We’d need to figure out who we want Auzure to call, so that the person called might tip off the villains.  It might be tight to get that information in a week, but yeah.”“You’ve got Kenzie.  I think you’ll do just fine on that front.”I looked at Kenzie, expecting her to perk up.  She smiled, but she didn’t really show much more enthusiasm at the praise.“We’ll have that face to face meeting,” Tristan said.  “We can hammer out particulars then.”“Yes.  I’ll call you after I’ve raised the idea with my team, and we’ll figure out a time to meet.  I’ll keep quiet on it being Cedar Point until they’re on board.”“Great,” Tristan said.  “I’ll let you go now.”“Alright.  Another day, Capricorn.”The phone call ended.“I like him,” I said.  I looked at Kenzie.  “Good recommendation.”“Yup,” she said.  “He’s going to want to dish out all the super embarrassing dirt on me from two years ago.  Uggh.”“We know the dirt,” Rain said.  “Most of us.”“Uugh,” Kenzie groaned.  “It’s like having friends over and your parents bringing out the photo album.  Except way, way worse, because I wasn’t a baby when I messed up with Houndstooth around, and it’s so much worse than being in the tub or having food on my face.”“We know your history, we know you’ve made great strides,” Sveta said.  “I can’t speak for the others, but to me, you’re about those strides and those successes.  You’re not defined by your worst days.”“Uuuuuuggh,” Kenzie said.“Right?” Sveta pressed.“Yeah,” Kenzie said.“It didn’t sound like that call was easy to make.  If Houndstooth is on the up-and-up, then it was a really, really good recommendation,” I said.“He is.  He’s one of the best true-blue heroes I know,” Kenzie said, smiling a little.“Two teams we can use to apply some pressure and get Cedar Point to reach out to Tattletale,” Tristan said.“Even if they catch on, they’ll be left wondering.  Heroes on your turf aren’t something you can ignore.  Ignoring that makes you look weak,” Ashley said.I nodded.And one way or another, we would strain the relationship with this group and Tattletale, and make them less likely or able to call on her when we made our play.This worked.Kenzie stood from her seat, walking over to her board.  She began copying down a redacted version of the scribbled-down tinker notes from before.She was bothered, that much was clear.  Now she was stepping away to dwell on the tinker stuff.  That didn’t seem like the worst thing in the world.On one wall, the one operating camera drone was showing a view of Cedar Point.  Sunny, largely abandoned, and a little rough around the edges, covered in graffiti with broken things here and there from a riot or protest that hadn’t been cleaned up after.The group was talking amongst themselves, about what needed to be done and arranged.“Rain’s thing needs some attention,” Tristan said.“We can talk some about that tonight, and talk more tomorrow.  Offer for an escort stands, Rain.”“Nah,” he said.  “I don’t want to play that card yet.”“Kenzie said she could do some of the surveillance from home, but we’ll probably want to meet here if we meet,” Tristan said.  “Kenzie will be a regular.  I can come once in a blue moon.”“I’ll be here when I’m not there,” Ashley said.  “If I’m holding off, then I’ll be here for the next bit.”“Cool,” Kenzie said, turning.  She’d added something to the board.  ‘Name?  Look-see / Looksee’.’“I’ll be here too,” Chris said.  He’d stood from his chair and was walking around Kenzie’s desk, peering at the tinker stuff.  “Or around here.  Sometimes I just sit around outside or find a place to read comics or watch stuff on my phone.”I saw Kenzie nod to herself, glancing back over one shoulder at Chris.‘Cool’, she’d said.  I wasn’t sure it was.  I hadn’t quite anticipated this, but with people being where they were, with the older members helping Rain, Ashley being available for surveillance, it meant Kenzie and Chris and Ashley would be spending more extended periods of time together.Or, put another way, the ex-Slaughterhouse Nine member and the two ‘kids’ of the team.“I’ll stop in regularly,” I said.  “Keep an eye on things.”“Yep,” Sveta said.  “Rotate or something?  With overlap, because you and I need to hang out.”“Naturally,” I said, smiling.  She’d picked up on the same concerns I had.“A few of us here at any given time,” Tristan said.There was a bit more conversation, hashing out particulars of schedule, as well as who was available on what days.“I could stop in at Cedar Point.  They know I was poking my head in before, but there’s no reason to let them think I’m gone and dealt with,” I said.“You’ve got the hero itch,” Sveta said.“It’s not the hero itch,” I said.  “It’s that Tattletale told me to go away and it means something if I don’t.”“It’s the-”“Chris!” Kenzie raised her voice.Chris froze.  He was leaning close to her projector box.  Stuff was piled on top.“Do not touch my bag!” she said, way louder and more intense than was necessary.“Not touching a thing,” he said.  “Relax.”“I’m not going to relax!  Back off!”“What, is it going to blow up or something?” he asked, with a chuckle.Kenzie strode forward, through the group, “Step back and leave my stuff alone!”“I didn’t touch anything.  Really.”“Kenzie,” Sveta said.  “He didn’t touch anything.”“And stop saying my stuff is going to blow up!” Kenzie said, volume still raised.  She shot Chris a look and smiled.  “Pretty please?  It’s really not funny.”“That was my fault,” I said.  “I brought it up first.  I’ve dealt with tinkers and hyperdimensional tech makes me nervous.”“You’re fine,” Kenzie said.  “You’ve been cool.  I like you.  I have more mixed feelings about Chris.  And I have very strong feelings about things like my bag being messed with.”Chris threw his hands up, retreated to the chair that Tristan had initially brought to the edge of where everyone was standing, and kicked at the ground, wheeling himself back to his corner.I met Sveta’s eyes.  We communicated more or less telepathically: more supervision would be needed.Kenzie was now rummaging, gathering her stuff and getting it organized.  She had what looked like a gym bag, white with pink piping as trim, and big plastic zipper tabs.  She put stuff in it and then picked it up.“Want to have a chat, Kenz?” I asked.She drew in a deep breath and sighed heavily, bag held close.  “Fine.”“It’s not obligatory,” I said.“It’s fine.  Yes.  Chat.  You’re cool.  Some people aren’t.”“Referring to yourself?” Chris asked.“Not helping, Chris,” Tristan called out.I led Kenzie out the side door, to the fire escape that was the access to the mostly unfurnished apartment.  The air outside was far warmer than the air inside.  It was late in the afternoon.“Sorry,” Kenzie said.  She put her bag down on one corner of the fire escape, then leaned against the railing, looking down as she wound her foot around the strap.“It’s okay,” I said.“I’m really glad you’re here,” she said.  “And I kind of like that you don’t know all the bad stuff.”“You’re worried about what Houndstooth is going to say?”“I don’t like being embarrassed,” she said.  “And it’s really, really embarrassing.”I didn’t like standing over her, so I walked over to where the stairs met the little platform of rusty slats and sat down sideways with my back to the exterior wall of the building.  Not facing her directly, but I could comfortably look her way.“I hear you,” I said.  “I said it before, but I’m grateful you were willing to get closer to that territory to help everyone out.  I have things I don’t like thinking about or getting into and I know what it takes to go there.”“I didn’t even really think about it so it’s not all that,” Kenzie said.“Are you okay?” I asked.  “Is there anything I can do?”“Talking is good,” Kenzie said, eyes on where the strap was wound around her ankle and foot.  “You ever- have you ever been so humiliated that you wished the earth would open up and swallow you up?”“I think everyone has.  It’s part of being young, that you fumble your way through things.”“Urgh,” she said.  “I… I once embarrassed myself really, really badly.”“Yeah.”“And it wasn’t just one earth that split open but a multiverse of them.  I was so humiliated an alien actually noticed and reached between those earths and into my head.  And now I- everything’s messy and hard.”“Sveta and the others seem to think you’re doing better.”“I am.  I’m mostly good.  I backslide now and again, but I get a handle on things and I have people who help when I do.”“That’s good,” I said.  “That’s an achievement, especially when you’ve got an alien tied to you.  You’re swimming with an anchor around your waist, and you’ve reached the shallow water.  That’s incredible.”Kenzie nodded.  She didn’t smile.“He saw me not long after everything went wrong.  And then he saw me a while later when I joined his team and I wasn’t exactly great then either.  Even if he saw me at my best now I don’t know if he’d be able to look past all the bad he’s seen before.”“You might not be giving him enough credit,” I said.“Maybe,” Kenzie said.  “But I might be giving him just enough credit, and I might be really worried that this cool heroine who’s helping us out might see or hear about the bad and then she not be able to see past it, either.”“The others have heard some of it, haven’t they?”“From my mouth.  That’s different.”“They’ve heard it and they want you on their team.  They respect you.  Whatever happens, I don’t think Houndstooth can say anything that’s going to have more weight than what Sveta says, because Sveta’s awesome and I respect her a ton.”“She’s great,” Kenzie said, staring down at her feet.  “She’s the best.”“And,” I said, pausing.  “Whatever he says, I don’t think it should have more weight than what you say, either.  Not when people like Sveta trust and respect you and I trust and respect her.  Okay?”Kenzie sniffed.  A slightly runny nose, now.  She wasn’t crying that I could see, but she might’ve been close.“Can I give you a hug?” I asked.“No,” She said.  She stooped down and picked up her bag.  She craned her head around, and looked through the window.The window was opaque, the surface blurred.  Kenzie’s tech, I realized.“Come,” Kenzie said.  Bag in her arms, she hauled the door open, and held it for me as I followed.The others were watching.  Sveta was on her way to the door, no doubt to let us know what was going on.Two people were in the center of the camera’s focus, walking down the streets of Cedar Point.I recognized one as Snag, and I could guess the other was the woman of Rain’s cluster.Rain turned his head, looking at me.I had an idea of what he was going to ask.  He couldn’t leave this opportunity to get information alone.  He couldn’t afford to.                                                                                           Shade – 4.3                                                                                           It was Sveta who said it, not Rain.  “If they go inside, we’re going to lose track of what they’re saying.”“Have they said anything yet?” I asked.“No,” Rain said.  “The woman doesn’t talk so it would be a one-sided conversation.  If they’re here, they’re here for something.  I want to know what.”“Anything you guys do risks blowing your surveillance,” I said.  “You might gain more information if you leave it alone.  Just saying.”“I might miss something vital,” Rain said.“You might,” I said.  “It’s really up to you guys.  If you need help, I’ll back you up.”Tristan walked forward, and half-sat on the desk, head turned so he could keep one eye on the image.  “Hypothetically, if we did act on this, what would we be doing?  Picking a fight?”“We could,” Ashley said.  “Rain said they were injured and needed maintenance.  It would be timely, it would keep them injured and out of the picture.”“On their turf?” Tristan asked.  “With who knows how many villains in the immediate area?”“And it would blow our surveillance, like Victoria said,” Sveta said.“You’ve been quiet on why they’re after you, Rain,” Chris said.  “You never talked about your trigger event.”“As a rule, it’s not good to ask people about their trigger events,” Sveta said.“As a rule,” Chris said, “It’s vital information about who we’re fighting and why they’re doing what they’re doing.”“Chris,” Sveta said.“Sveta,” Chris said.  “Detach from your emotions, focus more on their emotions.  Are they passionate?  Driven?  Is it personal?  If any or all of the above are true, it changes the rules of how they act.  They might act even if they are injured or needing to do some maintenance.”“People don’t act by rules,” Tristan said.“Some people do,” Chris said.  “Byron does, or did, based on what you said.  They might.  But we need more of what Rain knows about who and what they are and where they come from to know that.”Kenzie turned around in her seat.  “I was just telling Victoria I didn’t like the idea of her prying into my past or where I come from.  It would feel pretty gross and unfair if we pushed Rain to do it now, when he obviously doesn’t want to.”“Hypocritical might be the word you’re looking for,” I said.“I’m learning so many words today,” Kenzie said.“Putting all that aside, is there any way to listen in, if they went inside?” Rain asked.  “They’re a block away from where Prancer went before.  If they go there, what can we do?”“I could rig something,” Kenzie said.  “But it would be fragile and iffy.”“I can’t help but notice we’re changing the subject,” Chris said.“Look.  Just- I need this,” Rain said.  “I’ve told Tristan everything and I’ve told Sveta some of it.  If Tristan thinks it needs to be said, he can say it.  He’s more objective.  But I really want to know what they might say, I want to start making preparations now.”“I’ve been keeping my mouth shut,” Tristan said.  “I’m in a weird place, knowing what I do, not wanting to betray a friend.  I feel like if I said anything at all, even if the reasons were good, it would still be betraying Rain.”“I can take apart things,” Kenzie said.  “Kludge it together for an emergency thing.  It won’t take long but we’d need Sveta to hurry over there to plant it and that’ll take a few minutes.  If that’s what we’re doing.  I don’t want to break my things down if we’re not doing this, though. ”“I’m probably going to regret saying this, but I’ll stand up for Kenzie,” Chris said.  “It’s going to be shitty if she starts taking apart good work so she can get it done in time, and then Rain doesn’t hold up his end any.  That’s not fair and it’s going to lead to resentment.”“I don’t care about fair,” Kenzie said.  “But thank you, Chris.”“Don’t thank me.”“I’m going to anyway.  It means a lot.”“No it doesn’t.  I just don’t want the headaches,” Chris said.  “And Rain is being the biggest headache on the team.  Maybe except for me, but I don’t have anyone trying to kill me and I’m not really asking for anything, so I think I can get away with it.”Rain ran his fingers through his hair, turned and took a step to one side, like he was going to walk away or pace, and then stopped, because he couldn’t take his attention off the screen.Tristan was in a hard place, knowing what he did but having a friendship on the line, Sveta maybe wasn’t as much of a friend to Rain but she was also more sensitive and kind, and she didn’t know as much.  Rain didn’t really have other allies in the group he could turn to.  Certainly not Ashley.  Not Chris.  Kenzie just wanted to know if she should get started building her thing.Somehow, he ended up looking at me.  He looked spooked.“If Kenzie builds the thing, I can fly over and plant it,” I said.  “I don’t mind showing my face there, it fits with the plan, there’s a lower risk of the surveillance operation getting discovered, it works.”Rain nodded, tense.“But I do think Chris may be right.  If the group is extending a hand to you and you’re not extending trust back, that may not be fair.  You should share something.”“Okay,” Rain said.Kenzie spun around.  She grabbed one of her flying eyes and pried open the side, pulling out a black rectangle.  She swapped it with a spare.“It’s personal,” Rain said.  “It’s emotional.  Not helped by the dreams, by the possible personality bleed across the cluster.  Some things I’ve caught lately made me think there might be some.”I listened, my expression still, arms folded, mostly watching what Kenzie did while Rain talked.  I was going to have to deploy this thing.Kenzie popped open the jewelry case with the camera she’d put in Ashley’s eye, then tore off the section under the lens.  She flicked at parts with her fingers to get them spinning and then held onto others, unscrewing them in the process.“They blame me, for the events around the trigger.  I’ve told Sveta all of this.  The dreams are biased, selective, cherry picking from my perceptions.  They make me out to be more of a bad guy than I am.”“I don’t think you’re a bad guy at all,” Tristan said.“I’m not a good guy either.  And maybe that’s because of the bleed coming the other way.  I feel like a completely different person than I was then.  And I know – I think Snag is too.  I’ve seen his perspective and his dreams, and he’s willing to murder now?  Maybe the agent took half of my anger from back then and divided it among them, aiming it back at me.”“What happened?” Ashley asked.“I fucked up.  I had a chance to save them and I didn’t,” Rain said.I looked away from where Kenzie was spinning things to screw in the eye-camera beneath the major lens of the flying eye, looked at Rain, and saw how miserable he was.“How does Erin fit in?” Sveta asked.“She doesn’t.  She knows the story but she hasn’t seen the dreams.  I think if she saw the dreams like the three members of the cluster did, she’d hate me too.  But she doesn’t.”“And ‘of 5?'” Chris asked.I turned my head.“My username, online,” Rain explained.  “I don’t know what happened to the fifth.  It’s complicated.  I can think of a few people it might be.  People that didn’t make it.”Kenzie turned around.  The camera looked worse for wear.  I realized it was the nice one, with the adaptive camouflage or whatever it was.  Panels were missing and wires exposed.  She beckoned me to approach.  I did.“Put the lens side against the wall or the roof.  There’s a plunger on the side here, you see?”In a groove along the side, normally meant to aid in aerodynamics or something, the metal rod ran flush with the body.“I see,” I said.  I looked at the screen.  They’d walked past the place where Prancer had gone inside.“Put it up against the surface, then slowly, super slowly push that in.  There’s no resistance built in, so you could push it in in half a second if you weren’t careful.”“What would happen?”“We’d lose it.  That’s four days worth of work and the eye camera is six days worth of work, and some of those parts were hard to get.  Please don’t push it in fast.”“How slow do I depress it?”“Um.  Take, like, a minute, to get it from here to here, if you can.  Be ready to stop if I tell you to.”“How are we communicating?”“Phone?” Kenzie asked.“Phone,” I said.  “Got it.”I checked I had my phone with me, that it had battery, and then got my earbuds, plugging them into the phone and then putting one into my ear.  I collected the football-sized camera.“Give me something to eat?” I asked.  “Granola bar or something?”Chris walked over to his bag, fished for something, and then tossed me a bag of chips.  I caught it, then caught the paper-wrapped meal he threw my way.  I put everything into a bag.  My mask, computer and notebook were in the bag already, which was good.“It’s not kiss-kill,” Rain said.  “Or, like Victoria said a few days ago, it’s kiss-kill with good cover.  I’m weaker than them, and the dreams give them a reason to hate me.”“I’m good to go?” I asked.“I think so.  Thanks for doing this,” Sveta said.I gave her a pat on the shoulder as I passed.“Thank you,” Rain said, with sincerity.I was at the door when Tristan said, “Might not need the camera after all.”I looked back.They hadn’t gone indoors.  They were in a parking lot.  A group of people was standing around a van.  They had masks on.“I’m still going to go,” I said.  “We don’t know where they’ll go or what they’ll do.  Patch me in somehow?”“I’ll video call you,” Kenzie said.  “We’ll talk to you and you can look at your phone to see what’s happening.”“Okay,” I said.  “That works.  That’s going to do a number on my monthly limit.  I might have to get an unlimited plan.”“They don’t have any of those anymore, not after the end of the world,” Kenzie said.  “I checked.  And they get peeved at me when I borrow anything, so I have to be really careful with my cameras and junk.”I could have responded, but I didn’t want to get stuck in a conversation.  I let myself outside, then flew from the top of the fire escape.Might have to have a conversation with the big hero teams to see if they have any options, I thought.  It would be nice to have the fancy earbuds that the Wards used to have, or just a special phone plan that let us handle higher-bandwidth operations.My phone rang in my ear, startling me even though I’d expected it.  I thumbed at my phone to answer it.  Rather than any of the others, it was the audio from Kenzie’s camera, observing the interaction between Snag and the group in the parking lot.“…Snag.  This is Love Lost,” Snag said.  Recognizable enough.  His voice was a deep growl.  That was his ordinary voice, it seemed.“Love Lost?  Shouldn’t it be No Love Lost?”There was a brief pause.“She doesn’t talk,” Snag said.“That might make negotiations hard.”“We’ll be fine,” Snag said.  “I’ll cover things.”“Your friend isn’t coming?  Cradle?”Cradle was the potential third, then.“He isn’t.  Just me, just her.”“I’m Secondhand, this is Last Minute, Final Hour, and End of Days.”Still flying, I pulled my phone from my pocket, being careful not to drop it.  I hated using my phone while airborne.  It was so easy to let my guard down.“Your name doesn’t match,” Snag said.“I don’t mind,” Secondhand said.I could see the image on my phone.  I made the reel gesture to zoom in on the one I wasn’t familiar with.  Tall, with an elongated face and head, bald, with an elaborate waxed mustache, and round sunglasses.  He wore suspenders over a shirt that was rolled up to the elbows.  The arms crossed over his chest were muscled.  A bit of a steampunk vibe, even though his clothes weren’t that old fashioned.The time manipulators had another teammate, then.“You wanted to meet.  Here we are,” Secondhand said.“We’re similar in how we approach things,” Snag said.  “Maybe we can trade, teach each other something.”“Maybe,” Secondhand said.  “Sounds good.”“Maybe the deal’s lopsided in your favor, but you give us a hand when we need it.”“Ah, I thought that was coming.  We heard you were recruiting.”“Mm hmm,” Snag made the sound, and it came off more like growl than agreement.“The more the merrier?” another member of the Speedrunner’s group asked.  It might have been End of Days.“The more the merrier,” Snag repeated, sounding the furthest thing from merry.“Why don’t you take a look and tell us what this means to you?” Secondhand asked.There was a pause.  I looked at my phone.  The back door of the van opened.  Snag approached, with the woman -Love Lost?- hanging a bit back.  She had curved claws at her fingertips and thumb, with a thin framework of rods and bands at the back of her hands to keep those claws in place.  She had more glittering around her feet and ankle.  A mask covered her lower face.“Victoria?” Sveta asked, through the phone.“What’s up?” I asked, holding the phone to my ear, so I could use the mouthpiece there.“Kenzie’s handling the camera and things.  I’m hanging back, Tristan’s close.  We’ll be your people, mostly.  Can you tell us anything about the Speedrunners?”I was glad I’d checked my books and notes.“Seattle.  B-list villains, but that’s partially because Seattle was setting a really high bar around the time they were active,” I said.  “Partially.  They’re time manipulators, but complicated by the fact that they have at least one tinker in the group.  It could be that they’re all tinkers.  A family thing like how forcefields run in my family.”“They don’t look like family,” I heard a voice.  It might have been Chris, or Rain speaking with a funny tone.  Probably Chris.“That’s what they’re talking about sharing, then,” I heard Tristan.  “Tinker know-how.”“Probably.  Um.  Each of them has a power, but they augment that by having tinker stuff they wear.  Secondhand can cover a lot of ground really fast, but can’t affect anyone or do much while he’s doing it.  Can’t hurt you, can’t move stuff, can’t set traps.  But we already talked briefly about him earlier.  He’s the one doing regular sweeps of the area, looking for trouble.  The tinker stuff he wears reduces the strain on his body and lets him operate like that for longer.  And it means that when he pops out of that mode, he does it with a boom.  It gives him some offensive ability.”“That doesn’t feel B-list,” Tristan said.“I’ll get to that momentarily.  I’m doing these guys out of order.  Final Hour, he has a targeted slow.  One target at a time, if he’s aware of them, he can slow them, as an ongoing thing.  He can swap it with a moment’s notice.  Tinker gear applies other effects to slowed targets.  Makes it so being slow also crushes you and makes it hard to breathe, or chills you.  Makes it so he can target a friend and make it so they fall slow, and reduce the impact of their landings.  He had a thing which screwed with-”“This works,” Snag’s growl interrupted me.  “I could do something with this, if I had time to study it.  I could use the engines you’ve got here to make emotion effects I channel through my tech last longer, or prolong battery life.”“Good,” Secondhand said.A pause.  A metal on metal sound.“What’s she saying?” Secondhand asked.“Love Lost likes that.  She thinks she could do something with it.  Right?  Yeah.”“Alright.  Doesn’t tell me much,” Secondhand said.  “How about you show us something?”“It’s damaged, but you should get the picture,” Snag said.I checked the phone.  He was using one of his overlong, mechanical arms to pull off his other arm, holding it out by gripping it at the midpoint, the shoulder near End of Days and the hand near Secondhand.It was my first clean look at the whole group of Speedrunners, as Kenzie zoomed in the camera.Secondhand was fairly normal in build, with goggles and a flat-top cap.  He managed to not look old-fashioned.Last Minute was shorter, stout, with a lot of muscle and fat both.  His gadgets hung from a high-tech belt.Final Hour was more muscular, with tech wrapped around one of his arms, ending in a blunt design that resembled a brass hairdryer, with red smoke pouring from the fans and vents along its length.  Aside from the brass helmet he wore, which covered his entire head the armor covered only half of his body.End of Days, well, I’d already gotten a look at him.  He wore a mask that wrapped around his head in a broad band, from eyebrow to cheekbone, with the black sunglasses on top of that, but it was hard to imagine how he’d be less recognizable when his facial shape, lack of hair, and mustache were all so apparent.“Keep going,” Tristan said.Where had I been?  Final Hour, right.  “He could attach an EMP thing to his slow that slightly hampered powers, made machinery grind to a halt.  All through this oversized thing he wore that covered his arm and hand.”“He’s wearing it now,” Sveta said.“Okay, right, can’t see while I’ve got the phone to my ear.  Foresight said they were using Final Hour to mask their business dealings.  He was their heavy hitter and he might still be.  I was thinking he might be using the EMP thing or something like it to keep people from looking in.”“I hope they don’t use it,” Kenzie said.“Probably wouldn’t work outdoors,” I said.  “Last Minute moves things backward in time.  Emphasis on things.  Not people.  Carries an assortment of tinker boomerangs, bombs, weapons.  If Secondhand didn’t have the tinker-ish name, and if there wasn’t a chance they were all lesser tinkers, I’d say Last Minute was a contender for the team’s tinker, with his arsenal.”“What’s the catch, or what’s the tinker component?” Tristan asked.“From what little I remember, his gadgets don’t act the same when moving in reverse, or it has added functionality while being reversed.”“Fuck me,” someone said.  I thought I heard someone else groan, too.“Yeah.  Boomerangs fly a different path, or split apart so one version carries forward and one retraces its path,” I said.  “That sort of thing.”I’d slowed while flying, and now I stopped.  I didn’t want to enter the territory and draw attention when it wasn’t quite time.  I had a sense of what Birdbrain and Braindead did, and there was a risk Secondhand would do a patrol when the meeting concluded, to see what their potential business partners were doing.I settled on a roof, walking as I landed, then stopping to stand on the corner of the roof.  Cedar Point was on the other side of the water, on a peninsula across from me.“End of Days?” Tristan asked.“I don’t have a clue,” I said.  “Nothing about name or appearance stands out to me.”“Fuck,” I heard a voice.  Rain, I was guessing.“Why are they B-list?” Tristan asked.  Not the first time he’d touched on that.“Because the tinker stuff is limited.  The batteries take time to charge,” I said.  “When they were active in Seattle, they had something like twenty days between the jobs they pulled, and they had weaknesses.  The batteries ran out if engagements were prolonged and once that happens they lose a lot of their muscle.”“They might have recruited End of Days to cover that weakness,” Tristan said.“Yeah,” I said.  “It’s not out of the question.”The Speedrunners took longer to examine Snag’s arm than Snag had taken to examine whatever they’d shown him.  I watched through my phone, grieved a bit for my monthly limits, and waited.On the screen, Love Lost stepped away from the meeting, walking down the length of the parking lot.  She stood with her back to the group, hands at her sides, fingers and claws spread.“I like her,” Ashley said.  “Good style.  It’s going to be a shame to smash her face in.”“If we engage her,” Sveta said.  “If we even go that far.”“Of course,” Ashley said.“What’s she doing?” I asked, more to myself than to the group.It took a few more seconds, but someone walked down the street.  A woman with a purple hood and antlers.Prancer’s partner.“Love Lost saw her coming,” Tristan said.“Sensed,” I corrected.“The woman- Love Lost, she has the emotion aspect of the power,” Rain said.  “Maybe it includes some emotion sense.  Detecting people.”“If so, I’m glad I didn’t just drop in nearby,” I said.Velvet said something.  The camera didn’t catch it.“Sorry!” Kenzie said.  “Sorry!  I didn’t have the sound camera turned that way.  It’s finnicky.”“Don’t turn it toward those two, stay focused on Snag’s group,” Tristan said.  “Velvet’s already walking away.”“It was brief,” Rain said.  “I think she’s just checking on things, making sure it’s all peaceful.”Love Lost rejoined the group.“What did the queen of Hollow Point want?” Secondhand asked.Love Lost was silent.“Right.”“Are you done with my arm?” Snag asked.“Oh, yes.  Go ahead.”“Mm.”“I have a question, and it’s one I’d regret not asking,” Secondhand said.  “Who are you with?”“With?” Snag asked.  “Ourselves.”“I’ll elaborate.  We’ve got a few cliques forming already.  Bitter Pill in charge of the brains, watching, listening, planning the longer-term plays.  Not necessarily here, mind you.  Could be jobs elsewhere.”“Mm hmm.”“Beast of Burden in charge of the hostiles, the ex-cons, ex-birdcage, ex-covert military, ex-cage fighters.  The ones who are good or even eager when it comes to hurting people.”Snag commented, “We’ve had conversations with a few of them already.  Beast of Burden included.  We’re looking for people who are good or even eager to deliver the hurt.”“Great.  We’ll keep that in mind.  Final clique worth talking about, you’ve got Prancer in charge of the organization side of things.  The diplomacy, recruitment, and a lot of the lower-key, ongoing business.”“And?”“And I don’t think we’re going to divide up into factions and end up fighting each other.  I say clique because like attracts like and sooner or later, you’ll get pulled into one of the major groups.  Each serving a role.”“We’re our own group,” Snag said.  “We don’t care what clique you belong to.  You want access to our stuff to study and see what you can learn?”“We’d have to talk about it among ourselves, but I think we’re leaning that way.”I looked at the phone, as the Speedrunners exchanged looks.“Yeah,” Secondhand said, after assessing the others.  “Let’s assume we’re good to go forward with this, but we won’t set anything in stone until my friends and I have had a conversation.“Preliminary offer: we pay you fifteen thousand dollars, and we give you access to our tech for study,” Snag said.  “You give us access to your tech, and you lend us a hand when the time comes.”“For this job you’re planning?”“If you want to discuss it, I can invite others who’ve pledged to help.  We’ll discuss in one of Prancer’s venues.”“Maybe.  We’d have to talk it over.  What timeline?”“Soon,” Snag said.  “Anything more should wait for the discussion.”“How difficult?”“Hard to say.  I don’t want to tell you something and have it reach the wrong ears, and there are a lot of wrong ears.”“Give us some idea.”“Eight or nine young people with powers, is our best guess.  Mostly teenagers.  We don’t know who else, or what the exact number of adult capes, allies, or other resources they might have.  Teenagers are easiest to track, because they move more.”Someone spoke, and I had to view my phone to check who it was.  Last Minute.  “Hard to say?  That sounds easy to say.  A minimum of eight or nine people with powers is difficult.”“With the recruitment we’re planning, we’ll outnumber them three to one,” Snag said, in his characteristic growl.“You’re talking people with powers?  Not mooks, not henchmen?”“People with powers.  All going well, we’ll have them outnumbered three to one even if they call in help.”“Pulled from Cedar Point?”“Pulled from many places.  We have a thinker contact and that contact is calling in friends.  This contact and their friends are capes with names you’ve heard of, that everyone has heard of.  We have Lord of Loss committed to the job.  We have one or two others of similar caliber who may or may not participate, but who will contribute meaningful resources if they don’t show up personally.”“You don’t do things by half measures,” Secondhand said.“We don’t believe in half measures,” Snag said.  “In the bigger job, or in our deal with you.  Tech for tech, fifteen thousand for the job, but I’d like the two things bundled together.  We establish a working relationship and even a mutual dependency before the job starts.”“Mutual dependency?”“A reason for people to second guess themselves before wondering if they can drop away at the last minute and they won’t be missed because the crowd is big enough.  It was known to happen at events like Endbringer fights, before Gold Morning.”“Speaking for myself, not having consulted the group…”“Of course.”“I don’t mind that approach.  We’d have to discuss the money.  Spread across a four person team, it doesn’t amount to that much.”“When I did the community center job…” Snag started.  He paused, letting the statement hang.“You did it with stipulations and expectations.  Stipulations handled, expectations met,” Secondhand said.  “We’re aware.”“That counts for something,” Last Minute said.  “It needed doing, and it was done well.”“Trust that we intend to do this well,” Snag said.  “The three of us have spent a year steadily working toward this.  If you want more money, we could discuss it.  We’d want references to justify it, a guarantee you’ll earn your keep.”“I think we could manage that.  Instead of money, though…”“Hmm?”“Cradle.  He’s your best tinker?”“He can be.”“Maybe you sweeten the pot.  Include his work.”“That can be arranged.  You give us your references and recommendations in exchange.”“Alright.  I like the sound of that.  We’ll talk.”“Good,” Snag said.Secondhand put out a hand.  Snag reached out with his giant mechanical hand, enclosing it around Secondhand’s hand and forearm.They all shook hands.  Snag’s giant mechanical hand made for a peculiar image as it met Final Hour’s hair-dryer stub of a limb and the two shook.When steampunk-ish End of Days gingerly took Love Lost’s clawed hand in his bare hand, he bent down, kissing the back of it.  With her back to the camera, it was impossible to see her reaction.The Speedrunners split up into two groups, two getting into an older car, and two getting into the van with the tech in the back.Snag and Love Lost walked back the way they came.  Love Lost turned her head to watch as the cars pulled out of the parking lot and then drove past the pair of them.  The camera that was perched on the edge of the building slowly turned to follow the pair.As the camera zoomed in, the sound clarifying, the metal noises of Snag’s hands periodically touching the road and Love Lost’s claws clicking were very audible.Kenzie must have changed something, because the sound faded into the background.“Good?” Snag asked.Love Lost gave him a singular nod.“They’re good to have.  Versatile, and it’s good to have that tech.  I can think of ten things I could do with that.”Another nod.“You’re good for the meeting at the pub?”A final nod.“Pub,” I heard Tristan say.  “Kenzie?  Do we deploy Victoria?”“I have an address.  Only pub in Cedar Point, I think.  Across the street from where Prancer went inside.”I brought the phone up to my face.  “Love Lost might be able to sense people, and there’s Birdbrain and Braindead to account for.”“It’s up to you, Victoria,” Tristan said.  “But it would really, really help if we could get more of this kind of exchange.”I stepped off the roof, realized that someone was standing on the sidewalk on the far side of the street, staring at me, and saw the alarm on their faces.  I gave them my best heroic salute as I started flying instead of falling from the roof of the two-story building.“Ashley and Rain are kind of quiet,” I said, to the phone.“I don’t like phones, where I can’t see faces or reactions,” Ashley said.  “I’m fine.  This is good.”“I’m not so fine,” Rain said.Understandable.Right.  I’d maybe talk to him after, or encourage him to reach out to Yamada.  Even better, he could get around to making that call to the hero teams.But for now, going into enemy territory, I needed to look after myself and the mission.  I now needed to make prompt decisions for things that I’d hoped I’d have a few days or weeks to think about.“Radio silence unless it’s an emergency, or you need to tell me to stop deploying the camera, Kenzie,” I said.I heard a faint ‘boop’.No assistance, now.  Just me and my intel.  I put the white mask on.Primary concerns: Braindead and Birdbrain.  Clairvoyants both.Braindead was a tactical thinker, who could designate a set area in three dimensions, setting out a rectangular prism where he sensed everything in the area.  He could cover a small town with his power and have a general awareness of everything that happened in that town, but if he designated a smaller area, he got more clarity, more attention of simultaneous things at once, and he was aware of stats.  Non-numerical values for abstract things like physical wellness, martial combat capacity, and run speed, for everyone in the area.  Smaller area, more and more accurate stats.The drawback was that he was a twenty-something guy that spent an awful lot of time sitting in a chair with a diaper on, drooling, mumbling, and feeling acutely uncomfortable.  When his power was active, and for a time after, he was unable to act on his knowledge himself, or even to effectively defend himself.  He had been on the side of the good guys, once, which was why his power information was such common knowledge.  Something had changed or snapped.I flew just over the rooftops.  It wasn’t me flying at a height where I could pull my phone out, because there was a very real chance I could fly into something like a power line or chimney.Braindead’s power operated in three dimensions.  X, Y, Z.  A set area of north, south, east, west, up, and down.  If he wanted all of the stats and information, and if he wanted to minimize the other drawbacks of his power, like the recovery time, up and down were often the variable he could sacrifice.  He could cover an area three city blocks wide along the west-east axis and three city blocks long along the north-south axis, while only covering six to ten feet of up and down.Against Braindead alone, flying high and sticking to rooftops was a really safe bet, to stay out of his realm of awareness.Against Birdbrain, that was a weakness.  Birdbrain was a tactical clairvoyant of a complementary stripe to Braindead.  Top-down clairvoyant awareness, much like if Kenzie operated solely through tinker eyes-in-the-sky pointed straight down.  She also had thinker powers of another sort, worked into the main clairvoyant power, but she wasn’t an ex-hero, and the information wasn’t in files.She was really good with a gun, highly mobile, and thus she was very good at defending Braindead while he was incapacitated.If I stuck to rooftops, Birdbrain would detect me quickly.  If I went to the ground, I’d be in Braindead’s realm.I flew under things when I could, just to try to throw Birdbrain for a loop.  It took me a second to orient myself and find the buildings I was looking for, even when I knew they were part of the downtown strip.No sign of Snag or Love Lost.  They were already inside, I hoped.  With luck, I would be able to get the camera online shortly.I set down on the roof, my forcefield down, and put my bag down in the corner of the roof, against the raised lip.Fully aware that it was very likely that an eye in the sky was watching my every move, I used my body to block the view of the bag’s contents, and pulled the camera out, placing it against the corner, where the bag would shield it.  I got my notebook out, opened it to an empty page, and put it across the corner of the roof, before pulling out the chips and what turned out to be curry in a pita wrap.Curry in a pita was not a mix I’d run into before, but I wasn’t going to complain.  I put the wrap on my notebook, weighing it down, and the chips by my bag, against the ledge of the roof.My backpack shielded most of the camera from view, the notebook’s placement shielded any view of it from above.I had to take it slow.  I sat on the roof, leaning against the ledge, opened the bag, and adjusted the plunger.  I reached into the bag, and discovered they weren’t chips, but a salted pork rind thing.Urg.I ate a few, penned down some general observations of the neighborhood, and then adjusted the plunger slightly downward, as part of the process of reaching down to fish for another mouthful of overly-salted pork things.It took maybe a minute and a half to two minutes, because of the regular pauses here and there.  I heard the ‘boop’ through my phone, took that as my signal, and pulled my phone out to cancel the call, being sure to keep it at an angle where someone watching from above me couldn’t see the phone’s face or display.I was nervous, remaining where I was.  Every moment I was here, I was guarding the camera, the camera was presumably filming, and we were getting information.Every moment I was here, I was being watched.  My forcefield was down, because having it up risked it damaging the roof, building, or the camera.  The locals were getting time to figure out what to do with me.We wanted to stir the hornet’s nest, to keep it stirred to exhaust resources and keep them from being particularly effective villains.  Those same hornets could sting.I ate some of Chris’ curry in a pita, just to look like I was on a typical stakeout or patrol, and I wished I’d brought a drink.  I took notes, with an eye to graffiti and symbols, to names and sayings.  Things I could look up later, to see if I could divine any other names or personalities that had settled in Cedar Point.It was maybe five minutes in total before they decided they were uncomfortable with me being where I was.  Across the street, a big guy in costume emerged.  Blond haired, a metal mask with fur on it, and a combination of metal and what looked like horn or natural armor plates on a brown costume.  His gauntlets looked menacing, with fur, metal, and studs.He looked pretty B-list, all in all.He beckoned for me to come.  I wondered if I should gather my bag.I decided to take a risk, leaving it where it was.  I flew down to the street below.“I’m Moose,” he said.  “You’re unwelcome.”“The last time I came, you guys called Tattletale.  She told me to get lost.”“Yup,” Moose said.“To me, hearing that, I’m inclined to think I should show up more,” I said.“Ahh, nope,” he said.  “No, I think you’ve got the wrong inclination there, Glory Girl.”I shrugged.  “What can you do, Moose?”“What I’m going to do, Glory Girl, is I’m going to tell you how this is going to go down.”“Do tell,” I said.“Two brutes, like you and me, heavy hitters, we’re liable to have a brawl.  I’ll avoid breaking anything breakable because I have an investment in Hollow Point here.  You’ll avoid breaking stuff because you’re one of the good guys.  You don’t want that bad PR.”“Makes sense,” I said.“We’ll have a really polite knock-down brawl, as such things go, and you’ll trounce me.”“I’ll trounce you?”“I said I’d tell you how this was going to go, and I’m pretty sure that’s how it’s going to go.”“Thinker power?” I asked.“Only thinker power I got is decently good common sense,” Moose said.I nodded.“So you’ll trounce me.  Thoroughly.  You’ll embarrass me, even.  Not because you’re a girl and I’m a guy, but because you’re strong and you have more experience, and because fighting someone who flies is a massive bother.”“You could surrender.”“Can’t.  Invested in this place.  But there’s more to it, Glory Girl.”“Not my name anymore, by the way.”“Oh, really?  Sorry about that.”“I don’t have another to give you, not yet, but I thought I’d let you know.”“If you’re going to stay, I gotta fight you and I gotta get trounced.”“That’s a shame,” I said.“But there’s more to it.  I’m pulling from that common sense, now.  You’ll trounce me, I’ll be embarrassed, and in the time it takes for that to happen, others are going to show up.  They won’t interfere, but they’ll stand around and they’ll be ready to fight you if you’re insistent on staying.  You’ll be outnumbered and they won’t be inclined to play fair, except that they’ll let you leave if you’re willing to leave.”“Which I will.”“Good to hear.  Except… can we just skip straight to the part where you leave?  I don’t want to be embarrassed and you don’t want to run scared from a group of menacing looking capes.”“I’m supposed to run scared from you instead, Moose?”“You can knock me around as you make your exit, if you’d like.”“Really?” I asked, a little incredulous.He shrugged.“This isn’t a trap?”“Nope.”I used my flight, and rose up off the ground.  He didn’t react.I flew at him, forcefield up, fist out.He met my fist with his, moving faster than I’d expected.  The shockwave from the impact knocked me back and up into the air.  I righted myself and hovered on the spot, ten or so feet off the ground.The shockwave was weird.  Intense, and focused.  There was more to that Brute power.“I can’t embarrass myself too badly,” he said.  “There’s an audience.”I looked.In the window of the pub, Snag had risen to his feet.  Love Lost was sitting, still, watching through the window.  There were a handful of others.I met Snag’s eyes momentarily, and tried to look a little surprised.Then I flew at Moose again.  I pushed out with my aura.His reaction to the fear and awe was to strike out, a solid punch, not a reckless one like most would throw reactively.  I didn’t follow the awe with an attack, and I was glad I hadn’t, because the chances were good that I would’ve been hit.Instead, I used his momentary bewilderment to fly over his head, because it was easy to do, it required him to turn around.  Better yet, it involved a lot of readjustment of footing and balance, at the same time he was recovering from the emotional hit.Watching, waiting, feeling more like the warrior monk as I used this approach, I tried to identify the time his footing was still off, his awareness of me imperfect, and I dove, striking him with one foot in the collarbone.In the process, the wretch decided to strike out too.  It hit him across the face, knocking the mask off.  I saw blood, and the tracks of fingernails.He fell, and he sat there, his head turned away from me, one gauntlet-covered hand moving to his face.“You okay?” I asked, flying up and looking away.  I didn’t want to be accused of peering beneath the mask.“I’ll mend,” he said.I didn’t wait, and I didn’t look back.  Back to my notebook, to my bag and book and Chris’ meal.  I packed it up, collecting the camera.When I’d crossed the water and reached the edge of the neighborhood where the hideout was, I called the others.“Thanks for that, Victoria,” Sveta said.“How’d we do?”“We didn’t get the very start and we didn’t get what would’ve been the end, but we got some, and I think everyone’s happy with that,” she said.  “You okay?”“I’m alright.”“Come back.  We’ll talk, and you can see what we got.”I flew back.  I didn’t fly in a straight line, being mindful of any possible pursuers, and I flew lower to the ground as I drew closer to the building where the place we were renting was.  I landed at the edge of the lot and walked to the fire escape.Ashley, Sveta, Kenzie and Chris were all present.  They were watching a distorted and monochrome image of the inside of the pub, projected on the wall.I noted the absence of Tristan and Rain.“He ran,” Ashley said, her voice low.“Rain?”“He got spooked,” she said.  “Tristan went after him.”“To reassure,” Sveta said.Chris reached past Kenzie to hit keys on the keyboard.  The image on the projector screen changed.“You suck at that,” Kenzie said, elbowing him.  “Here.”The image was distorted, as if viewing something underwater, with a film of grime on the lens.  The sound, however, was only slightly muted.“You really want this kid to suffer.”“We want him to face a fate worse than death,” Snag said.  “But we can’t have that and have him dead at the same time, and we need him dead.  If he suffers as much as possible along the way to that conclusion, we’ll be satisfied.”“If you’re paying, we can satisf-”The message cut off as Kenzie hit a key.  She looked back at me, shooting me what might’ve been an attempt at a reassuring smile.  Not so reassuring.“We’ll figure something out,” I said, to myself as much as them.                                                                                           Shadow – 5.2                                                                                        “Maybe trouble,” Kenzie said.I was digging through my bag when she said it.  I set some of my things aside and headed to the front of the room.  Erin was standing beside Kenzie, while Kenzie regaled her with stuff.Rain was thirty feet away, sitting in his computer chair in his nook.  Some of the tables we’d arranged were situated so the long side was against the wall, but in the interest of giving Rain some desk space, we’d set up two so the shorter ends of the table were against the wall and the tables jutted out into the room, his whiteboards against the wall between the tables.  He’d unfurled a roll of paper tablecloth, laid out his arms on it, and was using marker to draw on the tablecloth and make references.His bag was open, and I could see the jaws of a bear trap and a bit of chain within.He looked up, met my eyes, then looked at the screen.  He remained where he was.  He, Sveta and I were the ones who hung back a bit.  Him because of his work, and Sveta and I because we were rummaging in our bags.“Continuation of a bit of family drama,” Kenzie said.  She hit a few keys.  The camera’s image on the screen focused in on one section and rotated.Nailbiter and a teenaged girl were standing outside of the nail place where Ashley had been comparing her nails to the outdated example images in the window.  A middle-aged woman with bleached blonde hair was holding the teenager’s wrist.  The angle didn’t allow for a very good view of Nailbiter or her expression.  She didn’t seem to be doing anything to step in.The teenager had a resemblance to her mother, but was slender.  Her hair reminded me of how Byron wore his, it was the same medium-long length, slicked straight back from the face, but the teenager’s was bleached where Byron’s was black.  In facial features and in expression, the teenager was a younger mirror of her mom.  Neither was happy with the other.“What’s this?” I asked.  “What’s the drama?”“The girl is Colt.  She was working for her parents, but business was slow, they weren’t paying her, and now she’s working for Nailbiter.”“Working how?” Tristan asked.“Muscle, I guess?” Kenzie asked.“She can’t weigh more than a hundred and thirty pounds,” Tristan said.“Okay, well, she’s hanging out with Nailbiter and she’s getting paid, I think, because she’s had new clothes lately,” Kenzie said.“You’ve been watching her?” I asked.  “How do you know all of this?”“I’m not watching her watching her.  That makes it sound like I’m being creepy spying on people.  Geez.  It’s because they keep having shouting matches at night, and idle cameras go on alert mode at loud noises, so I end up hearing stuff.”“So you’re being creepy eavesdropping on people,” Chris said.Kenzie glanced around her desk.  “I’d throw something at you if I could find something I’m okay breaking.”“Family issue, okay, but what’s going on now?” Tristan asked.“And do we need to step in?” I asked.“I don’t know,” Kenzie said.  “Colt left the place to go talk to Nailbiter on the street, and they started to leave when Colt’s mom, Tammy, went after her and stopped her.  Her sister, who’s about my age, she went outside with Tammy the mom and ran back inside.”“Audio?” Sveta asked.Kenzie hit a key.Chris asked, “Who names their kid Colt?  Or is that a shitty nickname?”  Chris’s second question had him inadvertently talk over the start of the audio feed.  Kenzie shushed him.“…cking let me go!”“Get inside!  You’re still in trouble for stealing!”“Fuck you!  I deserved something!”“She’s been helping, you haven’t!”“The one time she helps, you decide to pay her, and I get fuck all because it’s the one time I decided to go out instead!?  Fuck that, fuck you!”“Is this how we’re doing this!?” the mom screamed at Nailbiter, ignoring her daughter for the moment. “You want money from us while you’re scaring away the business, and now you’re taking my little girl, too!?”“I’m not fucking little!”“She decides,” Nailbiter’s voice had a slight whistle around the words.  “I’m losing patience, Colt.  If I walk away from here without you, I’m not bringing you along again.”“I decide, not her!” the mother raised her voice.  “I’m the mother!”“Then the two of you need to decide,” Nailbiter said.  “Now.”Colt hauled back, her arm still in the firm grip of her mother’s two hands.I looked at the door.  If I flew over now-A sound of an impact made me look back to the screen.  Colt’s mother had turned away.  Colt had her free hand raised.  She’d slapped her mother.Her mother moved to retaliate, and Colt pulled back out of the way.  There wasn’t much heart behind the swing, either.  Not for the mom.  The teenager tugged to try to free her arm, and when she couldn’t, she swung again.  Not a slap this time, but a punch.Kenzie looked away before the second punch could land.  She didn’t look back for the third or fourth.“Shitty name girl’s got grit,” Chris said.“No,” I said.  “I don’t think that’s grit.”“Colt!” the father hollered the word, on emerging from the nail salon.  Colt backed away, arm free of her mother’s grip, while the father advanced.Nailbiter stepped forward and to the side, to put herself between Colt and her father.  The father stopped in his tracks.  He looked at his wife, then leaned over for a closer look, touching her cheek where it already looked like it was going to be a heck of a bruise.He and his wife stood together as they squared off against Nailbiter.“She’s mine, now,” Nailbiter said.“Are you, Colt?” the father asked.  He got angrier as he talked, “Are you hers?  You’d hit your mother, who sacrificed so much for you?”Colt looked spooked, in that moment.  Kenzie zoomed the camera in further, moving the mouse.It was Erin who said something.  “Say no.”“Fine.  I’m hers,” Colt said.  “Fuck this.  At least she pays me.”“Brave sounding words, while you’re standing behind her.  You’re not going to stand aside, let us handle this as a family?”“No,” Nailbiter said.  “She’s an employee.”“I don’t want trouble,” the father said.  “We can leave it at this.”“If you want,” Nailbiter said.“Good,” Colt said.  “Leave it and fuck off.”“Don’t come home,” the father said, and his voice was hard, now.  “Don’t show your face in front of me, your mother, or Reese again.  Be her errand girl.  I’m done trying with you.”Colt was silent.“Patience lost,” Nailbiter said, the dry whistle catching on the ‘s’ of Lost.  “I’m going.”“Mom?” Colt asked.  I heard her ask that, and I wondered if she wanted her mother to grab her, to drag her away.“What are you asking me for?” Tammy asked, one hand at the side of her face.  “If you’re going to go, then go.”“Yeah?” Colt asked.  She spat the words, “Fuck you.”“I’ll be by next week to collect,” Nailbiter said.  “See you then.”Another whistle on the ‘s’ of ‘see.’  Nailbiter and Colt walked away.  The father hugged his wife.“Is this kidnapping?” Sveta asked.“No,” Tristan said.I shook my head.  “We could call authorities, but I have a hard time believing we’ll be able to get cops out there, and have them take action with a nearly-18 person who doesn’t want to cooperate or go back home.”“Having the police show up to take her away might make her dig her heels in more,” Sveta said.“Stupid,” Erin said.  “So fucking stupid.  Colt and her parents both.”Her eyes were a touch moist as she shook her head, arms crossed, and ducked past Sveta and I.“Too close to home?” Sveta asked.“I can’t talk about home.  Sorry.  Give me a second.”“Okay,” Sveta said.  She met my eyes.I had worries, but they were ones I’d rather not voice aloud.  Nailbiter had a history that had seen her arrested and sentenced harshly, without much delay.  Post-Gold Morning, she’d settled back into her role as a violent cape, serving as what might have been Beast of Burden’s second in command.She was calmer than she’d been reported to be in the one article I’d been able to dig out of my boxes of notes, part of an article from a magazine, listing the Birdcage’s residents at the time.  The last page of the article, annoyingly, hadn’t been preserved.  I’d pulled the page out for whatever article or image was on the other side.Either way, violent, as might have been expected for an ex-con with rusty nails instead of teeth.  Prison and nine years might have changed her a bit from the person described in the article, but I doubted Colt was in good hands.“Okay,” I said.  “We don’t want to ignore this.  I’ll make some calls later.  I’ll see what I can find on Nailbiter.  She was from North Carolina, I think, and some of their capes are still around.  I’d have to track down a veteran.  We’ll see what we’re up against.  If I get a chance, I’ll have a conversation with her.”“And say what?” Chris asked.  “Parents don’t want her, intense nails-for-teeth lady does.”“She didn’t want to go, and I think her parents wanted her to stay,” Tristan said.“‘I never want to see your face again’ sounds like a real term of endearment,” Chris said.“If she’s with Nailbiter,” Tristan said.“I’ll talk with her,” I said.  I looked at Ashley.  “Given the crowd you’re likely to run into while you’re over there, there’s a chance you may see her.”“She hit her mom, several times,” Ashley said.“Yeah,” I said.“Her mom was willing to hit her back.  Colt learned that behavior from someone.”“You’re assuming she picked that up from her parents?  That’s a bit of a leap.  We can’t know for sure,” I said.“We can guess,” Ashley said.“But we can’t know,” I said.  “It’s… far from great, that situation, Colt, her parents.  Maybe think about what you might say or do if you run into her.”Ashley shook her head slightly.“No?”“I was thinking more about Nailbiter,” Ashley said.“Okay, you should already know she’s dangerous,” I said.“I’m more dangerous, I’m not worried.  I want to go.  Sooner than later.”“Do you still want to do the eye thing?” Sveta asked.“If possible.  I’ll take my mask off when I’m with others.”Sveta turned to me.  “Did you find anything usable?”“Mascara.”“I have stuff, plus the white cover-up.  Erin?  Do you have anything?”“I have stuff,” Erin said.  “What are you doing?”It was a series of last-minute tasks, Sveta, Erin and I helping do up Ashley so she could present a good face.  Kenzie was high-energy, switching from watching to fiddling with the yet-to-be inserted eye camera to talking to Chris about what he was doing when he went out.“Any word on Snag’s group?”  Rain asked.  Ashley was in a chair with her back to the table Rain was using for work on his hands.“We’ve seen Snag and Love Lost around,” Kenzie said.  “Love Lost more than Snag.  She was in a bad mood yesterday.  She went away for a while.”“Snag is tinkering, and if Victoria’s description of how he operates was any clue, he can tap into his other powers through his tech,” Rain said.  He slapped something metal down on the table, hard.  “And I’m struggling with something that should be simple.”“I want to talk to you about tinker stuff after,” Kenzie said.“I had some small arms for you to mess with, but they got broken,” Rain said.  “I have the contact pads.”“Awesome,” Kenzie said.  “I think we can figure something out.”Ashley was patient as we applied some white and black eyeliner, then used Sveta’s cover-up to fix the color around the eyes.“I wish I could do this,” Sveta said.  She was handling the holding of the various brushes and objects, so we could hand one to her and take another.  “But my hands can’t hold the brushes and pencils, and I wouldn’t feel safe with my tendrils out so close to Ashley’s face.”“Tendrils,” Erin said.“I don’t know what Rain told you, but I’d probably accidentally rip out Ashley’s eye.”“If they do a bad job, we can wash it off and you can try,” Ashley said.  “If you rip out my eye, then I’ll have the intimidation effect I want.  Of a different sort.”“Of course,” Sveta said, with an unusually sarcastic tone.  “You’re fine with losing an eye, that’s badass.  But you can’t wear a wig, because if it was knocked off, that would be embarrassing.”Ashley sighed.  I nearly stabbed her in the nose with the eyeliner pencil.“Don’t move,” I told her.I finished with the eyeliner, and stepped back to admire the work.  A white line along the lower lid, to make the eyes appear larger, and black mascara, because her eyelashes were apparently white without.  Erin had handled the careful application of fine veins of black eyeliner that fanned out from the eyes in parallel with the eyelashes.  They had been drawn in waves with each wave washed out with pats of the white cover-up, so the lines appeared to fade out and have dimension.  At each corner of each eye, I’d drawn a hooked triangle, with the hook pointing down at the inner corners and up at the outer ones.Erin had a bit of the softer, artistic touch for the lines and fading-out, I had the steadier hand for the line work.The only mirror was a compact mirror, too small to show everything, so I took a picture instead.  I showed Ashley.“Good,” she said.  She smiled.“Stay put,” Kenzie said.  “Eye camera.  Here we go, and I can’t touch your face because  I don’t want to smudge the nice makeup.”“Camera first next time, then,” Ashley said.Erin clearly had the heebie jeebies, as Kenzie held the needle within a few inches of Ashley’s eye, swinging it within half of an inch of the eye as she rotated one part to get it tighter.“Okay,” Kenzie said.  “Here we go.  Same as before, but don’t flinch and keep your eye fixed on one point.  Making contact on three, ready?”“Ready.”“Zero, one, two, thre- wait.”Ashley stayed stock still, waiting.“Haha,” Kenzie said.  “I should turn it on first, or it won’t phase in.  That would’ve been a mess.”“Would’ve ruined my makeup.”“On three, this time.  Zero, one, two, three.  Can you feel it this time?”Erin shook her arms, as if she couldn’t shake off the goosebumps, and walked away, her back to the scene.“I feel like it’s there, but it doesn’t feel five percent there.”“And…” Kenzie held up another, shorter needle.  “For the effect.  On three.  Zero, one, two, three.”Kenzie stepped back.  Ashley’s pupils were gone.“Ta da!”“Projection?”“Super low tech,” Kenzie said.  “I put liquid eraser on the projection caps, which aren’t phased in.  It’s not perfectly matched to the rest of her eyes, but it works if you aren’t looking super close.”I took a photo and showed Ashley.She stood from her seat, and bent over, hand on Kenzie’s shoulder, planting a kiss on the very top of Kenzie’s head.“You like it?”“It’s good.”  Ashley looked at Sveta, Erin, Kenzie and I, and then said, “Thank you.”With that, she put her mask on carefully, eyes still decorated behind the eyeholes, and walked briskly on her way.“I feel pretty good about how we did there,” Erin said.  “Can you send me the picture?”I passed a copy of the picture to her phone.She checked she had it, then smiled.  “Thank you.”“Not a problem.”“It’s nice to have something.  I haven’t had many wins lately.”“Are you doing okay?” I asked.She shook her head.“Anything I can do?” I asked.“This is cool, superheroes, distractions,” she said. “I was super into this cape stuff once.  And this stuff helps Rain, in a roundabout way.  Which might end up helping me.”Rain was at his whiteboard, scribbling furiously in red marker.  He’d written a list of ten items, and he was erasing all but the bottom three, the aggressive side-to-side motion of the eraser making the whiteboard rattle against the wall.“Rain?” I asked.He stopped, still facing his whiteboard.  “I had ten ideas on things I wanted to try.  I did some napkin level tinker-notes and found out tolerances are lower than I thought.  Scratch eight ideas, now I have two, which is probably going to become zero when I do the next set of calculations.”“Being a tinker is hard sometimes,” Kenzie said.“Kenzie,” Rain said.  He brought one hand up to his forehead, back still to the room.  “If I could build one of the things I’ve seen you make, I’d be happy.”“Sorry,” Kenzie said.“I can’t do stuff.  It’s not hard, it’s impossible.”“Go easy, Rain,” Tristan said.“I’m sorry I touched a sore spot,” Kenzie said.Rain shook his head, turning around, hand still at his forehead.  He dropped it, looked at Kenzie, then looked away.  “I do appreciate the thought.  Yes, being a tinker sucks sometimes.”“Maybe you can take a look at my tech later,” Kenzie said.  “You can see if it inspires stuff.  And you can explain the contact pads.  Being a tinker might have its bad points, but we can be two tinkers working together.”“I’d like that,” Rain said, and it sounded a touch forced.  “Yeah.”Kenzie’s smile looked more forced than Rain’s.“Why don’t you take five minutes, step outside for some sun and fresh air?” Tristan asked.Rain looked like he might resist.  He looked at the board.“You’ve said it helps,” Sveta said.  “It’s how you unwind.  Nature and space to think.”“I have,” Rain said.  “Yeah.”“If it’s okay, I’ll have the camera above the door turned on, so we can make sure you won’t get kidnapped,” Kenzie said.  “Or someone could keep you company.”Rain nodded.  “Alone is good.  The camera is fine.”“Got it.”He paused at the door.  “You’re great, Kenz.”“Thank you.”“I’m sorry I’m shitty, that wasn’t about you.  I was ready to snap at anyone, I was so frustrated at this stuff.”“It’s okay.”“Go outside.  Take a bit,” Tristan said.Rain stepped out onto the fire escape.  The door slammed behind him, more because it was a heavy door than because he’d actively slammed it.“He needs help,” Erin said, quiet.“It’s a bad situation,” I said.She nodded.“That wasn’t about you, you know,” I could hear Tristan telling Kenzie.  “He’s stressed.”“I know.  But it isn’t cool.  There’s a big part of me that feels like it is about me.”“It isn’t.  Cool or about you.”I looked around the room.  Chris was at his station at the point in the apartment furthest from the screens that wasn’t inside the bathroom.  He was bent over a video game.The cameras were capturing video from high overhead.  One came down at an angle, and the other was a bird’s eye view, depicting only the tops of heads.  Ashley had yet to arrive.  The cameras tracked automatically, based on the people they recognized and their apparent importance.  One was following Nailbiter and Colt.But there was another measure of tracking: it seemed to judge by number.  The other camera was shifting to look northward.  The labels popped up as people were recognized, so distant they were barely more than stick figures.  The labels congealed together into a single large label above the small crowd.  Twelve unrecognized individuals.“We didn’t have a patrol coming through, did we?” I asked.“Not for an hour,” Tristan said.  He turned to look.  “Oh what?  Fuck me.”Kenzie ran past Erin, Sveta and me to get to her desk, seizing control of the cameras.  She focused in on the crowd.“What’s going on?” Tristan asked.The costumes were distinct enough for me to recognize them before any icon came into view.  Bold contrasts of light and dark, angles, armor panels, and bright colors.  Masks tended to be full-face.  All of it looked like they had one very tired designer working on their costumes.  Cohesion to the max.The camera caught the icon, and it popped up in a window, blur-corrected.  A figure running to the side, drawn out as a collection of triangles and irregular shapes.  Their arm was out and holding an arrow-shaped shield.  Others had slight variants on the same icon, to play into costume textures and other minor details.“Advance Guard,” I said.“We haven’t talked to Advance Guard,” Tristan said.  “We actively avoided bringing Advance Guard into this.”I looked at Erin and touched her shoulder.  “Do you want to go get Rain?”She nodded.A second screen was projected onto the wall to our left.  The camera began gathering blurry portraits together, lining them up in three rows and four columns, each showing one mask.  As the camera got better resolution shots, they were overlaid over other shots of the same person, the images clarifying in stages as each image was uploaded.  Some details remained blurry, while others became bold and precise.Rain entered the room.  He approached the desk with arms folded, looking weary.Everything was still clarifying as Chris exited the washroom and belatedly joined us.Spright was one.  Shortcut another.“They invited themselves?” I asked.“Fuck them if they did,” Tristan said.  “This is our jurisdiction.”“We can worry about that kind of thing later,” Sveta said.  “Do we intervene?”“It could be a trap,” Rain said.“He’s right,” Chris said.  “Prancer’s supposed to try something.”“We’re supposed to think he paid off Advance Guard?” Tristan asked.“He could have,” I said.  “They’re money hungry, with fancy costumes and nice facilities.  I’ve had pretty mixed reactions dealing with them, too.”Tristan frowned.  “Okay.  I’m bothered they’re just marching in here.  Assuming it’s not a trap, what’s even their plan?”“The locals might have called for help,” I said.  “Advance Guard could have been that help.”“It hasn’t been that long,” Sveta said.“Twelve capes.  Many I don’t know or recognize.  I don’t want to rule anything out.”“Makes sense.”“They’re good,” Tristan said.  “And there’s a lot of them.”“But they’re aggressive.  Their usual M.O. is to blitz a target,” I pointed out.“Not out of the question here,” Tristan said.Even though they were walking in as a group.  The place being a peninsula mattered.  It meant there were less routes to get in.  It made it easier to keep watch.  There would be eyes on Advance Guard, clairvoyant or no.“I should go,” Chris said.  “I’ll have my phone.  If we need to do something, I can jump in.”“Be careful,” Tristan said.“I’ll be fine.  I’ll change when I’m close.  Don’t record me, Kenzie.”“Why?”“Because I have to ditch the clothes, or I’ll tear them to shreds.  I’ll be naked.  I want privacy.”“Okay, um, I’m very fond of you, Chris, but despite the fact that everyone seems to think ‘tinker camera’ and immediately think of that, the perverts, that’s not how I operate.  I don’t want to see you naked, so you’re good.”“I’m noting that you haven’t said you won’t record me.”“I won’t record you, Chris!  Relax!  You’d think you already did the anxiety thing.”“I did, yesterday, to get home faster.”“Okay, um- lost my train of thought.”“That’s a good thing,” Tristan said, taking some authority.  “Chris, go.  Kenzie, turn the cameras away.”“I’ll go too,” I said.“No.  Hold back,” Tristan said.“Hold back?”Tristan said, “Ashley’s in there.  We don’t want her arrival to coincide with yours, and you’ve shown up a lot.  We already came pretty close with you and her being within a day of each other.  Her being connected to Chris is less bad, and he won’t even be human.  Let’s keep them from making the complete connection.”I saw his hand move.  Flat, at an angle, as if telling me to stop, but not quite stop.He was trying to communicate something with me?Caution?  Something else?“Okay,” I said.He gave me a little nod, turning back toward the screen.  “We send you in if it gets ugly.”“Let’s hope it doesn’t,” Rain said.“Is Ashley in their clairvoyant’s usual range?” Tristan asked.“Yes,” Kenzie said.  “Should we call her anyway?”“No,” Tristan said.I wanted to ask why he’d signaled me, but I could hardly do that.  I likely wouldn’t get an answer until this was over with.The villains were gathering.  The initial group that appeared was roughly the same size as Advance Guard’s group.I could see Kenzie’s labels with the attached names.  Love Lost was in the crowd of villains.  Snag was absent.Colt was hanging back, not far from Nailbiter.On the wall, the Advance Guard mugshots were filling in.  I looked for the familiar first and found them already named.  Spright, Shortcut.Mayday, Siren, ReSound, Gong… “Mayday,” Kenzie said.  “He was Baltimore.”Signal Fire, Flapper, Prong…“I trained under Signal in San Diego, too,” Kenzie said, adding, “I’d really like to use that training someday soon.”“Someday,” Tristan said.“You dropped the ‘soon’,” Kenzie said.  “We need to talk about that, after.”This was difficult enough without you getting involved, Advance Guard, I mused.“Every time I run into Advance Guard, it’s a headache,” I said.  “I run into the one incorrigible asshole in the group, their timing sucks, their choice of where to show up sucks, or it’s more than one of the above.”“Must be how Prancer feels,” Tristan said.  “Heroes turning up out of nowhere.”The two groups advanced until they were in sight of each other.One of the capes on Advance Guard’s side held up a hand.  She continued approaching until she stood halfway into no-man’s-land between the two factions.Kenzie’s computer blipped as the label connected to the individual at the front.  ReSound was the spokesman, apparently.  Her outfit had a lot of circles reminiscent of records or speakers, with the depthed concentric shapes and circles of color in the center of black circles.  The icon on her chest was made of crescent shapes, not triangles, with the shield being a half-circle.Prancer didn’t step forward to meet her, not immediately.  Instead, he waited for a moment, surrounded by his allies.  Velvet was in the crowd.  Moose was absent.  So were Hookline and Kitchen Sink.  Some stragglers were catching up.Ashley entered the street, and Kenzie’s camera provided the label above her head: ‘Swansong’.“Should be Damsel, until she takes the name officially,” I said.Kenzie typed it out, replacing it.Damsel was situated near the back of Prancer’s group.  Some people reacted, but nobody attacked or lashed out.She didn’t even flinch at the people around her or the unexpected situation.  She walked through the left side of the crowd, until she was near Prancer’s left flank.  She leaned against a wall, arms folded, and stared at him, rather than at Advance Guard.Prancer did note her presence, and looked momentarily annoyed.The annoyance seemed to spur him forward.  He met ReSound at the middle of no man’s land.  The camera zoomed in to focus on them.“This is getting tiresome,” Prancer said.“What ‘this’?” ReSound asked.  I’d expected her voice to sound altered, as many capes with sonic themes did, but she sounded normal.  Confident.“The routine.  You guys show up, you’re interested in the area, but you don’t commit.”“We commit,” ReSound said.“Hm?  I don’t follow.”“We’re committing.  We’re staying for long enough to finish the job.  We’re here to break up the villains in Hollow Point.”“Job.  You were hired?”“We hired ourselves,” ReSound said.  “We break up priority targets, and we got to talking.  You guys seem priority enough.”“Based on what?” Prancer asked.  His composure had cracked, but he didn’t raise his voice so much as he allowed emotion to affect his words.  “We sell grass, we live here.  We don’t shit that much where we eat.”“Who was it?” ReSound asked.  “Kitchen Sink.  Hookline?”“They pointed you our way?”“Someone thought they were funny names, and they were joking about it-”Tristan groaned out loud.“-and they wouldn’t say why they were here in the first place.  They aren’t alone either.  Others have been through.  A lot of people find you very interesting.”“We’re very boring villains, really,” Prancer said.  “Insignificant.”“Houndstooth, no,” Kenzie said.  “Ugghh.  I recommended you.”“It was fucking Foxtrot,” Tristan said.  “Foxtrot is the clown in Houndstooth’s group.”ReSound was taking a moment to consider Prancer’s claim of being boring.“I don’t believe you,” ReSound said.  She offered a half chuckle and said, “It doesn’t matter.  We do this, we get some points with the public, and with the current attitude about capes?  Points matter.”“We outnumber you.”“We train.  I’m sure you went to great efforts to get your people together.  Did you watch us on your cameras, then make sure to bring in a few more, so you could say you outnumbered us?”“Cameras?” Prancer asked.On camera, ReSound pointed skyward, not that far off from pointing directly at the camera we were using to watch the scene.Some heads turned, following the pointing finger.In the headquarters, Kenzie shoved her keyboard out of the way and brought her forehead down to the desk.“Not ours,” Prancer said.“Again, I’m not sure I believe you,” ReSound said.“If you’re going to doubt everything I say, why are we even talking?”“Because we always declare war, Prancer.”“No.  You’re up to something.”“What makes you think that?”“The fact this conversation feels like someone trying to keep me on the line so they can get a wiretap, doling out just enough information to keep me interested.  We’re done,” Prancer said.  “Don’t pick this fight.”Prancer was halfway back to his group when Advance Guard took action.Spright.  He dashed forward.  Enhanced movement, straight for the Hollow Point group.  If he was a speedster, he wasn’t much of one.  Faster than a normal human could manage, but hardly a blur.“Avant!” ReSound called out, and the sound was magnified, loud, echoing far faster than a normal echo could or should.  The camera’s sound died, dissolving into crackles.  Several of the Hollow Point villains covered their ears.Prancer was one of them.  Spright ran past him, and the leader of the Hollow Point group flared.  He became blurry around the edges, with the blur reaching out five feet in every direction.  It subsided, but he retained the effect around his silhouette.  The gold on his costume, from his mask to the deer’s head in profile at his collarbone, with antler over one shoulder, all became larger, more intense, more like glass with amber colored lava within its confines.  The green of his costume became smoky.Breaker form.But as he adopted the form, Spright used his own breaker form.  It wasn’t much different, and Spright managed to keep ahead of Prancer, running toward the thinnest ranks of the stunned villains.  Toward Ashley.She used her power, a blast to drive herself in Spright’s direction, as she aimed to intercept.  She was in the midst of people, which limited her options, so she ran several paces before she was clear to use another blast.Still in breaker form, Spright reached out.  A scintillating cloud of energy exploded from his hand.  He used the recoil to change course.Of course.From there, it was a brawl.  Spright disappeared into enemy ranks with his own powers exploding out around him.  With the use of powers, he ducked and dodged between, went over, and slid under people.  He made it out of the back of the crowd and dashed toward the deeper part of downtown.  Ashley couldn’t keep up, but Prancer could.Love Lost staggered forward as ReSound maintained her sonic assault.  One we couldn’t hear or get a sense of, because the camera audio had died.She ripped off her mask.  Then she screamed back.  Advance Guard was throwing up defenses before it seemed like the scream hit them.I couldn’t hear what it sounded like, but I could see the effect.  The people who weren’t fully protected, ReSound included, were laid low.Had it not been for shimmering forcefield-like barriers and strange crystal growths, she might have been able to hit the entirety of Advance Guard, aside from the absent Spright.  As it was, she got maybe three or four.“The emotion attack,” Rain said.Resound’s body language changed completely.  A moment later, she lunged for Love Lost, swinging punches, grabbing.The black haired woman didn’t let her make contact.  She stepped back out of the way, raked with claws, avoided the grab, clawed again.  With the second slash, blood was spilled.The other affected people in Advance Guard were turning on teammates.  Most shouted, silent with our lack of audio, rather than attack.My first thought was, fuck Advance Guard.My second thought was to register the blood.  Blood.  This is serious now.“I’m going,” I said.“We’re coming,” Tristan said.                                                                                        Shadow – 5.3                                                                                        We hurried to get ourselves put together.  Tristan was often the one to take point on the organization side of things, but for the moment, he was ducking under a table, dragging out a plastic bin with his armor in it.  No breath or focus to spare.“What are we doing?” Sveta asked.“I guess we all go,” I said.  “Control the situation, then help the heroes, in that order?  Tristan?”“Yep,” Tristan said, as he straightened up.  He pulled off the v-neck long sleeved shirt he was wearing, undid the necklace with steel beads and a metal ram’s horn, and dropped them into a corner of the plastic bucket.  He had his non-armor costume on under his clothes, form-fitting and covered in patterns that gave some character to what was visible in the gaps between the individual pieces of armor.“What can I do?” Rain asked.“You come if you’re up for it.  Kenzie too.”“Yes,” Kenzie said, without hesitation.“I want you on the periphery,” Tristan said, stressing the periphery part.  “Kenzie, you’re staying close to me, you’re backup and problem solving, we’ll figure out where to park you and keep you as a reserve.”“You’re bringing me along?” Kenzie asked, wide-eyed.I listened and watched, pulling off my sweater with one hand, the other hand holding my camisole top in place.Tristan answered her, “I promised you I would.  You can keep an eye on things with the cameras?”“I can,” she said, enthused.  “Oh shoot!  I need to get last minute costume stuff done, and I have it loaded with stuff for Chris.”She began rummaging, hurrying to get ready.“You want me along?” Rain asked.“It might be best to have everyone along in some capacity.  You stay far enough back the clairvoyants can’t see you and so you won’t run into Love Lost or the others.”“Okay,” Rain said.“Sveta and Victoria together.  Erin?  Good to have you here, but-”“It would be weird if I stayed while you’re all gone.  I get it,” Erin said.I put on the sweatshirt.  I’d peeled off the previous design, and put on a new one.  It was better than the mess before, a similar aesthetic, with the circle and stylized rays, but the lines curled more, reaching out to the seams of the sweatshirt, where they blended into thin black bars.  The hood was framed with the same design.More of my self-care, to get my outfit somewhat in order.  I’d done a little something to the mask, giving it some black accents, but it was still predominantly white.Not that it mattered much.  I didn’t place a serious priority on my secret identity.  Anyone who could put two and two together would know my face, including the villains in Cedar Point.Sveta applied her mask.  She’d taken one of the temporary masks, but in the time since we’d gone out together, she’d taken some art supplies to it.  The same color scheme that covered her prosthetic exterior, with deep, dark blues and greens, neon oranges and yellows, now covered her mask.“That’s great,” I said, briefly, before applying my own, making sure it was symmetrical.“Thank you.  The color rubs off, so it’s only a temporary thing.”“The masks aren’t meant to be long-term,” I said.  “We’re making do until we’re more settled.”I plucked at my sweatshirt as I said it.“That’s temporary then?”“Yeah,” I said, giving her a hard look.  I glanced back at the screen.  “Going to do something better, but I have to figure some stuff out first.”“Okay, haha, I was worried I’d have to dance around my friend having low standards for her costume,” Sveta said.I snapped my head to look around, and saw Sveta stick her tongue out at me.  I gave her a light push.  “Fuck off, and not the time.”“This is better than what you had before.”Baby steps.  Better costumes as I figured out what I was doing.What was I doing?  I could see the mob on the screen.  I knew from my experience with the broken trigger that mobs were hard to wrangle.  Adding my emotion power to the mix, when Love Lost’s had already taken hold?More than anything, I wanted to think things through.  I wanted to be intelligent in how I went about the cape thing, but there were times that couldn’t happen.  This time, where blood was being shed, was one.If law, right and wrong, and the input of others didn’t serve to clarify matters, then I wanted to do what would weigh on me the least.  I was glad that those least-weighty things were often the lawful and right ones.It was selfish.  If a time came in the future where I was disabled, with nothing to do but sit in a hospital room, thinking about the past and dreading my non-future, I didn’t want my memories to be something I had to endure, or things that soured on reflection.I didn’t miss the fact that as that idea rolled through my head, the ‘if’ of the idea had the faintest catch to it.An idea to hold onto for when I saw my new therapist.  When, not if.“I’ll organize these guys,” Tristan said.  He was strapping on his armor. “I’ll run to catch up.  You two figure out what you’re doing.  Remember Chris and Ashley are out there.”I looked at the screen, looking at the labels of the capes involved in the fight.  Prancer and Spright were maneuvering around each other in the middle of downtown, not far from the pub or Prancer’s headquarters.  Nailbiter had left the larger brawl and were giving chase.Snag’s name had appeared and was in the shifting jumble of labels over heads.“It’s too chaotic,” I said.  “If we throw ourselves into that mess, I’m going to hurt someone, Sveta is, or we’re going to get hurt.”“Go after Prancer and-” Tristan turned his head to check the screen on the side.  “Spright.  Keep an eye out for Love Lost and Nail.  Do what you can.  I’ll signal you once I’m closer.  We’ll deal with the mob when we’ve more of our own people around.  Us stragglers will call Chris and the hero oversight.”“Good,” I said.I didn’t want to waste more time.  I pushed the door open, holding it for Sveta, and then took her hand.I picked her up and flew.  When I was higher than any of the buildings in the area, I paused to turn around in mid-air, looking down at the headquarters.“Something bothering you?” Sveta asked.A lot of things were.I flew toward Cedar Point.  If I waited too long, Prancer and Spright would have moved on from the area we’d seen them.“Tristan.  He’s getting everyone out of there,” I said, while we flew.  I had to raise my voice to ensure I’d be heard.“And?”“And- it’s like that riddle,” I said.  “The wolf, the chicken, the corn, a boat with room for the man and one thing in the boat at a time.  He’s-”My voice dropped away as we drew close enough that I could hear the faint scream and the reverberation.  I partially lost my train of thought.“I’m not following you,” Sveta said.“He’s either pulling something or he’s worried someone else will,” I said.  “He’s taking possibly unnecessary steps.”I felt Sveta’s arm move, where it was wrapped around my back.  Tightening.“I don’t like this,” she said.  I could barely hear her.“Me interpreting things like this?  Tristan?  Rain?  The awful puzzle analogy?”“Any of it,” Sveta said.  Her voice grew louder, so I could hear her properly again.  “I don’t want to make this mistake again.”I wanted to ask, but I heard another scream.  I could see a distortion in the air, as colors pulled away from trees and buildings as if they were watercolor or the color was multiplying, casting the surroundings into shades of red and purple.  The effect was brief, and the distortion faded.  No damage had been done to the surroundings.I could feel the effect of it, even from a distance.  My heart rate picked up, and for a moment my thoughts and feelings spooled out.  There were a hundred things I was holding in my heart and head that had to sit there.  There were worries, irritations, traumas, and causes for outright fucking fury that I couldn’t do a damn thing about.  Just being on the periphery of the effect made them swell up and jostle together.Sveta’s arm tightened around me.  I could hear the thump, thump, thumpthump of her tendrils against the inside of her body.I met her eyes.  I could instantly tell that she’d been affected more than I had.I was resistant to emotion effects, because I generated them.  Snag had hit me hard because he’d hit me where it hurt the most.My rage?  It was there, beneath the surface, but it wasn’t a weak point.  It was a regular point.Changing course, I flew straight for the nearest rooftop.  Sveta let go of me and dropped down the moment we were close enough.  She was unsteady on landing, and after her legs didn’t keep her upright, she landed on her hands and knees on the roof’s surface, which was covered in black shingle-like tiles, four feet across.  Puddles of water settled in the parts that were lower than others, waiting to be evaporated by the sun.I kept my mouth shut as the emotion effect subsided, and walked over to the roof’s edge.Love Lost had joined the chase, running alongside Nailbiter, who had extended her limbs.  They made a racket as they ran.  Love Lost’s claws scraped the road and kicked up sparks, and she was faster than an ordinary person.Nailbiter, though, had extended her limbs, but they got narrower as they grew longer, and had become black and gnarled in the process.  Her jaw hung low, the joints on either side extended, her jawbone  made longer and narrower, and the teeth extended further.She looked like something half-crocodile, half-scarecrow.She had no problem with mobility or strength, apparently, as she took strides that were fifteen feet long.Prancer was only a short distance behind Spright.  Spright ducked in between two parked trucks.  As a maneuver, it put a truck between himself and Prancer, and forced Prancer to anticipate which way he’d go, or if he’d carry on straight and go down the alley.Prancer hopped up onto the vehicle in the same moment that Spright slid under it.  The two seconds it took Prancer to look around and try to find out which way he’d gone were seconds he could run, using enhanced speed.He half-jumped, half-climbed up a building, with Prancer in delayed pursuit.  Setting foot on the edge of the roof, he leaped backward, in a backward bound that saw him arcing over sidewalk, street, sidewalk, and put him on course to make contact with a building’s face.I started forward as Nailbiter reached out.  Her arm extended, long, thin, and rigid, fingers doing the same as they became points so fine and far away I couldn’t even make them out.  Spright kicked out and brought an arm up to deflect the piercing fingers with the armor there.  He landed on the roof, and an intervening building meant I couldn’t see where he went from there.I was flying in that direction when I saw Love Lost reach for her mask.  She pulled it off, and I changed direction, reversing course and throwing myself against the roof I’d just left.The scream pierced through the air, raw and magnified in volume. I could see the distortion flare up around the edge of the roof, where the effect was cut off, but it didn’t extend through the building or the roof.  I didn’t feel the change in heart rate or breathing.The color change and distorted blur in the environment was limited to an area in front of Love Lost’s mouth.  Solid objects blocked it.I chanced a peek.  She was down on the street, running past us, Nailbiter a distance ahead of her.  She didn’t seem to have noticed me, even with her emotion power.Damsel was chasing as well, only as fast as she could run, nothing augmented but the blasts, which she wasn’t using.Sveta, Ashley and I.  I’d come this way because we were the worst people to deal with Love Lost.  I’d been ready to leap to Spright’s defense against Nailbiter if I had to, but Love Lost being here complicated that.At least Spright seemed to be managing, whatever he was doing.“Sveta,” I said.  “Are you okay?”“I’m ok-” she started, and the interrupted ‘okay’ sounded like ‘oak’.  “I’m trying to tell my body not to murder my suit.”“Can I do something?”She shook her head.“Okay.”On the street, Spright had escaped Prancer.  He returned to the main street, saw Nailbiter and Love Lost close by, and broke into a run.  The breaker effect was steadily fading.Prancer’s power, I knew, was a breaker effect, to go by the PRT classifications.  It was the most misunderstood classification in playground arguments and online debates, to the point where every power had probably been called a breaker power by someone.  Where changers were powers that changed one’s form and were physical and mostly bound to the natural world, breaker powers were on-off, tied into enabling powers or powersets, and were ethereal or rule-breaking.Prancer’s ‘on’ switch was a power-derived form that made him fast and nimble.  Running and jumping around made the effect steadily ramp up.  It made him fast and evasive.It was good to think about the mechanical side of powers, to dwell in fact and things that made me think of reading cape magazines in bed and talking to Dean.Sveta’s voice stirred me from my thoughts.  “Positive side is I just found out I’m all instinct when I’m forced into attack mode.  My body isn’t smart enough to figure out how to get out of the suit.”“Good thing,” I said.  I meant it as I said it, saw the fleeting smile on her face, but I was also kind of distracted.“What’s going on over there?  It helps if I focus on external things I can’t accidentally murder.”“Spright’s running, I lost track of him.  I’d go to him and ask what the fuck is going on, but he’s trying to be slippery and he’s good at it.  I’d talk to Prancer, but it’s exactly the same thing.  I don’t want to go after Love Lost and fuck up.  I’m wondering if we should run, go back to the mob.”Sveta nodded.“I hate to leave Spright,” I said.  “He might not know about the violence, or who’s after him, and this is a- in big fights, outright wars, it’s good to identify solutions.  If I can get to Spright, I can stop this.”“Love Lost is the biggest problem?”I nodded.“I think I can get her,” Sveta said.  She shifted position and sat back.  “I don’t want to hurt her, but I think I can get her.”“You sure?”“Reasonably sure.”“Rule of thumb I’ve been thinking about?  Seventy-five percent.  No more than three-quarters of the hurt they’ve done to others.  She made ReSound bleed a lot.  You can make her bleed a little.”Sveta winced.“Or not at all,” I said.  “But remember that she’s willing to hurt Rain.  If she had a twisted ankle or something, it’d make a lot of things easier.”Sveta nodded.“You good?” I asked.“I wanted to do this.  Go get Spright.”The best way to get control over this situation.  Spright had been sent forward as the vanguard of Advance Guard.  Was it to lead others on a wild goose chase, or was he after something?I flew a course that put me directly over the rooftops, so the buildings were between me and the pairing of Nailbiter and Love Lost.  There had been some time since the last scream.  Her mask might have been put back on, which would have meant a delay before she could hit me with something.That delay had been a factor when Sveta and I had both visited Cedar Point together, to deal with Sink and Hookline.  It might be a factor here.Prancer’s power wasn’t a threat, but it was a serious consideration.  It made him fast and hard to track down.  Once upon a time, it had meant he could run drugs and make drop-offs as a petty criminal.The drawback was a concern too.  He was forced out of the breaker state and made mundane if he got hurt.I spotted the colorful set of blurs that was the pair, and changed course to follow.  They were leaping between building faces, positioning feet to avoid putting one through a window, and covering as much ground up and down vertically as they were crossing horizontally.  They were fast enough now that if they had been moving in a straight line, I wouldn’t have been able to keep up.Flying over the rooftops, moving in a straight line to close the distance, I caught a glimpse of Nailbiter climbing up a two-story building with the ease someone else might climb up onto a desk.  She moved like she was on stilts, or like she was all stilts.Pointed ones, as I understood it.Her arm moved, swinging.  I heard the sound of fingers as fine as needles slicing through the air, and put my shield up.I couldn’t even see her fingers, as they crashed into me.  Shield down, I changed course before she could close those fingers around me and set me up for something else.Her mouth yawned open.  My shield wasn’t yet up when her teeth extended, but I was able to get down enough she wouldn’t hit me.  Each tooth pointed in a slightly different direction, and she had a lot of nail-teeth.  I heard the faint whisking sound of the thinner-than-needles teeth hitting things almost purely at random.  Each hit with the force of a knife swung overhead and into a table.There was a pause, and I heard an unearthly screeching sound.The teeth had stopped just short of penetrating windows.  With each small movement on her part, points scraped against glass.I saw something thicker than a tooth withdrawing.  Changing course, I maneuvered between buildings, barely a few feet above the ground, my forcefield up.Several feet in front of me, a vague column that looked like it was more shadow than substance  lunged out into my path.My first thought was that it was one of Sveta’s arms.  It wasn’t.  I tried to fly under it, since I was already so close to the ground, and the individual components fanned out to bar my way.I crashed bodily into them, my shield absorbing the hit, and the impact made them slap against the side of a dumpster in the alleyway.  The thing was crude in a made-just-after-the-world-ended kind of way, four pieces of thick metal, welding, and handles for the dump truck.  The hit made one of the sides buckle, the weld at the side closest to me splitting violently.I turned to look the other way, and saw Love Lost with one clawed hand resting on a crouching Nailbiter’s fingers, guiding them.  Nailbiter had both hands together, fingers pointed at me, and the fingers were extended out.Enhanced strength, and the ability to extend any part of her body, making that part rigid and thinner.She moved her hand, and two fingers pressed me against a wall, needle thin bars against my throat and thighs.I couldn’t trust that my forcefield would come back in time.  My feet were only barely touching the ground, but I could fly.  I flew away from her, sliding between the extended digits and the wall.She increased the pressure, and I had to stop, lest I give myself road rash while scraping against the concrete wall.  Another nail-finger shifted position, slapping me across the cheekbone and ear, and pressed my head back.Her mouth opened.  I didn’t see her do anything, but I threw up my shield all the same, the moment I felt it was ready.  I pushed out, hard, and the wretch did the same, gripping and pushing the finger bars that had trapped me.  A foot from my face, her tongue struck hard against an invisible surface.  It would have gone right through me if it had connected.I moved while I could, between fingers and wall.  I could feel here and there where there was a bulge where there had been a knuckle.  I could only imagine how it worked when it wasn’t extended fingers, but the rusty nail-teeth.  Doing this would have been like running a saw against my throat, face, and thighs.These two were dangerous.  I flew straight up, the moment I was free of the fingers, rounding a corner.Instincts told me to press forward.  I wanted to go after Spright, or remove the threat.I stopped instead.  There was a limit to how fast and how far they could travel.  I had a second.Love Lost could have hit me with a scream while I was pinned.  She hadn’t.  She could have seen Sveta and I with her power earlier.  The second might have been explained by her thinking we were bystanders, but the first?Was it that she would have been hitting Nailbiter’s fingers?  Not a good idea, to provoke an enemy who was standing right next to you, not when that enemy was very good at hurting people.An easy conclusion to jump to, but not the only one.  I’d been thinking about breakers, the on-off.  It wasn’t out of the question that Love Lost could only sense emotion when she wasn’t projecting it.  It could be a thing that alternated, with a period of time where she could see, a period she could project, with the mask serving to restrict it.  It could be that her scream disabled her sight for a time after using it, while the power gobbled up energy for another activation, the sight only available when the power was primed and ready.That attack into the alley had been timed to try and hit me, or at least to anticipate me.  My flight pattern hadn’t been predictable.  I didn’t want to have more nail-fingers in my face the second I was up above the buildings.  I wished I was better able to figure this out.The scream, too.  She made people pissed.  Irrationally, recklessly angry.  When she’d done it to ReSound, she’d been prepared for Resound lashing out.  Maybe she hadn’t done it to me because she couldn’t handle me in a fight?Sometimes the simplest answer was the right one.I could call Kenzie and see if they have anything to report, but that might show our hands.  We were already showing so much.I heard a distant scream, terrified, and it wasn’t Love Lost’s.  At the same moment,  my phone vibrated in my pocket.Pulling it out, I checked the screen.  A text from Kenzie, now listed on my phone as ‘Ls’ for Looksee.Ls:



coast clearishI flew straight up, until I had a view of the situation.  I didn’t have a thinker power, but a view of the battlefield from above counted for something.  If my forcefield broke, I would take evasive action.What I saw had to be Chris.  I was far away, so I couldn’t see him well, but it had to be him.  It was a face, six feet tall, three feet wide, with no cheeks or anything but a spine connecting the top half from the lower half, as if the chin and bottom row of teeth were the ‘head’ of an insect, the rest of the head the thorax.  The setup was surrounded by a ring of spider-like legs in varying shapes and sizes.  They looked like flesh and not chitin, though, muscular meat with a pronounced ‘elbow’, coming to a pointed tip where it touched the ground or face.  He jerked and twitched, large eyes wide, and some of the legs seemed to be more focused on clawing at his own face than on keeping him mobile.  I would have said it was like someone dragging his fingernails across his cheeks, but he didn’t have any cheeks.He screamed at them, and it was the sound of mortal terror.  He’d succeeded in getting Love Lost and Nailbiter’s attention, and now huddled at the foot of a building, pulling against it as if he could pull himself through the seam between sidewalk and store.  They didn’t seem to know what to make of him.  I didn’t blame them.Love Lost touched Nailbiter, and pointed in my direction.Yeah, she could see me.  I braced for evasive action.Anxiety Chris screamed again, louder.  Nailbiter moved a hand, and he darted to one side, taking a wild path that saw him running up the wall and off the side of the building, radically changing direction as he touched ground.He was quick.  I was put in mind of a bug darting to the darkness as the lights came on.They were caught between keeping an eye on me and keeping an eye on Chris.When Love Lost touched her mask, Chris sped another fifteen feet in a heartbeat.She pulled off the mask, and she screamed at him.  I could see the distortion, aimed more at the ground now.  Roughly conical, it covered a lot of area.Chris twitched, jerked, moved this way, then that.  He raised his fleshy spider legs and pointed two tips at them, and Love Lost moved slightly behind Nailbiter, as if she’d find cover behind the exceedingly thin limbs.Chris screamed back, raw and scared.There was a moment’s pause, and she screamed at him again.  Compounding the effect?He screamed at her again, quivering in the wake of it, and crept closer.Nailbiter’s fingers stabbed the ground between herself and him.He screamed, brief, and ran away.  It seemed he couldn’t move in a straight line, or the evasive action was built in, because he traced an ‘s’ shape as he ran.I flew to put buildings between me and her.  Where were Spright and Prancer now?  We’d diverted the dangerous elements, but I wanted to fix things.  I wanted to take concrete, measured steps to make things better, now that Advance Guard had shit the bed as badly as they had.I wanted the world to make sense again.  And Cedar Point didn’t make sense.Two more screams, both in short succession.  Anxiety Chris’ scream.  I turned to look, and I saw the faint shadow of Nailbiter’s nail-fingers stabbing skyward.Love Lost was running up the fingers.  They were thin, but she didn’t seem to be struggling.Her mask was off, and she was looking down.  Looking for me.Scratch my earlier theory about her not wanting to provoke me.I couldn’t get to cover fast enough, so I did the opposite.  I headed straight for her.  If she thought she could deal with me, I wanted to see what she’d do.  I pushed out with my aura for the first time, to make it harder.She would be resistant, like Snag was.  Still, I refused to believe that she could deal with my aura, scream, at me, and take evasive action against my charge while thirty feet above the rooftops.Nailbiter lashed out.  Teeth.  My forcefield took the hit, and I carried forward.  Love Lost lost her footing, teetering, then leaped hard off of the fingers.I flew straight down, to put myself out of Nailbiter’s reach, while Love Lost leaped sideways.She touched the side of Prancer’s headquarters, the claws of her hands and feet finding traction on the surface, and she moved like she was running, claws catching and helping to propel her.There was the wall-running power.  She moved fluidly along a vertical surface, claws helping.  Her hand went to her mask, and a hand reached up from below, grabbing her ankle.Sveta.Love Lost was pulled away from the building.  No longer able to make contact with the surface, she fell at a diagonal, in the direction of the rooftop she’d originally been falling down to.  I could see her reorient herself in the air, twisting to put feet beneath her, but she couldn’t stop falling.Not a terminal fall, most likely, but it’d be a hard one.In the distance, I could hear Chris screaming as he ran.  He covered a lot of ground, apparently, because the scream faded with each passing second.Good job, Sveta, I thought.  Not showing her hand, catching Love Lost by surprise, and staying clear of that scream were perfect.  It had taken her a while, but I didn’t blame her for moving carefully and having trouble finding the right position and moment to act.No, that was exactly what I was wanting to do.  It was energizing, in a way, exciting.  For all my doubts, I liked that at least one person was on my wavelength.Chris had done his thing too.  Not bad, but he’d shown himself to Nailbiter, and it worried me that he could have been stabbed if Nailbiter had been a little more willing to pull the trigger and impale him.I flew in Sveta’s direction, and found her waiting, her back to the wall, phone out.She jumped when I floated over to her.“Good,” I said.  “I’ll tell you how good after.”She smiled.  She showed me the phone.Ls:



prance lost sprite.  sprite on roof to W of u



we here at edge of town.  mob splitting up.  some headed ur wayAs I read the messages, a new alert popped up.Ls:



nail dam cominI grabbed Sveta’s hand, and prepared to fly away when Damsel appeared in the alleyway.  I could have called her Ashley, but she didn’t give me the impression of ‘Ashley’.  Shadows fell across her face, accented by the mask and makeup, her eyes were eerily white, her hair was white, and it made for an attention-grabbing profile.  If I hadn’t known better, I might have been intimidated.Nailbiter appeared, looming over Damsel in a crouch, three times as tall as Damsel was, so thin in places as to be almost invisible.  Her face was still prolonged, jaw hanging, teeth pronounced.Love Lost was in Nailbiter’s cupped hand, crouching, holding one finger for balance.  I couldn’t tell how hurt she was.“I’ll deign to let you two help me against the wannabe Alexandria and the girl with the paint,” Damsel said, dismissive.Nailbiter pulled her face back together, the features drawing shorter.  “You aren’t Cedar Point.”There was a whistling ‘s’ sound on Cedar.“I am now,” Damsel said.  “Mess this bad?  Ripe for takeover.”“We can discuss that,” Nailbiter said.“Interested?” Damsel asked.“You’re being hasty,” Nailbiter said.  “I’d be interested if I wasn’t loyal to Bob.”Love Lost swiped out with a claw, dashing claw-tips against the wall to her left.  It made a sound, and both Damsel and Nailbiter focused their attention on her.She pointed at us.“Yes,” Nailbiter said.She started forward, with sufficient clearance to go over Damsel, and I flew with Sveta’s hand firmly in my grip.  I could hear Damsel used her power in the same instant, lunging forward.It bought us time, that she hurled herself forward while Nailbiter was trying to place an extended limb.Time to get around a corner, to take pre-emptive evasive action.They turned the same corner, and Sveta had turned herself around.  She cast her hand out, and gripped Love Lost at the neck and hair.  Love Lost had her hand at her mask, and stopped, not screaming.“Sorry!” Sveta called out, as she hauled Love Lost free of Nailbiter’s grip, pulling her halfway toward us before letting go.Love Lost was like a cat, apparently, acrobatic enough to keep her claws under her.  Still, she was moving fast, momentum was a thing, and the resulting landing was a bit of a roll and tumble, before she managed to stop herself.Scraped up and glaring, Love Lost watched as I put some vertical distance between us.  Nailbiter slowed to avoid trampling Love Lost, falling behind slightly, and then raised a hand, aiming.Reflexively, I brought up my forcefield and heaved Sveta up, back and away.  Instinct.  I couldn’t have my forcefield up while holding her.I couldn’t even watch to see what Sveta did.  My focus was on Nailbiter.She chose to try to get Sveta while Sveta was in the air.  I saw the mass of teeth extending, spearing out, and they were aimed too low to be aimed at me.I flew down to intercept.  Forcefield up, I grabbed them after they had extended past me, pushing down, redirecting.  The wretch had to have grabbed them too, because she moved like superstrength applied.  All of the teeth were attached to her and when I moved some of them, I moved them all.That done, I looked back for Sveta.  The inverse of Love Lost, to tumble so bonelessly through the air, with no ability to reorient herself.My forcefield scraped against the nails as I flew past them, pushing them more before a last-second course correction to intercept Sveta.  I caught her.“Warn me!”I nodded.  It was very possible I felt more alarmed in the wake of the moment than Sveta did, and she looked really alarmed.I looked back.  Love Lost and Nailbiter were on the ground, and Nailbiter wasn’t pressing the attack.“You going to explain that?” Sveta asked.“I can,” I said.  “Sorry.”“It’s okay, but- what was that analogy?  Wolf, corn, chicken?”“Wolf,” I said.  I had an ugly, heavy feeling that thoroughly crushed the moment of triumph.  I flew down, setting foot on the rooftop.  Each passing second, it bothered me more.  “Wolf.”“I don’t follow.  I didn’t follow the analogy in the first place, but- secrets?  Maneuvers?”“Just… wolf,” I said.  I didn’t want to explain it in detail.  “Control issue.  Similar to yours.”I saw her forehead crease above her mask.“You didn’t have one before.”“No I didn’t,” I said.“Okay,” she said.  “You should have told me.”I tried to formulate a response.  She wouldn’t look directly at me.As I opened my mouth, she looked down at her phone, as if she was looking for an excuse to look away.  The tiny change in her expression gave me pause.“What is it?”“Come, Spright’s moving.”She grabbed my arm, tugging.“You can carry me?” she asked.I nodded, seizing her with a firmer grip than necessary, carrying her off the roof.Spright still had a vestige of Prancer’s power, even though Prancer was nowhere nearby.  I could see him running along a rooftop.  He leaped from the rooftop’s edge, to the building face next door.The building was Prancer’s headquarters.  A stone building with a clocktower on the top.Touching fingertips to toes, as his feet pointed straight forward, Spright passed through an open window and landed at a run.  For Sveta and I, we had to get there first, and then we had to maneuver ourselves through the window.  I supported Sveta so she could climb through and then looked around to make sure we weren’t being observed.Well, if the clairvoyants were awake, and they had to be with the day still young, Chris still screaming in the distant background, and various other noises and chaos, then we were being observed.But I couldn’t see anyone who could follow us into the building.The things inside were… not especially nice, even though attempts had been made.  It made me think more of a parent teacher conference room and my mom’s office when she was really deep in work.  Budget desk, budget chairs, budget stuff in general, with the doors being wood that hadn’t even been polished down that nicely before being painted, and some signs of domesticity, with a jacket on the back of a chair, signs of eating at desks, and personal touches littering the space.Spright was already across the floor.  A binder was open in front of him.“Spright,” I said.“The heroine who was Glory Girl, and a friend,” he said, sounding pleasant, even casual.  He picked up the binder and turned our way.  “I heard you were around.”I stalked toward him, reaching for the top of the chest-plate that served as the closest thing I’d get to a collar.  He scrambled back, staying just out of reach, turning to flight when his feet failed him.  He dropped the binder.Failing to get a grip on him so I could shake sense into the man, I settled for pointing a finger accusatorily at him.I could hear Chris screaming in the background, a distant sound I couldn’t place, that might have been a giant tinker device going off.This entire thing had been about taking a topsy-turvy world and making it topsy-turvy for the bad guys, unseating them and breaking their hold.  It had been about sanity, and they’d pulled the most insane fucking stunt, and they’d upended it.But I couldn’t burn bridges.  They were… how would Ashley have put it?  Blithering idiots?  And I had to get along with them.  Heroes needed to cooperate, the team needed it, and I wanted to be diplomatic.“Fucking why?” I asked.                                                                                        Shadow – 5.4                                                                                        “You’re pissed,” Spright replied.“Why?” I asked, again, stabbing my finger in his direction.  He stepped back out of the way of it.  “What the hell is Advance Guard doing?”“This is how we operate,” Spright said.  He put the binder he was holding down, moving a few things to look at the things on the table.  Having verified something or verified the lack of something, he gave Sveta and I his full attention.  “We identify targets in need and we handle them.  We’re good at it.”“What about jurisdictions?” I asked.Spright paused.  One finger tapped the desk.  “This is Foresight’s.  They got this territory when we held a lottery for the major areas of the city.”“Did you talk to Foresight?” Sveta asked.  Her tone was a marked contrast to mine.  It sounded pitying or pleading.  Spright had already pointed out how I sounded.“You think this is your territory,” Spright voiced his realization aloud.“Did you talk to Foresight?” I repeated Sveta’s question in my own way.“Not me personally,” Spright said.  “Okay.  We need to talk this out, but now isn’t the time.  Let me do my thing, two to five minute investigation, then if you wanted to let me copy some of your powers to make a graceful exit, I’d appreciate it.  Then we have a conversation.”He put one hand on the binder.  I put my hand down on the corner of the binder, and slid it away from him.“ReSound got sliced up,” I said.I could see Spright tense.  “How sliced up?”“Enough that I’m mentioning it,” I said.  “And enough that we need you to go straight back to your team and tell them to leave.  Then we can have a chat.”“Okay,” Spright said.  He walked around the table, putting it between us.  “I hear what you’re saying.”“Time is of the essence here,” I said.  The change in position worried me.  Was he going to bolt?  Or anticipating violence from me?I changed my stance, forcing myself to relax my posture.“This isn’t the first time we’ve raided enemy territory or the first time someone was hurt.  We have a pattern we operate by.  I handle my part and I trust the others to handle theirs.”“And Cedar Point?” I asked.“Will be better off in the long run,” Spright said.“Capes aren’t liked right now,” Sveta said.  “The local villains have been pressuring people here who can’t afford to leave, which makes feelings toward capes even lower.  We were doing something here.  You can’t just…”The pity or pleading in her voice gave way to frustration at that last part, to the point she couldn’t finish her own sentence.“…Create a mess and trust they’ll be better off,” I said.“Yes.  Exactly, thank you,” Sveta said.“Others have been coming-”“Were invited to come,” I said.  “Screened, to avoid a screwy situation.”“We were invited too!” Spright said.There.  Now the situation made some sense.  Advance Guard had been invited.  It wasn’t by us.  Someone looking to screw us up or throw a wrench into the works.Sveta and I exchanged glances.“What?” Spright asked.“You may have been played,” I said.  I had to keep in mind that the clairvoyants could be watching.  “Maybe you should walk us through your side of the story.”“Any minute now, people could come after me.  They’ll figure out we’re in here,” Spright said.“Fast version,” I said.He moved, taking two quick steps to one side, before slapping his hand down on the table.  “It wouldn’t be out of the question for you to be working with the bad guys.  Stalling me, throwing a wrench into our plan.  It’d even be a good cover, for a team like Prancer’s B-listers to try to corner or confuse the hero jurisdiction too.”“Completely out of the question,” I said.“Not a moment’s hesitation?” he asked.  “No outrage or indignation?”“It makes sense for you to say it.  But not if you do any digging.  I’m a cape from a cape family.  Every surviving relative I have is a hero or ex-hero.  If I pulled something like that, I’d get caught and I’d lose my entire family and their respect.”“I’m dating and living with Weld from the Wardens,” Sveta said.  “He’d lose everything, and I wouldn’t do that to him.”Spright’s head turned.  He analyzed Sveta, then me, peering through the lens of his future-elfin mask.  “Straight to talking about your relationship to other people.  Nothing about yourselves.  Good cops have crooked cop kids and girlfriends.”“References and connections matter,” I said.  “I could say any number of things about myself, but that’s my words out of my mouth.  Talk to my dad?  My cousin?  They’ll give you a clearer picture of who I am.”“I remember her.  I’ve talked to Weld,” Spright said.“And?”“Fuck,” Spright said.  “Alright.  Fast version?  We caught wind of what was going on here when someone was commenting on the stupid cape names here.  We asked around.  Teams building bonds, taking turns to help out in a place that needed help.”“People talked about stuff that they needed to keep their mouths shut about,” I said.“They didn’t talk,” Spright said.  “Not as far as I know.  But secrets are hard to keep when powers are in play.  They didn’t talk Cedar Point, but they were psyched about working together on a level outside of what the Wardens are negotiating.  On a lower level, I mean.  We have the meetings at the Wardens headquarters, and people were stopping in at the same place.”“And you asked Foresight?”“Not me.  Mayday.  He said we were clear to go.”Who the hell had Kenzie’s old boss talked to, that we weren’t roped in?“Foresight is tied up with war stuff right now,” Sveta said.“They are,” he said.“Is it possible the key people were tied up, and Mayday talked to lower-level members of Foresight?” Sveta asked.“I don’t know,” he replied.“Hold the questions along those lines,” I said.  “Good theory, Sveta, but we should get the particulars later.  Time’s short.”“Okay.  I’ll check the window,” Sveta said.Time was short, and the clairvoyants were possibly listening in.  There was a degree to which I didn’t want to reveal too much to them, at the same time I wanted to get the situation straight.Was it a play, then?  Or was it bad circumstance?Hard to know without talking to Mayday.“Our version?” I asked.  “We’ve been juggling multiple teams, trying to keep on the down low, and we’re holding the fort until a team decides to settle in permanently.”“You, specifically,” he said.“Us, as a group.  We’re setting up as a team,” I said.  I thought of the clairvoyants.  “We’re getting ourselves set up, we’re still getting costumes and names, headquarters, and a long-term plan.  This is an interim job, and it gets us some money, connections, and favor.”“And you think we bypassed that?”“You bypassed it.  The team is getting paid by people who want a chance to get some practice in and mess with the Cedar Point guys while they’re bewildered.  We’re getting resources.  We’re draining their resources.  They’re spending money to hire help, they’re losing people.  They pull favors from major players, get answers or other stuff.  What I arranged, my part in this, is that one of those players gives us a cut each time we provoke these guys to call.  It drains the bad guys and I can give these guys their startup cash.”Sveta was walking around the perimeter of the office.  She stopped and looked my way.  “You’re telling him?”I’m telling Cedar Point.  They want answers, and I’m going to give them Tattletale.I hadn’t wanted to do it so soon, but it was something in keeping with my warrior monk philosophy.  My goal here was stability.  To minimize the ripple effects and keep things from pinging off of one another to cause a greater disaster.  I wanted things to stop.“Yeah, I’m telling him,” I said.I could see Spright consider it.If this madness continued without a scapegoat or a target, then it would only continue unabated, with endless escalation.  So long as Cedar Point thought they knew what was going on, they would move predictably, rather than windmilling their arms around and stirring up chaos.“You were just talking to me about how the company we keep and our references matter.  You’re working with the villains?”“Working with heroes.  Accepting the big picture villains are a part of the picture we’re not going to be able to shake, and adapting to that.  Trust me when I say I do not have any fond feelings for who I’m talking to.  If you knew the name and did some digging into my background, you’d know that.”He reached down to the table and fidgeted with a carving, the shape only partially blocked out.  Wood shavings surrounded it.He didn’t give a response, seemingly considering.“Spright,” I said, dead serious.“I don’t like the way you’re doing this,” he said.“I like you, Spright.  I liked our talk before everything went to shit, when we first met.  But the feeling is mutual.  I don’t like how you guys are doing this either.”I watched as he nodded slowly.“We were here first,” I said.  “I’d really like to cooperate with you guys like we’re cooperating with other heroes.  But either someone’s messing with us by giving you a false go-ahead, or you guys fucked up somewhere.  Whichever it is, you can’t be here.”“Or Foresight fucked up,” he said.“Or that,” I said.  I didn’t believe it.  I repeated myself with more emphasis, “Whichever it is, you can’t be here.  If you were supposed to be here, it wouldn’t be a surprise to us.”He flicked the wooden figurine across the table.  “Damn it.”“Go talk to your people, convince them to quit this,” I said.“I will,” he said.  “Can I use your powers?”“You don’t want to use mine,” Sveta said.  “If you even can.”“You sure?” he asked.  “I get an intuitive sense of movement-related powers.  Yours seems okay.  Coded weird, but I can push past that.”“Mine’s dangerous,” she said.“Yeah,” I said, “Be careful.”“I’m terrible at careful,” he said.  He turned to me.  “Flight.  And… shadows of feet and fingers groping for handholds?  I don’t think that one would move me very far.  Only by inches.”It was the most direct reference to the Wretch I’d heard someone make.  I wanted to reply, to look normal, and I couldn’t.My heart pounded more with the one question and two follow-up sentences than it had with all of my irritation and anger at Advance Guard.“Can you use only the flight?” I managed.“Yes.  Absolutely,” he said.  His feet left the ground.  “Cover me?  We’ll take the direct route.”I followed, meeting Sveta before we reached the window.  As Spright passed through the open window, I saw the look my friend gave me.  I saw it again as I passed through the window, turned around, and put my arm around her waist as she made it through the window in a more than slightly awkward way, prosthetic body not cooperating fully.My arm around her waist, her arm around my shoulder, we flew after Spright.Airborne, a ways ahead of us, Spright put his arms out to his sides.  Ribbons extended out from his wrists, loose in the air, one from each wrist.I gave him a wide berth as I realized what they were supposed to be.He gave us a sly look over one shoulder, then reached out.  The ribbon moved faster than the eye could follow, reaching for a ventilation duct on a roof.  He pulled himself to it, in a very familiar way, reached out with the other, and through a combination of flight and use of the two ribbons, sped well ahead of us.I realized what it was I was seeing.“I’m kind of not a fan of these guys,” I said.“I kind of get what you mean,” she said.  With the wind in my ears, I looked at her to track what she was saying better.  The look on her face broke my heart a little.  It was a longing look, where she didn’t take her eyes off of Spright and his casual use of her power until he was out of sight.A trash can was knocked down here, the contents blown around by wind.  A section of roads had cracks in it that I was pretty sure weren’t from the road settling.In the distance, I heard Love Lost’s scream.  The mob.  She and Nailbiter had returned to the scene, it seemed.I reached for my phone, and I hit the button.“It’s me.  Update?”“I can talk?  Are you there?  Did you leave?”  Kenzie.  Looksee.“I don’t think they’re listening in on phones, no,” I said.  “Codenames only, to be safe.”“Codenames.  It’s Looksee here with Capricorn.  He’s on the phone.  I lost track of who with.  I’m at the perimeter.  Are we good to go?”“Not yet,” I said.  “Hand me over to Capricorn as soon as he’s free?”“Can do.”Closer to the scene where the fighting had initially broken out, things were more chaotic.  I stopped at a rooftop to try to get a sense of it all.Eight members of the twelve initial Advance Guard capes were present.  Spright was near someone I presumed was Mayday, a guy who wore a costume with red and black armor panels and a cape that covered one shoulder.“Handholds and footholds?” Sveta asked, quiet.I pressed the phone against my chest, to muffle it.  “Yeah.  I guess.”“That’s the wolf?  I saw the expression on your face.”In the midst of the fight, Advance Guard was actually faring well enough, even though I couldn’t tell where four of their members were.  Spright was having a conversation with Mayday, as villains approached them, crowding in.  Mayday raised a hand, palm flat, then brought it down, so it pointed forward.  Villains started scrambling out of the way.From the distance, a flare of red light rose against the blue sky at the horizon, framed with something shadowy and dark that made it stand out clearly.It was deceptive, in its general oblong shape, which became a circle and became oblong again, and its apparent lack of depth.I realized what it was and put my hand at Sveta’s arm, in case I needed to pull her away.  A projectile of some sort.  It soared toward us, and touched down in the middle of the battlefield, with Mayday running to intercept it, getting clipped by one of Nailbiter’s claws on the way.It hit him, almost dead on, and smashed into the road like water might, a mess of red strands that glowed to the point they were almost neon, in a sea of darker and darker strands.  The webbed ball dissipated, broke up, the lines spreading out to run through, around, over and under almost everything on the ground.  The larger portion of the mass skidded nearly a hundred feet before breaking up.  Mayday’s team had been carried along with the skid, and as the strands dissipated, they were on their feet, standing in formation.  The villains who hadn’t scrambled out of the way were at the edges, lying down, or pushed between parked cars.  No property damage had been done.They were outnumbered two to one, but Advance Guard wasn’t losing.  They looked battered.  Two of them were being locked down by one of their fellow teammates.  Affected by Love Lost’s scream, it seemed.The phone’s speaker buzzed against my chest.  I picked it up.“The bad guys have reinforcements coming,” Looksee reported.  “From your five.  I think that’s how it works, right?  Five is behind and to your right?  Or is twelve o’clock directly behind?”“That’s how it works, Looksee,” I said.  “Five is right.  We’ll keep an eye out.”I looked back over my shoulder.  Did I want to get involved in the brawl like this?“Victoria?” Sveta asked.Down on the road, Advance Guard were using an area that had become a bit of a bottleneck, with one section of sidewalk fenced off with railings that had been bolted down, so there could be a patio outside one restaurant, and several cars were parked beyond that fence and on the opposite side of the street.  Mayday retreated through the bottleneck with a flying ally shielding him by catching some flung balls of flame in what looked like a web of glowing lines in geometric shapes.  Mayday raised both hands, palms flat, forming a ‘y’, and then brought them down.In the distance well behind him, twin flares of red energy appeared at the horizon.  One of them might have been headed straight for me.I fixed my grip on Sveta’s arm, then carried her skyward.Up, away, clear of the immediate fight, until the figures on the battlefield were specks.  I stopped there, at a height I was pretty sure the clairvoyants couldn’t track me, where the phone I held still had two bars of signal.Comfortably away, secure, and private.  Close enough to see if the reinforcements appeared.“Scary, being up this high,” Sveta said.  “Scarier that you aren’t answering my question.”“Sorry,” I said.“Don’t be sorry.  Answer me.”I nodded.  The sick feeling that had hit me when Spright had commented on the wretch’s existence hadn’t gone away.  It was worse, if anything.Mayday’s power hit.  Two shots, barreling in from the horizon in a matter of seconds, each half the size of a house.  The red balls were more oblong than before, where the last one had only appeared that way because of its arc.  The shape might have been why they traveled further as they hit, carrying people away.  While villains scrambled to get to their feet.  Lines spread out, forming overlapping triangles, circles, squares, and stars, extending in a pattern around the woman who had been shielding Mayday.I pressed the phone down against my chest.“You’re being weird,” Sveta said.  “And weird can be allowed, believe me-”She let out a small, hollow laugh.“-But bad weird isn’t.  You’re not just pulling away.  You’re pushing away.  Throwing me away, literally.”“That’s not-”“You threw me aside, Victoria.  Literally.  You didn’t warn me.”“I wouldn’t throw you if I couldn’t catch you, okay?” I asked.  I wanted to put my thoughts into words without blurting them out, but I couldn’t do that while defending myself and simultaneously making sure I didn’t leave the heroes down below undefended.“It’s not okay,” Sveta said.  “I feel shitty for bringing this up now, but it’s really not okay that I barely recognize you sometimes, and it just got shoved in my face twice.”“I don’t want you to recognize me.”“Not that.  Not- mostly not that.  Not- I’m glad you’re you again.  I’m glad I can communicate with you without you bringing every conversation back to the topic of your sister.”I flinched.  I didn’t blurt, but I did voice something safe and reliable, something I’d already said, because it was safer than that. “It’s the wolf.”“That doesn’t tell me anything.  Spright told me more than that.  I really, really don’t want to find out stuff from other people instead of you, Victoria.”“It’s- My forcefield moves with a mind of its own,” I said.She didn’t retort, and it was my instinct that I’d hear her retort.  That wasn’t based on her, not on the time we’d spent together at the hospital, where we’d kept each other company, communicated, shared a computer and tried to keep each other sane.  It was based on what I’d want to do.  She’d been pressing me, attacking, aggressive.  Were it my old self, without the two-year long reality check, I wouldn’t have been able to just stop after being on that verbal offensive.  I would have pressed.She didn’t.“Since the hospital,” I said, for elaboration.“Moves on its own?  Does it make you move?” she asked.I shook my head.“But it fits your body.”“Not anymore,” I said.  “Not this body.”I didn’t elaborate, because I didn’t have it in me.  I waited, let her put it together.  I saw her expression change, and I focused instead on Advance Guard against Hollow Point down below.We were higher up than a ten story building would be.“Sorry,” I said.  “Having this conversation with you when you can’t storm off or walk away.”“Don’t drop me,” she said.I nodded, stiff.She shifted her grip, extending an arm to reach for my shoulder.  Her prosthetic foot tapped against mine, then her toe settled on top of it.  I held my foot rigid while she pushed herself up a bit, pulling on my shoulders until she’d raised up.It took some doing, and it took me realizing and helping her a bit, but she found a position where she could wrap her arms around me in a hug.My eyes remained on the scene below as I hugged her back with one hand.  My other hand still held the phone against my chest, and Sveta’s hard chest pressed hard against the back of my hand.  It hurt and I didn’t make her stop.I wanted to hug tight, but the pain reminded me it didn’t matter, because it was only her shell.“Thank you,” I said, instead.  “Thank you, thank you.”“Idiot, moron.  Tell me.”“I haven’t even told Mrs. Yamada.”“Lamebrain.  You don’t think I one hundred percent get it?  You don’t think this stuff makes sense to me?  More than anything or everything else?”“Maybe I didn’t want it to be got,” I said.She moved her head, knocking it against mine.  She did it again.It made me think of the hospital.  Of a time shortly before she’d left with Weld.  A couple of weeks before, maybe.  Physiotherapy, working on my manual dexterity, they’d given us video games and controls we could use.  Sveta had done a lot of it, and picked up more of it for the social aspect, so she’d joined me to egg me on.She’d done the head-knock out of frustration then too.  I’d been so focused on trying to get movement out of my hands and translate that to the controls that I hadn’t been paying much attention to the game.It was a bittersweet memory, which was about as good as things had gotten, then.  Two or so weeks later, Weld had gone to see her.  I could remember her anticipation leading up to the meeting.  She’d been so upset over the Case fifty-threes defecting en-masse from the Protectorate and Wards, and Weld’s visit had turned that around.It hadn’t gone well.  I wasn’t sure exactly what had happened.  Then Weld had come to see me.  He’d treated me with more human decency than I’d had out of anyone but my therapists, patient advocate, or the other patients for months.  He’d been patient, ignored my ramblings, he’d been gentle, asked what he could do for me.  It couldn’t have been easy.  I’d been a mess.I’d convinced him to go back to her, with a renewed perspective.  Later on, I’d given them my blessings.  She’d walked away from the hospital with her hero and freedom.  Weld had gotten my only real friend and one of my only unabashed, unpaid-for allies.I drew in a deep breath and sighed.Sveta spoke first.  “There was a time I was with a team.  Things came to a head, a climax.  It turned out half of the team had one idea of what we wanted, and the other half had another.  Blood was shed.  People died.  Really- really cool people.  The deaths weren’t as bad as the betrayals.  I don’t want this to be a repeat of that.”“Neither do I.”“So I want to ask, because I didn’t ask then.  What the hell are we doing?” Sveta asked.“Hugging.  Trying to keep this situation from getting too out of control.”Whatever reinforcements Kenzie had mentioned hadn’t caught up with us yet.  The battle lines were separating, now.  Advance Guard was now a group of seven people.  I wasn’t sure where the eighth had gone.  Spright was at Mayday’s side, talking in short sentences.  Here and there, enemies lashed out.“Those things are now,” Sveta said.“I think… we know what it is to be powerless, and to be stuck like that, and not always having people able or willing to help.  Just about every member of the team does.”“Yeah.”“We’ll help those people.  Cedar Point is a group of those people.”“Colt.”“Colt included,” I said.“Can we get in there?”  Sveta asked.I hesitated.“This is our jurisdiction.”I put the phone to my ear.  “Looksee?”“Heyo.”“Where are those reinforcements?”“Fighting in the ranks.  They’re gathering themselves together.  Eight more.”“Okay.  Is Capricorn there?”“He’s on the phone.  Talking to Foresight now.”“I want to move now.  Before this ends one way or the other.  Have him hang up and give him the phone.  We make an appearance.”I pulled the phone away from my ear at the enthusiastic noise she made.“I’m here,” Capricorn said, on the other line.  “I spent five minutes on the phone with Natalie before giving up.”Giving up?  I remembered trying to convey the situation with Hookline and Kitchen Sink, before having to resort to video evidence.  Maybe we’d need to get her access to Kenzie’s feed.“I was talking to Foresight, they don’t know what’s going on with Advance Guard,” he added.“Neither does Advance Guard, apparently.  It’s time.  We should act before things get worse.”“Ok.  On our way.  E.T.A. five minutes.”Sveta shifted her grip on me at the same moment I flew straight toward the ground.  Her hand slipped from my shoulder, and I caught her.Fucking Advance Guard, fucking Prancer’s people, fucking wretch, hospital, mom, Amy.It couldn’t be easy.The thoughts flew through my mind and I left them behind as I plunged.  I slowed and stopped as we reached the ground, still landing hard enough my legs bent, and I nearly dropped to one knee.I’d put us right in the middle of Advance Guard’s group.“They’re friendly!” Spright called out.“You sure about that?” Shortcut asked.  He was on the periphery, holding his polearm.“Pretty sure,” Spright said.On the other side of the bottleneck were sixteen villains with a scattered few mooks.  Mooks augmented with Bitter Pill’s tinker stuff, it looked like.  Foaming at the mouths, in a way.Snag was there, in the back.  Love Lost had retreated as well.No, there was more to it.  There was a division in the enemy ranks.  Prancer, Moose, Velvet, Etna, and someone who might have been a thinker, in one group.  They moved and talked to one another like they were cooperating.  There was a faint red fog around them, heavier at the ground, at ankle height.Bitter Pill’s group had Bluestocking, the six mooks, Crested, Birdbrain, and Foggy Idea.  That group was more visually distinct, all but the mooks being tidier, and they hung back.  The mark between them and Prancer’s group was subtle.  They were at the edge of the fog, and they held themselves differently.  Crested with his fan and Birdbrain with a bullwhip were the only ones with weapons.Compared to that subtle distinction between Pill’s group and Prancer’s, the Nailbiter, Love Lost, Snag, Damsel, and a couple of the more violent and dangerous looking ones, like Sidepiece and Disjoint, were standing such that there was a fifteen foot gap between them and the others.Anxiety Chris was in the distant background, perhaps a block away, screaming.  His change would be fading soon, I imagined.Eighteen of them.Seven Advance Guard, Sveta and I, with Capricorn and Looksee on the way.Love Lost screamed, and the diagram-drawer blocked it.  Nobody caught at the edges.  I imagined it helped the group had shrunk to seven.“I can’t convince you guys to up and leave?” I asked.“Our teleporter is pulling one at a time,” Mayday said.  “She’d pull us all at once, but the impression got scrambled when the scream hit our thinker.”Sidepiece and Disjoint were moving to flank the group, sneaking around a parked vehicle.  A diagram-wall appeared to block them off.  Disjoint hopped up onto the vehicle and was knocked off as Mayday swung a hand in his direction, casting out a tiny version of the red projectile he’d been bringing in from the horizon.  As Disjoint landed at her feet, Damsel started cussing him out for getting in her way.“It’s going to take a bit,” Mayday said.  “Gets harder as our group shrinks.  Injured go out first, then the less mobile.”“They have reinforcements incoming,” I said.  “Infighting is slowing them down, but the enemy group is going to get larger while yours gets smaller.”“We know this,” Mayday said.  He had a deep, rich voice, which was muffled slightly by his mask.  “The thinker I mentioned, Mapwright, showed us before evacuating out.”“They have more strong capes than we were led to believe,” the diagram-woman said.“We need to talk about who you talked to,” I replied, under my breath.The good guys were stuck, in a way.  Powers aside, the vehicles and nearby railing were the only things that kept the Hollow Point villains from charging in all at once.  It wasn’t that they were that great an obstruction to a group of people like Nailbiter, Moose, or Prancer.  It was that they made it so that for people to pass that point, they needed to approach in ones and twos.“We need to talk, Prancer!” I called out.He didn’t answer, verbally or otherwise.  There was a dark look on his face, and it was the violent clique that grew louder.  Not Snag, not Love Lost, but Nailbiter and her fellows.  Damsel didn’t jeer, but she said something, and one of the villains smirked.“Let’s call a ceasefire!” I raised my voice again.At the front lines, Velvet flung a rusty newspaper box with telekinesis, more to take away something that contributed to the bottleneck than to outright attack.  It crashed hard, squealing as the metal side slid against the rough textured road.That would be their answer, then?Fuck them.Moose stepped forward, and Shortcut took a step to meet him.  The road distorted, space rippling and appearing like water, spray and all, and he leaped forth at Moose’s side.  Shortcut was there, pole in motion, the blade at the end making the end heavy even as he used the dull side to connect with the back of Moose’s leg.Moose didn’t go down, and swatted in Shortcut’s direction.  Shortcut disappeared, appeared again, swinging.  This time the blade was more apparent.  Moose was forced to take a step back.Bitter Pill had a group of six men and women around her, toward the back.  They looked like zombies.  Each had their heads lolling back, and black fluid flowed from their mouths like water from the edge of an overflowing sink.  She was giving them orders, her voice lost in the other noises.Mayday raised his hand, then brought it forward.  The entire assembly of villains reacted.  Etna, who wore a revealing robe in glossy silk, and a black mask with six horns, threw globs of superheated glass.  The robed woman who drew the magic-circle diagrams raised her defenses, only to be caught off guard when Moose, feinting to throw Shortcut off, charged her.Moose’s charge meant much of Advance Guard leapt to the fray, Spright included, and Bitter Pill gave the order for her zombies to attack.  They charged, spilling black fluid from their mouths in the same way someone with a very full jug of water might have water sloshing out.That was Sveta and my cue to get involved.  I flew forward.  Sveta snatched out with a hand to pull one’s ankle out from under it, dragging it into the middle of Advance Guard’s ranks.“Don’t hurt them!  They’re people!” someone called out behind us.I changed direction, as I saw Love Lost get a boost from Snag, which segued into her running up the side of the building.  Two long, lunging steps, with metal glittering around her one leg, dangling like extensive jewelry, damaged in an earlier fall or at some point in this altercation.Still, she grabbed onto a windowsill, twisting around to reach up with her mask.Sveta’s hand went up.  Love Lost shifted her grip, her back to the wall, arms out to either side to grip different windowsills with her claws.  She refused to go down.It did mean she couldn’t remove her mask and scream.  I flew skyward, out of the group assembled behind the bottleneck, toward the building’s edge.Nailbiter was keeping her eye out for me.  In the midst of this kind of chaos, with this many witnesses, she couldn’t go for the lethal strike, but she could interfere.Brutes had a way of gravitating toward Brutes in a fight.  It was a kind of weird rock-paper-scissors thing, where rock tended to favor smashing rock.I used my forcefield to swat aside Nailbiter’s claws.  So soon after the conversation with Sveta, to bring it out and be acutely aware of it, to think briefly of the hospital, it was disorienting.  It made the moment dark.More of Nailbiter’s claws shielded Love Lost, keeping me from getting to her and pulling her free.  Not directly.  I saw Love Lost lower her head and raise her more intact clawed foot.  She was using it as another hand.Flying higher, I looked to Sveta.  I reached out my hand, and she sent hers to me.She pulled herself to me, then reached down, grabbing Love Lost from above.To hold the windowsill and avoid being pulled down was one thing, but being pulled up was another.Love Lost slashed, raking at Sveta’s arm and tendrils.  Sveta let go, and let Love Lost drop.It was Snag who leaped out, flying in a straight line to catch the woman in one mechanical arm, before she could crash into the midst of the crowd of villains.Sveta pulled herself back down to ground level.  Meanwhile, I flew over the enemy group, putting myself behind the herd of enemies, while they scrambled to do something or get clear of the incoming Mayday projectile.It was intimidating, being on the ground, while a ball of abstract energy the size of a one-car garage hurtled toward us.  I was pretty sure it was very selective about who it affected, catching people up and depositing them in a way Mayday thought appropriate, but even with that, I found it distracting.I’d put myself close to Bitter Pill and her group.  The thinkers, the clever ones.  I used my aura, to pressure them, to catch their focus while the projectile sailed toward us.It was Crested, folding fan in hand, who turned my way as I walked in their direction.  All of the darkness of the hospital was in my eyes.  My anger at everyone I couldn’t change or fix was in my body language.  The aura was one thing, but I could be the focus of those feelings of fear and awe that my power stirred in them.Crested swung the fan.  I knew what to expect, and I wasn’t surprised when the fan spun, the folded metal slats multiplying, as the fan became a circle that became a spiral, each multiplied slat larger than the last.  The effect was reminiscent of an ammonite fossil.  A shield of interconnected metal slats that bit into the road and formed a wall between me and them.“Crested!” Bluestocking called out.  “We need a barrier against-”Crested started to fold it up, but it was too slow.  I flew forward, forcefield up, and hit the barrier, just to add to the intimidation and shake the other guys.I hit the barrier again.It kept them from erecting a defense.  Prancer grabbed Velvet and leaped up to higher ground.  Others ran for cover in the last seconds.  Some tried to approach me, to use the other side of Crest’s barrier to defend themselves.  I pushed out with my aura to discourage them in the last moment.I was barely touched, as it washed over me like hot air from a hair dryer.  Others were dragged a hundred feet down the road, pushed back and away from the bottleneck.  Bluestocking’s blue stocking was shredded by the contact with the road, stained red.They were a jumbled heap.  They hadn’t pushed past the bottleneck or delivered a serious blow to Advance Guard before the bizarre siege weapon hit.I flew back to our side.“Let’s end this!” Mayday called out.“Are you surrendering?  Six of you and your two helpers,” Prancer said.  “And-”Behind him, Beast of Burden was arriving with reinforcements.  The leader of the violent clique.  No blood, no barbs or spikes, but the armor he wore was steel, and it looked like slabs had been cut off of tank armor.  Helmet blended into body armor, so broad and heavy it didn’t leave a hint of a neck.  The helmet had bull’s horns longer and thicker around than my leg and only slits for eyeholes.  The chest armor was a slab shaped roughly like chest armor, and similar measures had been taken for the metal segments that encircled parts of his arms and legs.  Cleat was with him, and Cleat was spiky in a way I’d anticipated Beast of Burden being.Beast of Burden, ‘Bob’, was quick for a guy wearing armor as heavy as his.But we had reinforcements too.At our rear, Capricorn, Rain, and Looksee were arriving.  Looksee had her armor on, much as she’d designed it.  Four spheres at the back of her head, to encapsulate hair buns, five lenses at her face, lime green and gray color scheme.Rain had gone with something relatively simple- a combination of loose clothing with a hood, a mask that made his face look like a robot’s, and gloves that did much the same.  He wasn’t wearing extra arms.Did he look sufficiently different to mask him for Love Lost and Snag?  Nothing about their expressions suggested anything.We were gathered.  All together, or as together as we could reasonably be.  Chris had run off, and Ashley was on the other side, walking the fine line of being hard to manage and believable.“Hey, Mayday,” Looksee said.He was silent, as he turned to look at her.  She had her flash gun out.“Aw shit no,” Mayday said.                                                                                        Shadow – Interlude 5d                                                                                        It’s my night.  No control over what happens.Rain’s senses were flooded with a turpentine-alcohol taste, filling his mouth, then his nose.  People laughed and cheered, and flesh strained around his face.He pulled free of the headlock as the fluid hit his eyes, and leaned over, sputtering, trying to blink the alcohol out of his eyes.  The cheers became more laughter.Rain groaned, facing the ground, and it was a primal sound.  “Are you trying to kill or blind me?”“Ew, you’ve got some fucked up snot,” Nell said.He brought a hand to his nose, and realized the ‘fucked up snot’ was a tendril of snot that was extending from his nose, made more liquid by the caustic, homebrewed alcohol.He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket, caught the snot, and threw it into the fire before leaning back.“Here,” Jay said.  “Drink.”He pushed the glass jug at Rain.  The inside looked almost moldy with the way the pulp clung to the exterior and caught the light.  The contents sloshed within.“If I drink more I’ll be useless tomorrow,” Rain said.“You’re going to be useless no matter what happens,” Allie said, to laughter.“Fuck you,” Rain said.  He felt his face stretch into a smile.“Drink, Rain man,” Jay said, more forcefully.Rain looked up at the guy.  A year older, Jay was tall, his hair shoulder length and blond.  His light facial hair and the smoke of the fire behind him caught the light of the bonfire, but the same light didn’t catch most of his other features.  His eyes weren’t visible.No choice.  Rain took the jug.  He tipped it back, and the taste of it made him cough more.The other teenagers around the fire cheered.“You’re going to be a soldier,” Jay said.  His tone was such that none cheered.  Some knew what it meant to be a soldier, some didn’t, but all respected Jay as the leader of their age group and they knew this exchange was between Jay and Rain.Rain nodded.  His vision shifted slightly as the alcohol made itself felt.  He looked up at Jay, and his eye settled momentarily on the long hair.“I’ll be a soldier,” Rain said.  “The Bible talks about the end times, it talks about armies springing forth, powers, and the deaths of the unworthy.  Everything that happened and happens, the Dragon, the Harlot, the seven bowls, and the armies, with all of the soldiers… even the bad stuff is all God’s will and God’s doing.”“God’s will,” some others echoed.“People have to step up to be soldiers in those armies,” Rain said.Not original words, but they were accepted as truth by the group.  Some believed wholeheartedly, and it was clear in their eyes.  Others were newer, unfamiliar with it, but they played along.  As they heard the voices of people who truly believed, they would hear it and start to come around.  Such was the intent.The Rain of the past, as he spoke the words, believed.Jay reached over, and put his hand at the side of Rain’s head, fingers in Rain’s hair, where it had started to grow out.“Put the fear of God in them,” Jay said.  “And you watch my back.”“Yeah,” Rain said.  “We’ll give ’em hell.”Jay let go of his head, refused to take the jug back, and walked around the circle, attention on others.Time passed.  He could remember a lot of the thoughts he had, as he’d looked at people.  He wasn’t the only person who was earning his stripes as a soldier.  Others, he knew, would be there, and he’d looked at each of them, powered and unpowered, thinking about whether he could trust them, what to watch out for.  Barnabas was violent and could never stop when he got riled up.  Hiram hated Rain because Tabitha, the girl Hiram had liked, had liked Rain.  It didn’t matter that Rain had never reciprocated or liked her back.  Hiram might even take an excuse to hurt Rain, if he had one.  Rain had thought about how he’d try not to be alone with the guy.They ended up together anyway.  Hiram was a good soldier and he asked for Tabitha.  Now she’s pregnant with his kid, and she pretends to be happy.Helps that I’m on the lowest rung of the totem pole.More time passed.  Rain felt the alcohol even through the dream, laughed more than necessary at a few of the jokes from people in the sidelines.He looked at Erin, who was sitting on the other side of the fire, talking to Jay, shaking her head.  He’d sat where he sat because it gave him a better view of her.Delilah got up from her seat, hands filled with the blanket she’d draped over her lap, and sat down next to Rain.  “Give me a drink?”Rain hefted the jug.  It was heavy enough that he had to help Delilah manage it, controlling its tilt so she wouldn’t have it all slosh into her mouth, as Jay had done to him.“Oh, gawd, that’s awful,” Delilah said.Rain offered the jug to others in arm’s reach.  When nobody took it, he set it down on the ground by their feet.  The fire’s light illuminated the contents.Firewater, he thought.  He’d thought it at the time, though it was closer to moonshine.“Here,” Delilah said.  She held out the blanket.“I’m warm enough,” he said.  Even in the dream, he felt the alcohol warming him from within, the heat of it, the buzz.  Everything was fuzzy around the edges and his stomach felt ready to revolt if he moved, so he didn’t move.“Here,” she said, again.  She scooted closer, until her side pressed against his.  “I’ll make you warmer.”He didn’t resist as she arranged the blanket over their laps.  He didn’t resist either as she slowly undid his zipper beneath the blanket.  Everyone around the fire was talking, the fire had died down and nobody was stoking it or replacing the wood.  Some people had started home.She took him in her hand, easing him out past the zipper, and he made sure to fix the blanket so nothing was apparent.“My brother,” she said.  “He’s going out for the first time too.”Rain nodded.“Protect him?”“If we’re even in the same place, sure,” he said, trying to sound normal.  He glanced at Erin.I’d been so worried about what she thought.They sat like that for a bit, her hand moving.  The fire snapped loudly, as a log broke, and they both jumped.Nobody saw or cared.  Delilah’s hand moved again beneath the blanket.Rain let his head move, leaning it on her shoulder, nose and mouth in her hair.  She smelled good.“Talk to me,” Delilah said.“What do you want me to say?”“Tell me you’re a good soldier.”“I’m a good soldier,” he said.  His mind had been a blank.“Some imagination, please.  Tell me what you’ll do.”“That’s what you like?” he asked, almost incredulous, but he couldn’t put much incredulity in his words without heads turning their way.He felt her hair move as she nodded, and he definitely felt her finger move.“I’ll make them beg for mercy,” he said.“Work your way up to that,” she said.  “And you’ll make them beg for God to save them.”“I’ll make them bleed,” he whispered.  She nodded fiercely.  He added, “I’ll make them cry.”“Weep,” she said.  “Better word.”“You’re so fucked up,” he said.“Keep going.  If you stop, I stop.”“We’ll make them think they’re already in Hell, with the fear and the pain,” he whispered.“That’s good,” Delilah said.  “That’s imaginative.”“It’s stuff I’ve heard all my life.”“Are your aunt and uncle your real family?”“I think so.  I don’t know,” He said.  Rain could remember how weird it had felt to be talking family while in this situation.  “My mom called my aunt her sister when we lived in the same places, which wasn’t always.  I know I’m related to a lot of people here.”“Not me,” Delilah said.  Her face brushed against his as she pressed her mouth to his shoulder and bit him lightly.Near Jay and Erin, Allie stood from the log stump she was using as a seat.  She took a second to gather her guitar and sling the strap over her shoulder.Rain put a hand on Delilah’s, telling her to stop for a moment.Allie approached.  She looked at Rain and Delilah, eye dropping to the blanket, and rolled her eyes, whites visible in the gloom.“You good?” Allie asked.“I’m great,” he said, terse.  “Obviously.”“Obviously.  My prayers are with you tomorrow.  I might not see you before you go.”“Thank you.”“My prayers are with Joel too,” Allie said.“Thank you,” Delilah said.  “We’ll talk tomorrow, okay?”“Do you want to meet?  We can keep an ear out for word on how things go, watch the news.”“Allie,” Rain said.  More terse than before, he said, “Go.”Allie smiled, smug, and sauntered off, guitar bouncing behind her.“Can I keep going?” Delilah asked.  “I have to be up early, but I want to send off at least one soldier.”“That’s one way of putting it,” Rain said.In the dream, he was warm in many ways, face flushed, buzzing with the strong alcohol, head pounding in time with his heartbeat, and a good feeling suffused him.In the dream, as he went through it again, there was none of the psychological, where it was divorced from the physical.  He despised himself a little for succumbing to his instincts in this moment, he’d never even especially liked Delilah.  He agonized over if Erin would notice anything, because he liked Erin.  Even back then, he’d gotten along with her little brother.And above all else, he dreaded what came the next day.⊙It was a sunny day as they climbed out of the little bus and the trucks.  Rain watched as a few people in the parking lot looked their way, saw the tattoos, the shirts with crosses on them, and the masks.The people turned the other way, changing their minds about their plans to go into the shopping center.  They would, Rain knew, agonize over what to do, whether to call for help.  The Fallen appeared here and there, sometimes only to make their presence known, only causing trouble on the rarer occasions.In a matter of hours from this point, weeping, these people would be talking to the news cameras, saying they should have seen what happened and called.Rain fixed his mask.  It was hard plastic.  A demon’s face.“You,” Seir said.  He had his horse’s head on, and heavy black clothes that left his arms bare, where he’d wrapped chains around them.  He indicated Rain.  “Special job.”He never liked me, Rain thought.  Something about family ties, old grudges he can’t resolve because some people aren’t around anymore.But he’d listened.  Rain went with Seir, looking back at the others.They went around the side of the shopping center.  One employee was out the side, smoking.  A teenager of Rain’s age, slightly overweight, her hair tucked under a flat-top cap with a visor at the front.Her eyes on her phone, cigarette at her mouth, she didn’t see them.Seir raised a hand.  There was a sound, halfway between a rumble and drumming, almost a stampede, and curling lines of black spilled from Seir’s palm.  The dozen or so lines didn’t curl so much as they bounced, each moving in a smooth half or quarter circle before stopping, curving back or at a right angle to carry on its way.Where they hit solid surfaces, they exploded into rough silhouettes of Seir, mask and all.  Each was as black as the lines – like gaps in reality rather than mere black that absorbed the light of the sun.  Each had eyes that glowed as they looked around- one human eye where it peered through the horse’s eye socket, and one of the horse’s eyes.One, twenty feet above the ground, tore the security camera from the corner of the building.  Another appeared beside the store employee, who was running now that she’d heard the sound and saw them.  It snatched her up.Seir became shadow, and the figure with the girl in its arms became Seir.Others were turning over trash cans, breaking glass in car windows.  Ten in all.  The ones that finished doing their damage disappeared.Rain continued walking.  He could feel his heart pounding.“Bad for you,” Seir said, wrestling the girl around and taking the cigarette.  He took a puff.  “Are you bad?  Are you a sinner?”“Please,” she said.“Open,” Seir said.“What?”“Open wide!” Seir screamed the words.She opened her mouth and kept it open.  Seir took another puff, still holding her, his face next to hers.  Rain could see her trembling.He could remember how he’d felt.  Uneasy.Seir held the cigarette, only half burned, and held it up in front of her face.  Then he flicked it into her mouth, hard enough it had to have hit the back of her throat.  His hand caught her before she could spit it out, and he held his hand firm over her mouth.It took what had felt like a minute before she stopped struggling and went still in Seir’s grip.  Only fifteen or twenty seconds.When Seir held her by only one wrist, she didn’t fight.  Her eyes were wide, terrified.“Spit on her,” Seir said.Rain spat on the girl’s face.If I’d hesitated even a fraction of a second, he would have destroyed me and said he was justified doing it.“Give me an excuse,” Seir said.  “Fuck up one time.”“I’m not going to fuck up,” Rain said.“I’m giving you an easy job,” Seir said.  “You won’t have much of a chance, but I think you’ll manage to fuck it up anyway.”He dragged the girl, jerked her arm when she wasn’t fast enough.  Her hand went away from her face to wipe away the spit, and Seir shook her hard.“Leave it there,” he said.  She did.  Seir looked back, and said, “Kid, what do you think you’re doing?  Open the fucking doors.”Rain opened the double-set of metal doors.  Rain could see within, see the plaza on the far, far end of the hallway, the signs on either side, and the stacked tables and pallets, people walking this way and that, going about their days.Rain heard a muffled shriek.  Three shadowy Seirs hauled the girl off her feet, the fourth holding her hair and mouth.She was lifted up until she was horizontal to the ground, then forced to the ground.“Make a sound,” Seir said, “And I’ll kill you.  Stay.”Fingers knotted in her hair, Seir held the hair and let the doors swing shut, trapping the hair there.  He stepped on it for good measure, straightening with a grunt.The man took a chain from around his arm and wound it through and around the door handles, squares of sheet metal, and hauled the chains tight.  He rummaged, and a moment later, came up with a padlock.  He put it through several of the chains to keep it tight, but left it unlocked.“You’re guarding the door,” Seir said.“I wanted to do more,” Rain said.Did I?  Rain wondered.  His old self was so long ago, so far away.“Cry about it.  We’re scaring the shit out of them.  Step one in scaring the shit out of them is not letting them escape.  Got it?  Let any of them go, you’re not going to get another shot at being a soldier.”He reached a hand out for Rain.  Rain knocked it away, then backed up a step.“Don’t disappoint us, boy,” Seir said.  “You know how fucking bad it is to disappoint us.”“The only disappointment today is that I’m left guarding a door.”Seir snorted.Black lines flowed up from Seir’s head and shoulders, arcing and bouncing off the wall on their way to the roof.Seir took the place of one of his shadow selves, leaving a shadow on the ground.  It lunged at Rain, and Rain jumped back.Only a feint.  The shadow looked like it was snickering, then disappeared.Rain gave the now-absent Seir the finger.Then he was left to wait.  He stared down at the hair that still stuck through the door, stuck there.Someone at the corner of the building walked out to their car.  Rain turned away, hiding his masked face.The day was slightly overcast, but the sun was bright.  Rain fidgeted, back to the wall, hood up and head down.  When the explosion hit, he could feel it through the walls of the building.He looked down at the hair.The door jumped, chains clacking and screeching against the metal of the door handles.  Rain stepped back.He heard the thuds, the pounding of fists on the metal, and the first of the shouts.  As the thuds escalated, his own heartbeat picked up.  He could feel the rush, hear the pounding of his blood in his ears joining the cacophony from the hallway.He could make out the words, the pleas.His hands went to the chain, traveling along it to the lock.  He could feel each push from the people on the other side, until the pushing stopped outright.Not because the people had stopped, but because there was so much pressure that it wasn’t possible to pull the door back.He looked up, for Seir, then to the side, and he gripped the lock.His hand fell to his side.He could hear people screaming and shouting, and he closed his eyes.  There were still thuds on the door, pounding fists.  Those, too, came to a stop.Just the outward pressure on the door, and sounds from people further inside.An interminable amount of time seemed to pass.On the other side, he heard the scream he now knew to be Love Lost’s.A huff of noise left his mouth, more cough than anything.  He brought a shaking hand to his face, and his vision jerked, spasmed.His hand fell again, grazing chain, and he stepped back.  No longer muffled, the laugh left his lips.  It didn’t stop, continuing when he couldn’t draw in the air properly, small, hysterical, wild.He sucked in a breath, almost pulled himself together, and then the laugh came out again, while his hand pressed against the door.He was still laughing some time later, when Seir appeared.  The man created a shadow near Rain, took its place, and shoved Rain down.“Fucking moron!” Seir swore.  “This is supposed to scare them, not kill them!  How the fuck do you think we’re supposed to clue them into the power of God, goodness and badassness both, if they’re all fucking dead!?”Rain’s mad laughter continued.Seir kicked him, hard, in the stomach.  It didn’t make the laughter stop, but it did make it quieter.Seir hauled on the chains, then used his shadow selves, and began tearing at the door, breaking the chains with the strength of the shadows and the help of the pressure on the other side.Rain’s laughter died as the handles shattered with the force.  Fragments of flat, shattered metal skittered along the pavement, alongside some pieces of chain.  The doors were open.People had to climb over others.  They flinched as Seir’s shadows tore at the pole that stood between he doors, then tore more at the frame, opening the aperture wider.People stumbled out, and smoke followed them.Rain started to climb to his feet, then fell, his hand going to his stomach.Seir shot him a look, then created his shadow copies, and went to the roof.Rain climbed to his feet, hand at his stomach, and found himself staring down the crowd, angry, hostile.  His hand had been near his mouth from the laughter, and now it touched his mask.He could feel the instant the trigger hit him like a bucket of cold water being sloshed over him.⊙Rain found himself in the room, awash in self-loathing.  Bending down, he reached for his chair.Stumbling, he dropped to one knee, hand on the loose floorboards and pine needles below.No chair.No, it wasn’t where it was supposed to be.  It was ten feet away, lying on its side, broken.  The lighting in the room was different. Almost everything had been scattered to the ground, damaged, or both.They invited someone.He lurched to his feet, looking around.  In Snag’s area, a shelving unit collapsed noisily, metal shelves falling.  Snag cursed in his characteristic growl.Snag emerged from among the shelves, giving a wide berth to some bent shelves that leaned precariously.  He looked at Rain, then looked away, scowl etched around his eyes.  To Cradle, he said, “This may have been a mistake.”Cradle emerged from the shadows around his area.  His fingers traced broken construction, the concrete slabs had cracks running through them.  More worrisome, however, was the fact that the invisible wall that rested between Cradle and Love Lost was streaked with blood, which ran down in thick, chunky globs.At the base of the wall, a body so mangled it barely looked human was slumped against the wall.Love Lost approached it, and knelt down beside the corpse.It’s like an intense fight happened while the rest of us were off dreaming, and this person lost hard, Rain thought.“This is going to be a hassle,” Cradle said.  “She brought bodyguards.”“Do you need help?” Snag asked.“I took precautions when Love told me old one-tooth here was dangerous.  Fuck.  Fixing our situation is going to be hard if the powers lash out at the people who get involved.”“Do you want one or not?” Snag growled.“Give me one.  I might need to make a run for it.”Snag passed one piece of glass over to Cradle.Mama Mathers, Rain thought.  He braced himself for the appearance, and saw nothing.  He scanned the room, looking.  Too much to hope that it would have brought her in, for the same treatment the one-toothed woman had been given.Emotionally, after his visit with Mama Mathers, after the dream, he felt raw.  There was a part of him that wanted to break down in tears.  But to show weakness?Blood still worked its way down the invisible barrier.  It was responsible for some of the altered color in the room.  Where others’ spaces had been cast in shades of blue and purple, it was now redder.The others would discuss, they’d share out powers, while leaving Rain out of the loop, and then they would go back to trying to kill him.  Rain, meanwhile, would wake up and find himself where he’d been the night before.  Mama Mathers would watch his every move.“I need help,” he said.The looks on their faces.  Hate, hate, and a cold stare through scratched-up glasses.  His heart sank.“There are people with the Fallen who need help.  Innocents.  The Fallen- they use powers to force us to act a certain way, keep us from leaving.  There are-” Rain started.  He looked at Love Lost.  “There are kids at risk.”Love Lost’s hand went out.  She punched the barrier between them with enough force that something in her hand audibly broke.  She trembled with a mixture of pain and sheer loathing as she lowered her hand.The hand would heal when they woke up, but still- to go that far.“There are kids who are being forced to comply with powers.  The ones who aren’t brainwashed the usual way are made to obey with powers.”“Convenient excuse,” Cradle said.“In that dream, I wasn’t under the influence of any powers except for a watchful eye,” Rain said.  “She was observing me back then, but it doesn’t appear in the dream.”“Shut up,” Cradle said.  “Stop.  We hear this every five-”“I’m desperate!” Rain raised his voice, advancing.  “It’s bad.”“Good,” Snag said.Love Lost nodded.“Suffer,” Snag said.“Innocents are going to die, or worse!  I can give you information on the Fallen.  You can use it to stop them.”“We’re not going to cooperate with you,” Cradle said.  “Anyone else, but not with you.”“I can tell you where they are, I can tell you how they operate.”“No.”Emotionally ragged, Rain almost opened his mouth to mention Erin.“I’ll- if you cooperate, if you save these people-”Save Erin.  Save her brother.  Save Lachlan.They’re going to force me to go to the team.  They’ll find out about them.  If they get their hooks in Tristan- in Sveta?  Kenzie?His teeth chattered with emotion.“We’re not going to help you,” Cradle said.“If you do,” Rain said, “I’ll do what you want.  Tie me to a chair, torture me for days.  Kill me.  But save them.”Love Lost shook her head, looking away.“We’re going to come after you,” Cradle said.  “Could be tomorrow, could be a week, could be a year.  Then we’ll do that anyway.  If you’ll lose people and things you care about in the meantime?  Good.  And you can know we let it happen because of your fucked up attitude infecting us.”“Fuck you,” Rain said.  “Whoever or whatever you were before, it wasn’t normal or good.  People staring at you with disappointed looks from across a desk, looking at reports?  What was it?  Because you weren’t living up to potential?  You’re proving them right.”Cradle didn’t flinch.  “You don’t know anything.”Rain clenched his fist.  He looked at Love Lost.  “Your daughter would be disappointed in you.”She raised her other fist, ready to punch the barrier again.“Don’t take the bait,” Snag said.  “Don’t give him that satisfaction.”“If you got anything from me, it wasn’t evil,” Rain said.  “It was willful blindness, being fucking sheep with no self-esteem or self-respect.  What happened to that Snag that helped that girl?”It was Cradle who answered, “You guarded the door while he was trampled on the other side, and you laughed.  You see what we went through in our dreams, but you were the one getting a drunken handjob and laughing while we faced the worst days of our lives.”“It was panic,” Rain said.“Fuck that.”“It was panic.  It was a nervous reaction!”“Fuck that,” Cradle said, dismissive.  “We’ve heard it before, but-”“Why do you think my share of the powers breaks things apart?  They’re thematically tied into who we are!  And my share is to shatter things because I was fucking shattered, right then!”“It’s a power to destroy because you destroy things.  Do you know how I know?” Cradle asked.  “Because you fucking told us.  Day one.  You, me, him, her, in this room.  You laughed.  You told us we deserved it.  You threatened us.”“Kill me, then.  Stop the Fallen, kill the monsters at the top, like Seir, and then kill me.”“We’ll do all that without your help,” Snag said.  “Give us time.  Wait for it, dread it.”Rain was shaking.  He approached the dais.  He found the his shards of metal.He snatched them up and gripped them as a stack in his hand.He turned his back to the dais, the three others, and the mangled body.⊙Fingers ran through Rain’s hair.“Shhh.  Easy.”He closed his eyes.  All of the aches and pains, the soreness in his throat from vomiting, and the more physical side of his emotional exhaustion were making themselves felt with every beat of his heart.  Sunlight streamed in through the window of the machine shop.“Rain.”He startled, flipped over, and scrambled away from Mama Mathers, her fingernails scraping his scalp.  She knelt on the ground by where he had been sleeping.His back was to the wall as he stared at everything that wasn’t her.  Looking at the images and hearing them made them last longer.  His prosthetic hands – if he dwelt on the design, focused on the schematics, on the work he needed to do, and the possibilities, if he didn’t think about-Her hand touched the side of his head.  He flinched away, then froze, shaking.He was so tired.  Already, he was on edge.“You’re going to show me what you’ve been up to.  Show me the progress you’ve made in preparing to kill the others with matching powers,” Mama Mathers said.He stared at the sunlight that came in through the window, the dust in the air illuminating it.  More dust and sawdust on the floor had patterns where footsteps had left tracks.  Clothes had been layered over a bag to serve as a kind of pillow.  Erin’s sweatshirt.  There was a wet spot where he’d drooled on it.“Don’t disappoint me,” Mama Mathers said.He made his way to his feet, his bruises and aches from his encounter with his uncle not helped by his sleeping on the hard floor.  He bent down to get the bag, picked up the sweatshirt, and folded it so his drool wasn’t too obvious.Was Erin safe?  She-Mama Mathers was in the corner of his vision.  Even his suspicion about who was responsible if Erin wasn’t safe was enough to bring her to bear.She would have had to go home.  Her parents were fanatic enough they’d excuse almost anything, but he couldn’t imagine her staying all night.A note sat on the table, beneath a connector tab from one of the digit manipulation systems he’d been working on.  He really wished Erin hadn’t moved it- just the fact that it wasn’t in order meant another ten or fifteen minutes of work.Not that she could have known.You sleep like you’re dead.  It’s freaky.



See you in the morning, bud.  We’ll figure something out.



~Erinnn~The name was penned out in an exaggerated cursive, the ‘n’ exaggerated and drawn out long with a dwindling series of dips and raises.Bud.He touched the name and realized he still had her sweatshirt.He wanted to hold it to his face and inhale, only because he felt so desperate and alone that he wanted any connection that wasn’t- wasn’t her.Mama Mathers approached the window and looked outside.He might have wanted and done the same connection if it was a boy.  If it was Byron, or Tristan.  Not because he was that way, but…He didn’t have much.There was a knock at the door.  He reached for the note, folded it, and put it in his pocket.“Come in.”Erin.  She’d showered, and she had a stack of lunchboxes under her arm.  Three.  She wore a t-shirt with a blurry skull design bleached onto the front, crosses for eyes and separating the teeth, jeans, and high boots.“What’s that?” he asked, indicating the lunchboxes.“Food.  I asked my mom for breakfast to go, and lunch too, and she went overboard.  I thought after a day like yesterday, you might want to take it easy.  Hot breakfast, coffee in a thermos, and some lunch for later.”“And the other?” he asked.  His voice was more hoarse than it had a right to be.  He felt the disparity between dusty, injured, weary himself and clean, beautiful, vivacious Erin.“Breakfast for me, duh.”“Oh,” he said.  His thoughts went in the wrong direction.  Mama Mathers paced the length of the room.His life wasn’t his anymore.“You can crash in your workshop today, figure your things out.  If you want dinner, I can bring that to you too.”“I have to go,” he said, aware of Mama Mathers’ stare.  “I need to talk to the others, and I need to deal with my cluster.”“Okay,” Erin said.  “I can drive you.”“You don’t need to.”“I can drive you.  It’s fine.  When do you want to go?”“As soon as possible?  I need to shop for stuff, for my hands, and I want to stop by the library.  We could eat on the road.”“Perfect,” she said.  “I’m ready to go, so get your stuff.”He nodded, stiff.“Can I?” she asked.  She pointed.Tired, dazed, trying not to think, he was momentarily dumbfounded.She pointed with more intensity, until he looked down.  Her sweatshirt.He handed it to her, then turned to get his arms together.  His stuff hadn’t been touched from the night prior, but there was other stuff he wanted to bring, just in case.“Did you jerk off onto my sweatshirt?”He looked at Erin, stunned.  He looked at the wet spot of drool.“I- no.  Drool,” he said.  “Sorry.”“Fuck, you look like you just ran over my dog.  I was joking, I wanted to try to get a smile out of you.”She smiled, encouraging.He opened his mouth, then closed it.  He was so far from smiling, he couldn’t even process the idea.  He was all too aware that Mama Mathers was watching the exchange.“Oh, honey,” she said.  “I’m sorry.”“Sorry,” he said, again, automatically.“It’s okay.  Let’s get on the road and get the stuff you need.”He nodded.  He followed behind her, firmly shutting the door behind him, and the smell of breakfast was intoxicating.  He felt hollow inside, in more ways than one, and the idea of food to fill him up, after throwing up, after missing meals, with only candy and caffeine to tide him over, it made him almost delirious, his thoughts momentarily freed of the trap of thinking, not-thinking.But thinking about the trap only brought her out again.  She stood on the street, looking around, as he got into Erin’s dad’s car.He took the boxes, opened his, and started eating immediately.  “Thank you.”“My mom’s a good cook,” she said.  “I did the pancakes, because they’re easy.  Made properly, not out of a box.”“It’s the best thing I ever tasted,” he said.As the car rolled down the dirt road, he could see the camp outside the window.  People who were only just waking up, meeting in town to eat at the communal dining hall, or borrowing what they needed to harvest crops or do a day’s worth of building.“So, silly story, bear with me.”“Silly story sounds good.”“My brother and I, we had a game we’d play a year or so ago, when we were new here and there wasn’t much to do.  A series of codes and signals.”Rain nodded.  He worried he was too tired to process anything complicated, but Bryce was young.“Some of it was so we were on the same page, and if our parents were being especially kooky we could touch our hair near the right ear.  It was a good way to stay sane without making them upset or defensive.”“Okay.”“And the other sign, it was folded arms.  We couldn’t do it all the time, or it’d be obvious, and we’d obviously have to change the subject.”“I don’t follow.  You’d cross your arms when-”“Be careful when you eat the sausage, by the way.  It’s handmade, but it has gristly bits in it that will do a number on your teeth.  I swear they’re bone shards, they’re that tough,” Erin said.Rain looked at her.  He made the connection, realized what she was doing.Mama Mathers was in the back seat, leaning forward, and Rain folded his arms.“Yeah,” Erin said, with emphasis.  “Exactly.  It’s miserable, because my dad loves the things.  I can’t mention it, you know.  I haven’t been able to since we first arrived here and that was first dropped on my plate.  He’ll get super defensive, and my mom keeps making them and giving them to Bryce and I.”The rest was filler.  Rain processed what Erin had intended to say, things he mostly knew.The folded arms were to tip the other off that Mama Mathers was looking.  It was more of a concern for Rain than for Erin.  Erin’s introduction to the woman had been fleeting.  New visitors that were brought in as serious residents were given a glimpse of her, and a bit of a listen of her voice.  Most didn’t even realize what had happened, until they broke a rule.The effect was weaker, only kicking in if Mama Mathers was mentioned by word, written or spoken, or possibly if she was thought about at the same time as a strong emotion was felt.Erin couldn’t tell the others any more than he could, or Erin wouldn’t have been allowed to come.“I’ll eat your sausage if you don’t want it,” he said.“You go right ahead, you madman.”They drove into the city, and his arms were crossed for much of the trip.⊙“Just don’t tell me whatever you end up doing to him, and we’re golden.”“That’s fine,” Snag said, again.In the background, the dog girl approached, the girl in the bodysuit, scarf, and demon mask walking at her side.“Bitch,” Tattletale said.  “This is kind of a clandestine meeting.”“My favorite kind,” the girl in the demon mask said.  Snag startled, his hand raising.  Tattletale moved forward, hand out to rest on top of it.“My recordings do not like this person,” Kenzie said.  “I’m getting a billion and two warning messages.”“Memories don’t track her,” Victoria said.  “She was relatively new when I left Brockton Bay.  Cameras record her better than the eye does, but the footage degrades over time.”“Uuuuugh,” Kenzie groaned.  “This messes up so many things.  Let me reboot.”The screen went dark.“Our memories of this should be fine, unless she’s gotten stronger over time.”“Do powers do that?” Rain asked.“That’s a complicated question with a lot of answers,” Victoria said.  “Kid capes tend to get a better grasp on their abilities than adults do, but that’s partially because they adapt to the agent’s wavelength.  It’s part of what feeds into the myth that kids are stronger.”“Not so much that they’re stronger,” Sveta said.  “Just that there’s less person and more power?”“Something like that,” Victoria said.“I know that reality pretty well,” Sveta said.“There are other things.  Some have hidden uses or nuances that aren’t made obvious to the user.  Most powers are instinctively usable, but there are gaps, sometimes, or things about the power you need to figure out.”“We’re back!” Kenzie announced, as the screen lit up, showing the camera footage, Tattletale’s group all gathered.  “And I have to say I love gothic doll girl’s dress.  That’s awesome.”“Don’t wear a frock, Kenzie,” Tristan said.  “A tinker in a frock would be a travesty.”“Having to keep all that neat and tidy would be a nightmare.  I’d rather spend that time on my cameras.  But she looks awesome.”“Beside her is Flechette.  Was Flechette.  Foil, now that she’s gone over to the dark side,” Victoria said.“Dark side?” Chris asked, from the other end of the room.  He snorted.“Get out of the damn corner and join the conversation, you goon,” Tristan said.“The corner is comfortable.  I can see everything.”See everything.Rain was aware of Mama Mathers, standing on the edge of the group, watching, paying mind to the others.“Good boy,” Mama Mathers whispered in his ear.  “We’ll be ready for them.”He crossed his arms.  Erin wasn’t around, but it was habit, and he worried his hands would shake if he wasn’t careful.Knowing what he’d done to those people in the mall ate at him.  The woman with her hair in the door hadn’t survived.  Others had died in the crush.  Some were children.But Rain knew.  He’d have to kill Mama.He’d have to kill Snag.  He’d have to kill Love Lost.  He’d have to kill Cradle.“I don’t want to go inside,” Bitch said, on the screen.“You came all this way, and you don’t want to go in?”  Tattletale asked.“Across universes,” the girl with the very ironic demon mask commented.“Across parallel worlds,” Tattletale clarified.“I came all this way because you said I had to.”“I said it would be a good idea,” Tattletale said.“And I came.”“It’s a good idea because we all need to be on the same page, and we need intel on all these people we’re going up against.  I meant for you to come to the briefing.”“Briefings are important,” Foil said.  “Especially for something this big.”“Tattletale can tell me before it happens,” Bitch said.“Or you can come in, and you can listen.  It’ll be good for people to know your face.”“I don’t care about those people.  It’s a nice night.  I’ll sit with my dogs and stand guard.”“She’s right,” the girl in the demon mask said.  “I’ll come with you and hang out, if that’s cool.”“No,” Tattletale said.  “For you, it’s absolutely mandatory.”“That’s not fair.”“Life isn’t fair.  Go.  Inside.  Rache, find a nice seat by the water.  Everyone, again, I shouldn’t need to repeat myself, but your antics are making me worry, watch what you say.  They’re listening, and they’re watching.”“You sound paranoid,” Foil said.“Deservedly so,” Tattletale said.  “If you have to say anything about the job, say it indoors.”“Or I can not talk,” Bitch said.“Or that.  Go.  Shoo.  You guys, indoors.  Snuff, watch the cars.”Rain watched as Tattletale herded everyone.“Jesus,” Tristan said.  “These are the guys who took over a city?”“And run one of the most established areas of Gimel,” Victoria said.“I ran into some of them when they came to Cauldron, right on the heels of the Irregulars and the whole mess there,” Sveta said.  “They were there at the end of the world.  They played a big role in it.”“Credit where credit’s due,” Tristan said.Victoria had her own arms folded.  Fingernails bit into her upper arm.  “Give us some intel later, Sveta?  Or do you think that would be unfair?”“I can give some intel.”Tattletale, business done, stepped away, and when she was at the side of the building, nobody in her immediate area, she leaned against the wall.She drew a phone out of her pocket, and pressed it to her ear.  Reaching into her pocket, she pulled out a lighter, but no cigarette.No, Rain realized.  Not a lighter.  It flipped open, but there was only a button on the top.“What is that?” he asked.Kenzie hit keys.  “No phone calls live.”“You’re tracking that?” Sveta asked.“Part of making sure we’re not being listened to.  No biggie.”Tattletale hit the button.“Uuuuugh,” Kenzie groaned.  “What is she doing?  This is messing up other stuff.”“Victoria.”All eyes went to the screen.  It was Tattletale that had talked.“Optics, or whatever you’re calling yourself now.  Capricorn.  Sveta.  Creepy kid.  Boy from the Fallen.  Not sure if I just outed you, but there we are.”“Are we supposed to reply?” Kenzie asked.“I’m creepy kid?” Chris asked.“Cute stunt, alleging I’m working with you.  I’m sure you have camera footage to help build the lie.  Fine.  You win.  You ruined my day and it’s going to be a headache for a while.  This insane grudge you’re nursing?  It’d be great to call it even.”Victoria didn’t move a muscle.“Fifty-fifty odds you’re shaking your head at me right now, G.H.  If you’re not, you’re standing there being all stoic, really wanting to be.  Fine.  Five of you need to butt the fuck out.  The sixth needs to run.  These guys really want him gone, and frankly, after hearing what they had to say, I’d almost cheer them on.”I can’t run, Rain thought.  I would have run a long time ago, if I could.“I know you’re not going to, but if I jumped straight to that, it’d sound too aggressive.  I’m going to be unusually gracious and give you this warning.   Tonight is the briefing.  After that, we’re going to have a war.  Be as far away as possible, be crafty, and maybe they’ll run out of money to pay me before they catch up to you.  If you can’t get away, put as many people you don’t give a shit about between yourself and these guys as you can.  You’ve been staying in the camp for a while, that’s a good place to be.”“She’s giving us advice?” Chris asked.“Mastermind games,” Victoria said.“I’m going to hold nothing back when it comes to finding you, as soon as my contract starts, and I’ll tell them exactly where you are within minutes.  They’ll come after you, they’ll get you, and they’ll do things to you that make me squeamish.  If your friends are in the way, Fallen boy, they’ll probably do the same to them.  I could list off a hundred things I’ve seen and even done that would drive the squeamish point home, about how it’s actually pretty amazing they got me, but this doo-dad is almost out of juice, and I don’t want this recorded or overheard by our friendly clairvoyants.”“Uuugh,” Kenzie groaned.  She mashed the keyboard with her palms.  “That’s what she’s doing.”“Cost me a lot too,” Tattletale said.  “Sorry Optics.  Victoria?  Third time I’ve been really gentle with you or your people.  Kind of hope-”Tattletale stopped.  She smacked the lighter-sized jammer with her hand a few times.  Looking back up to the camera, Tattletale gave it the finger, then turned to walk away.“Thinkers are scary,” Tristan said.“Fuck her,” Victoria said.“Are you okay, Rain?” Sveta asked.“Nothing about that was really news.  Except just how confident she is she’ll find me.”“I think she could say the sky is lime green with confidence,” Victoria said.“I’m… not reassured,” Rain said.“Whatever you want to do, we can back you,” Tristan said.Rain, arms folded, was aware of Mama Mathers.  He looked at her.  He prayed for someone to notice, to put pieces together.  He saw Victoria and Tristan exchange a look.“Come home,” Mama Mathers said.“I’m going to go back,” he said.  He didn’t have much of a choice.“We’re going to help, okay?” Tristan asked.  “This thing is happening, you’ll be over there, we have people on both sides of the conflict, you on the one side, and-”“And an agent on the other,” Rain finished, before Tristan could name names.  “If that group is even part of it.”“They are,” Kenzie said.  “They’re attending the briefing.  A lot of friction.”“This goes down tomorrow, and we will make something happen,” Tristan said.“We’ve got your back,” Sveta said.Rain nodded.  Tired as he was, with only a brief nap in the car to sustain himself, he felt emotional.No words.“I’m going to talk to the Wardens,” Victoria said.  “It’s time.  They’re probably already aware something’s up, this many major players getting together, but I can provide context and get you help.”He nodded again.  He didn’t have it in him to speak.The Wardens wouldn’t want to help him.He walked over to where his stuff was, grabbed the cosmetic things Kenzie had given him, and exited the door.Erin had gone home earlier, at the time of Advance Guard’s appearance.  With all the chaos after, they’d canceled the other plans.  It wasn’t worth it, and the cat was out of the bag.He had the support of the group, potentially the Wardens, of Erin, and even Tattletale giving advice and a head start.He wasn’t sure he deserved it.⊙The ferry-car that Rain had called was jam packed, and the trip was made more uncomfortable by the fact the road into the camp was choked with vehicles.  There were trucks, jeeps, and the barely-intact rush jobs that more enterprising people had put together from scrap, back when they’d needed workhorse vehicles and there hadn’t been enough cars coming out of Earth Bet.  Sheet metal welded together to form car bodies, with Frankenstein interiors and engines.Even after the cars had been available again, the car junkies had kept making the ugly beasts, as a point of pride.He had spent enough time around the other branches that he knew the cliques and groups, the tendencies, styles of dress, and the favored tattoos.  All three sub-groups of the Crowley family were present.  All three brothers.Mama Mathers knew about the attack, because she’d seen what the group had seen.  She’d called in help.Tents were going up, cars were parked on lawns outside houses, to the point it looked like every house was throwing a massive party, and bonfires dotted the dark fields and hills.  Even the forests were eerily illuminated, as whole groups of people were bringing down trees and dividing them into firewood.The Fallen weren’t outnumbered three to one anymore.There were others, Rain saw.  Groups that he didn’t know, but that the Crowleys were no doubt familiar with.  Bikers.  Scattered people from the Clans.If they fended off the initial attack, and they might, Rain knew they would attack back.  They’d hit Cedar Point, wiping it off the map and they’d do a lot of damage to everything between here and there.The truck stopped several times.  Many of the people in the vehicle with Rain were Crowleys, new to the camp, so the truck drove well past the point of the central settlement, to deliver multiple people to each house.It meant, at least, that Rain had transportation direct to his place.  Two guys got out with him.  They were Crowley jackasses- actual titles they wore with pride.“Rain,” Mama Mathers said.  “Stop.”He stopped in his tracks.  The two jackasses gave him a look.  He waved them on.The woman’s hand, spectral as it was, felt real as it touched Rain’s hair.  He flinched, but she persisted.  He remained where he was, head turned away, neck stiff.“This was good,” Mama Mathers said.  “I’ll reward you.”He didn’t move a muscle.“Enjoy your evening, my soldier.  Tomorrow, we show them we’re not to be trifled with.”Rain turned his head, to look for clarification, but she was gone.  There was a distant sound, like a flock of birds taking off.He’d slept on the train, but this whole scene was so surreal.  She’d-He stopped, bracing himself for her appearance.  For the physical contact.She hadn’t appeared.  The sound remained.  A thunderous flapping, far away.Mama Mathers, he thought.There was only the sound.She’d freed him?  For only tonight?Adrenaline coursed through him.  His eyes were wide as he strode forward.  He had- not opportunity, but something.  He walked at a speed that was only a run, passing the jackasses, pushing his way into his aunt and uncle’s house.His aunt and uncle were in the living room, organizing sleeping arrangements for five boys and girls, ages ranging from sixteen to mid-twenties.  Soldiers, like Rain had once been.  Crowleys.  Allie was at the kitchen table, with others her age sitting around her.  Adult women were cooking.He was free, or almost free, and he was surrounded by Fallen.  What was he supposed to do?His aunt spotted him.  Her expression was unreadable, and she shooed him off.His room.  He’d go there, he’d regroup.  If it hadn’t been commandeered to give others a place to sleep.  He had some spare things in his room.  Weapons, traps.  He took the stairs two at a time.Jay’s sister was in the hallway.  Nell.  The house was crowded, but the upstairs had been kept quiet.Nell stared at Rain as she put headphones on.  The stare persisted as he walked past her, her head moving to keep him in her sight.  He was uncomfortably reminded of Love Lost.  This wasn’t hostility, but-Threatening?  Ominous?He opened the door to his room, and let himself in.The room was occupied.Rain swallowed, hard.  “Erin.”Erin sat on his bed.  She didn’t make eye contact, her fingers picking at the blanket she’d put over her lap.She was wearing only a silk nightgown.“They were waiting for me when I drove in, like last night,” Erin said.“No.”“They took me to the big house,” she said.“To the leadership?” he asked.She shook her head.“Elijah?  Valefor?”“To the elders, in the sitting room.  They told me I’m to marry.”Rain swallowed hard.Erin put her hand forward.  When she pulled it back, two simple golden bands were left on the dark wool blanket Rain kept at the foot of the bed.“They’re giving me to you,” she said, her voice lacking inflection.  “If-”“Erin.”“If you want me.”“Not like this.”“Can you hear me out?  Can you let me talk?  Because I’ve been sitting here for hours.  They took me to my house, they made me change.  When I wasn’t dressed how they thought I should dress, they went through my room and picked this out.  This isn’t my choice, so you know.”“I don’t-”“Hear me out?  Please.  Before you say anything and I lose all composure.  I know you’ve helped me out a ton, and I’ve helped you out, but can you do this for me?  Let me talk?”Rain nodded.“I want to do this.  I want to- I want you.  Please.  I thought about it and I’ve been thinking about it as a just-in-case.  They asked me at the big house, they said Mama Mathers wanted to pair you and me, and they asked what I wanted, if it were to happen.  There’s this dilapidated house I think it could be fixed up nice and expanded to be a proper house.  It’s on the outskirts, near the old gate.  It’d be ours.  For us.”“Erin-”“And my parents could move in.  I want them away from everything, not so involved and tied in.  They’ll make them move, and they’ll start being more rational if there aren’t those influences.  You and I together.  I know you don’t want to stay, but we’d barely be part of the community, that far out.”“I can’t.”“Listen,” she said.  She stood from the bed, and he looked away as he realized how short the nightie was.  She scooped up the rings and held them in cupped hands.  “Listen.  Please listen.  I only liked you as a friend, before.  But a few days ago, you gave me a hug, and it was nice.  I started thinking, if it had to be someone, I wanted it to be you.  Once I started thinking like that, I started thinking about how you looked nice.  Kind of 90’s bad boy, with the long hair, ripped jeans and flannel, very Bender in Breakfast Club, except you’re way more attractive than Nick Cage.”“You’re rambling, and-”“I’m terrified,” she said.  She stepped forward, well inside his personal space, until her chest touched his.  He pulled back, back to the closed door, and she didn’t pursue.Instead, her hands went up, fingers pinching at the very edges of his shirt.“Please,” she said.  “You.  My parents.  My brother.  This is the only way I get anything close to a happy ending.”“You need to come with me.  We’ll run.  There’s going to be this war, anyway, and-”She was already shaking her head.“I can’t leave them.  I lost everything.  My family lost everything.  If they lost me too?  If I lost them?  I couldn’t ever.”“This place will destroy you.”“Not if- not if we get that house on the outskirts.  We’ll be far enough away, we won’t have a lot of involvement.  Please.  I see the way you look at me.  I’m not dumb.”“I can’t.”“If you want me barefoot and in the kitchen, I can-”Rain made a face, shook his head, looked away.“No.  I didn’t think you would.  But…”Her presence was overwhelming enough he worried he might do something stupid.  Every look he’d averted, every thought he hadn’t completed, every time he’d jacked off and thought of her, but hadn’t ever been able to let himself imagine a scenario to go along with her, they were things that had been left incomplete, like a hole inside of him.  Love with a missing letter.She was, standing before him, promising that.“That you’d suggest that… isn’t that the destruction I just talked about?  That’s not you.  That’s this fucking place.”Mama Mather’s disconnected presence was like bird’s wings against the exterior of the house, rustling.Erin was barely able to speak and barely audible as she said, “You want this.  I want this.”“Yeah.”“Give me my family, Rain.  Be my family.”“It would destroy you,” he said.She shook her head.“And it would destroy me.  It’s the one thing I can’t do.”She went very still.“I love you, Rain.  I really think I do.  It took me hours sitting in here and considering possibilities, but I do love you.”“I love you too.”“Don’t say that.  Not when you’re also saying no, when they’ll marry me off to someone else instead.”“You need to leave.”“I can’t.”“You need to leave.  You can go.  While everything’s going to pieces, I can get your parents and brother.  The team will.  We’ll kidnap them, we’ll get them out.”He could see the glimmer on her face.  The hope.He could see it die.“If it failed, I’d lose them.  Unequivocally,” she said.  “I can’t risk it.”“Erin-”“I can’t!” she raised her voice.The murmur of discussion downstairs grew quieter.  People were listening now.“I can’t.  The world ended and I have nightmares every night.  I lost friends.  Losing my family will destroy me more surely than anything.”Rain wanted to reply.  He remained silent instead.Something in his expression conveyed what words couldn’t.  Her expression changed.She hit him in the chest, hard.  She hit him again, drumming him with her fists.  He didn’t resist.She stopped, clutched his shirt, and pressed her face to his chest.It was all he could do not to wrap his arms around her in a hug.“This isn’t you,” he said.  “It’s this place.”She pulled away.“You need to leave,” she said, with restrained anger.  “If you say no to this, they’ll want to know why, and the reason why is that you aren’t loyal.”She wasn’t wrong.He stepped away.  He approached the window, and he looked outside before creating his silver blades.“I’d die for you,” he said.  “But I can’t be Fallen.”“Then fucking die, Rain.”He cut into the bedroom window with his blades.  With a strong tap, he let the glass fall to grass below.If it hadn’t been his day, he wasn’t sure he’d have had the precision to cut like that, or the ability to so easily tap it out, without breaking the glass.He hit the ground, and he started running.⊙Rain punched the numbers into the keypad.  He was on the train, and he had no destination to travel to.  He couldn’t go to the others.  He couldn’t go back to the camp.His finger traveled over the number pad.  One, seven, four, six, nine, three, and M.The numbers painted out a letter on a conventional number pad.  He’d just drawn out ‘H’.Nine, seven, four, six, four, one, three, and D.  He’d drawn out ‘E’.Seven, one, three, and N.  ‘L’.‘P’ was the last letter.  One, seven, nine, six, four and S.The letters were a code of their own.  An incomplete word or phrase.He sent the message, and he waited, staring at the phone.He got his reply.  A text: 9713A97139E17593S9746413YHe translated it.  ‘Come’.  Letters: A, E, S, Y.  Put together with his, ‘Madness’ and the stray Y.In plain text, he asked ‘where’?In code, he got his reply.  It was lengthy enough it had to have been pre-prepared.  An address.It took him an hour to get there.  A dark part of the city, where the power hadn’t been kept on.A door as opened.  Candles were lit within.The woman who faced him was petite, and wore a rabbit mask with a uniform that looked like a soldier from the 1800s.  A rapier dangled from her waist.“March,” he said.Wordless, she invited him to come in.  He did.  Further inside, he could see others.  A trio of people.  Another pair.Other clusters.“I’m out of options,” he said.“You know what I want,” March said.“Foil.  Flechette.  From your cluster. I’ve seen her.”“I’ve been planning on dealing with her and her acquaintance Tattletale for some time now.  It puts me in a unique position to help you.”“You want her to die.”“That discussion can wait until tomorrow.  For now, you look like you need to sleep.”Heartbroken, exhausted, he couldn’t bring himself to say no.⊙He dreamed, and the dream slipped from memory as soon as he entered the room.Rain bent down for the chair, found it in its usual place, and set it on the ground.There was no discussion.  The others stood, Snag approached the dais.  Love Lost hung back.  Cradle paced.Rain sat, and he watched.  After so many hard days and nights, he felt eerily calm.Not so much left to lose, in a way.It dropped from the sky, and it bounced on the tip of the crystal spike that stood up from the center of the dais.  A token.  A coin, flipping in air, a shard of metal as it showed its other side.  A tooth, shadow moving across it as it rotated in the air.  A piece of glass.It bounced on the point of crystal with eerie accuracy, landed, wobbled, and then slid to one side, breaking apart as it slid.  Rain stood, and he approached the dais.He pushed everything else aside, and he collected his shards of metal.With them, a piece of glass and a coin.Today mattered.  The others’ expressions were trying not to betray anything, but they were bothered.I’ll see you tomorrow, Rain thought.  And at least one of us here is going to die.                                                                                        Shadow – 5.6                                                                                        Sveta tugged my arm, dragging me off the train.  The sky was dark and the lights of the city were at their deceptive stage where so few apartments and buildings were lit up that it looked like it was four in the morning, not seven in the evening.“Come on,” she urged, tugging.“There’s stuff to do before everything happens tomorrow,” I said.  “I really want to, but plans.”“Change your plans.  You need to talk to the Wardens, right?”“I was planning on doing a write-up I can bring with.  I sent an email before we got on the train, I’d have to get my computer or phone out to see if they responded already.”“Come on.  Talk to Weld.  We’ll work something out for the rest.”More to keep us from getting in other people’s way, I let Sveta drag me out onto the train platform.  We stood outside the train while people got on.  I had only a minute to decide if I’d do what I wanted to do, which was to go with Sveta, or if I’d do what I needed to do, which was to prepare for an imminent war that too few people seemed to be aware of.Lots of the people were staring or glancing at Sveta, with her unusual body.  The noises that body made as she tugged at me drew as much attention as the colorful suit.“Let me check my phone?” I asked.  “It might change what I’m doing.”“Okay.”The connection was slow as I waited for my email to load, the diamond shape in the center of the blank page folding into itself endlessly in the ‘loading’ loop.I sighed a little as the train doors closed and the train went on its way.“Don’t sigh at me, Victoria,” Sveta said.  “The train doesn’t matter.  You can fly.”“People make fun of you on the internet if you get caught on camera while browsing your phone or laptop while flying.  I wanted to sit and chat with you about dumb, meaningless stuff-”“Which we thoroughly did.”“-and then spend the rest of the trip typing notes.”“I used to admire that side of you.  It was a good thing when you were doing the physio, and when you were watching those videos of university classes.  Which were incredibly boring, I’m sorry.”“They were the highlight of my day.”“They were so boring.  I don’t know how you make powers boring, but they managed.  But you had the mental fortitude to push through it.”“I enjoyed it,” I said.  “Really.”“But I’m worried about that attitude now.  If I had real hands I’d reach up and feel your shoulders to see how tense you are.”I relaxed my shoulders as casually and naturally as possible.“If you’re stiffer than the girl with the prosthetic body and her metal boyfriend, you need to relax.  Spend some time with me and Weld.  We’ll talk about tomorrow.”“I need to call Crystal first.”“Invite her!” Sveta said.  She reached out and jostled my arm roughly.  “Bring her.  Tristan was going to come by later with some stuff for me, when he has his turn again.  He’ll have updates.  We can make it a little leadership meeting.”She looked so happy at the notion.“I’ll ask if she’s interested,” I conceded.“I’ll have to figure out what we’ll eat,” Sveta said, in an almost sing-song, happy way.My phone finally loaded.  I had messages and emails.  I ignored them and sent one to Crystal.Me:



Sveta’s trying to drag me to dinner with her and Weld.  You want to come?“I’m not trying to drag you,” Sveta said, as she set her chin down on my shoulder.“You were literally dragging me.”Best Cousin:



yes!  where?  what do I bring?“Nothing,” Sveta said.  “We’ll have to order in.”Me:



Blue binder from the coffee table.  It has a magazine cutout taped to front.“That’s not nothing,” Sveta said.Best Cousin:



I meant food u dumbass“I like her,” Sveta said.“People are feeling abusive today,” I said.  “Something in the air.”I told Crystal not to bring food, then typed out the address as Sveta recited it.  I left the message typed in the box.“Address is right.  Hit send,” Sveta said.“We’ll compromise,” I said.  “Because I have about a hundred things I’ve been keeping in the back of my mind, and I had everything arranged in my head so tonight would be the night I pulled it together.”“What’s the compromise?”“I need to get organized.  If we’re not getting some stuff done for tomorrow, I’ll cut out a bit after dinner, and we’ll do it another time.”“Deal.  I think you’ll find we’re better at balancing the cape stuff with the real stuff.  In a way, it’s all mixed up for us already.”“Alright,” I said.  “Yeah.”She hugged my arm.  “Send a message to Weld, too?  Let him know?”I did.“This way,” she said.  She walked with a bit of a bounce in her slightly ungainly step.  I wasn’t sure she would have been able to if she wasn’t holding onto me.Stratford station and the surrounding neighborhood were an area of the megalopolis I primarily knew for its airfield.  Helicopters were in and out, and as someone who often had to fly past, I had to be mindful of the airspace.  I usually flew low or gave it a wider berth, using the highway to the north as my guide.Now that I was in the neighborhood and moving at a walking pace, I could see it was one of the quainter areas.  It was one of the first areas to be settled, and the buildings were smaller, with more houses.  Not too dissimilar to my mom’s neighborhood.  Even the apartment buildings were three or four floors tall at the highest.  Like many of the buildings in the early settlements, they’d been built broad rather than tall.My phone buzzed and I checked it.I had two messages, excepting the six others I had from Kenzie.The first was from the Wardens.  They wanted to talk at ten thirty in the evening.  Committee.  Team heads would be there.I showed Sveta.“Damn.  We can’t spend that long together,” she said.“We do have things to do.”“I know,” she said.I sent a copy of the message with the time to the others.The other was from Ashley: Dark Damsel Ashley:



At my apartment with BoB henchmen to get my things and talk to landlord.  Moving to apartment in BoB territory.  Taking chance to send message while away from the c-voyants.She’d sent the message to everyone.I reported, “Ashley’s moving into Cedar Point, which I’m not sure I would have recommended, but she seems to know what she’s doing.”“She’s doing fine,” Sveta said.“She’s doing exceptionally, when it comes to the acting.  If that’s acting.  The way she’s letting these people see where she lives and she’s taking her stuff to Cedar Point, when it might be the site of some fighting?  Or infighting?  That’s where I might have given her other advice.”“The way she’s unreservedly going forward might make it more believable.”I nodded.  “She’s in Stratford, isn’t she?  We could bump into her.”“Other direction from the station, but yeah.”“Do you meet or anything?  It’s hard to picture you guys together without the group.”“We’ve met a couple of times.  Um.  Mr. Armstrong came by twice, and he invited us all to lunch.”“Weld’s foster dad, kind of.”“Kind of.  And he looked after Ashley, once upon a time, when she was in custody, once, and making sure she had some of what she needed, when she was homeless.  He’s a big reason she’s free now, instead of being an unofficial prisoner with a protective guard, like some of the people from the Birdcage and the S-class threats.”“Yeah.  You met for lunch?”Sveta smiled.  “It was a bit awkward, most of the time it was two or three of the four of us talking and the rest didn’t have anything to add.  But I’m glad we did it.  There was one moment where we were talking about something, I forget what led up to it, but for most of that lunch we were all very aware of the difference between us, and Weld said something about how people stared.  Ashley said she’d trade places with me or Weld, because she would like to be monstrous, because it would simplify things and it would make it more natural to be intimidating.  Nevermind that we’d really rather not be called monsters.”“Yeah.”“And Weld said something about that, and Mr. Armstrong tried to clarify, but it wasn’t getting through.  I remember thinking of just how huge the gulf was between us, and then I tried to explain things too.  I said how it was different from wearing a certain dress or acting a certain way, because you can’t take it off.  You can’t get away from it.  And that makes it something different.  Any situation you don’t have control over is automatically worse.”“What was her response?  You said it was a moment.”“It was really, really good.  She understood and then all of us were talking for the first time that lunch.  Weld, Ashley and I were all talking about very different things, pressure, differences, and the rest of the world feeling like something that presses in on us.  But we were on the same wavelength, with Mr. Armstrong chiming in now and again to clarify or add a point.  When the group started talking about wanting to make a team, I think that was one of the things that made it something I could be really interested in, instead of something where I had to say ‘yeah, that’s cool, but what about Ashley?’.”“I can picture that scene.  Was it what Armstrong wanted?”“I snuck a look at him, and he looked pleased as punch.  That was the last time we all got together.  I wonder if that moment was what he was going for, and he considers his work done now that it happened.”“It’s taken me a while to get that far with the group.  I’m not sure I’m all the way there.”“I’ve had to deal with it too, realizing it’s not all peaches and cream.”“Peaches and-  You mean peachy keen?”“Either,” Sveta said.She was giving me a cheeky look, probably because she knew I’d react.  I rolled my eyes.“Reality is a thing,” Sveta said.  “Stuff’s going on.”“The honeymoon period is over,” I said.“Yeah.  It wasn’t really a honeymoon.  More like it was nice when it was an idea, but once we executed it, we had to deal with stuff.”I nodded.I double checked my phone, which was still in my hand, then pocketed it.“Was there another moment?” I asked.“I went over to her apartment once, before a session.  Not long after the lunch thing.  It’s nice, she seems to save up to buy nicer things, but there are gaps.  So she has a really, really nice black leather couch, a black glass coffee table, a nice television, and a piece of art on the wall that looks expensive… and then for the rest of the room it’s moving boxes to sit on and put stuff on.”“I can sort of understand that.  I don’t think it’s unique to her.  When you first move out on your own, most of the time, I think you get other people’s leftover stuff, or thrift store stuff.  Everyone’s getting started over anew now.”“Yeah,” Sveta said.  She shrugged awkwardly, like it was a motion she hadn’t practiced much.  “But she loved all the things she had, so much.  There was something there.  I could see the person she might have been, without powers, or the kid she was before powers.  When I was defending her to you, in the first days we were with the group, that’s what I thought of.”“I like what she’s been doing for the group.  She’s been honest with me, but I don’t know if I’ve seen that glimmer of light.”Maybe I had.  When Ashley had seen Presley’s responses on the train.“I don’t know if I’d call it light.”“I don’t either.  But… I’m imagining what you’re saying.  I’ll keep it in mind.  I’ll keep an open mind.”“Please,” Sveta said.  “And we’re almost there.  The place might be a little messy, to warn you.”“Crystal and I are two people crammed into an apartment with room for one person, I don’t think it’s a problem,” I said.  I withheld the part where Crystal was a bit of a pig.The apartment building was one among many, in a building with a post office built into one corner of the ground floor.  With the small post office taking up a quarter of the ground floor, the remaining three quarters were divided into two spaces, it seemed.  The hallway was open-air, more tunnel than hall, and there were windows on both sides, looking into both the tunnel and a small, narrow yard.  I could see children’s toys in the yard.Sveta went to the door, and fished for a key on a lanyard that she wore around her neck.“Ground floor.  Convenient.”“Yeah.  Weld worries sometimes that if he was on an upstairs floor, if it was wooden floors, he’d cause too much wear and tear and then plunge through.”Sveta opened the door.  “I’m home.  I brought Victoria.”“Hey!”  Weld stepped into the kitchen.  He wore a black t-shirt in a tougher material, jeans, and the same rugged sandals I’d seen before.  A set of headphones were hanging from his neck.Sveta went straight to him, and he had to catch her so she wouldn’t crash into him.  She kissed him, then planted another kiss on his cheek when he turned his focus to me, smiling.“Victoria.  It’s so great to see you.”“Sorry to drop in, and I’m also sorry I’ll be distracted tonight.  I hope you don’t mind if I get my laptop out at some point.  We have stuff to coordinate and figure out.”“That’s fine.  I’d love to talk shop,” he said.  “Things have been weird with my team lately.  The gears of bureaucracy grind slowly.  Just one thing.”“One thing?”“Don’t say sorry.  I get enough of them from her.”“Don’t say that!” Sveta said, scandalized.“Three unnecessary apologies before breakfast, another two after breakfast, before she’s out the front door.  At least one in a text message.”“I’m not that bad.”Weld smiled, then planted a kiss on the side of her head.“Don’t try to mollify me or distract me.  Not while we have company,” Sveta said.  She pointed at me.  “She needs to unwind.  I thought we could do that and still hammer out the essentials.”“We’ll try,” Weld said.“Make yourself at home,” Sveta said.  “I’m going to go rinse off.  I’ve been cooped up in this body and I’m all waxy and gross inside here.  I’ll be back out in a minute.”“Do you want me to take your body?” Weld asked.“I’m okay.  I’ll bring a change of clothes in with me.”Sveta broke away from him and half-crashed-into, half-hugged me.  Clearly happy, she went off to do her thing, leaving Weld and I.“Make yourself comfortable.  I’d offer food and drink, but I’m not sure what we have.  I don’t usually partake-”Weld paused as Sveta closed the bathroom door.“-unless she’s inflicting an experiment on me.”“I heard that,” Sveta said, opening the door, before shutting it again.The apartment wasn’t what I would have called ‘messy’.  In a way, it was very different from Crystal’s place.  There was no detritus, nothing left lying around.Drawers had flat, painted metal faces, with no handles.  Furniture was divided into things with no legs with what looked like it might have been stone framing the edges, and Sveta’s favored grappling structures, which were poles extending from floor to ceiling with various platforms and things to hold on to.  Even the walls had metal bracing at the corners, painted over so Weld wouldn’t stick to them.“Case fifty-three living,” Weld said.“She said it was messy.  I don’t see it.”“Then I did a good job with my last-minute sweep and clean up,” Weld said.  “Living room?”I let him lead me to the living room.  I put my bag down by the coffee table and sat down on the couch, which looked homemade to withstand someone who weighed a few hundred pounds sitting on it.  It was so firm I nearly bounced off of it while sitting down.  Once I set my weight down, though, it gradually eased up, hissing as it adjusted to my weight.Leaning forward, I looked outside into the yard.  A toy plane was parked on the lawn, the kind a kid could sit in and push with their feet.“Did Sveta tell you what’s going on?” I asked.“Some.  I had trouble following who was who, sometimes, but I got the gist of it.”“There’s an attack planned on the Fallen tomorrow.  One of our… not sure how to put it, or how much you know.  Our contact, they’re at risk.  There are innocents there, and I’m not sure the villains care about sparing them.”“How can I help?” Weld asked.I adjusted my bag at my shoulder, to indicate, and said, “I’ve got a report partially written up.  If you could glance over it, let me know what you think?  You know the Wardens and what their mindset is.”“Sure.”“I wanted to do some stuff with my costume later, but that might have to wait.  It’d be nice to finalize some costume things when I get back to my place, but timing is getting tighter, since it’s already… seven thirty, and we have to get halfway across the city for ten thirty.”“My offer stands, you know,” Weld said.“Offer?”“To help with any of the metalwork, when you get a new costume.”It took me a second to connect the thought.“What the hell, Weld?  That was years ago, when I was thinking about rebranding and joining the Brockton Bay Wards.”“It stands,” Weld said, smiling.I paused.  “You’re sure?  I have stuff at my apartment.”“I’m sure.”“Thank you,” I said.  I fired off a quick series of texts to Crystal.Me:



Have you left yet?Best Cousin:



i’m on my way out the door. promiseMe:



If it’s not too heavy to carry, can you bring the black shopping bag with the yellow leaf on it from under that table?“Thank you,” I said, as I finished.“You’re worried about this,” Weld said.  “Sveta said you were tense.  It’s bad?”“It’s the Fallen, which aren’t great, and it’s a lot of villains who are pretty desperate for relevance.  We’ve got to pitch this to the Wardens, I think we need more hands on deck, and from the murmurings I’ve heard, there aren’t many to go around.”“There are some,” Weld said.  “Advance Guard is on standby, others are out of rotation.”“Advance Guard is… a thing,” I said.  “We ran into them earlier.  I’m not sure they’d cooperate unless made to.”“You might run into trouble getting anyone to cooperate.  If they aren’t occupied, they’re officially on standby.  Their instinct is going to be to be ready and available in case something bigger happens.”“Then I’d want to frame it in a way that would justify bringing these people out of standby?”“Yep.  Show me what you have?” he asked.I pulled out my laptop, setting it on the coffee table, which was three planks set atop six planks, set firmly in place with metal bands around the perimeter.  I wondered if it was built to be easily remade or rebuilt if it got broken.The planks had been painted in what I recognized as Sveta’s style.  Clear, bold outlines, almost like a paint-by-numbers picture, or a stained glass picture, but the colors that filled each space were rich, varied, and multi-textured.  Blue that became green, or shaded red, or mottled orange.Weld sat down next to me.  I opened the document and showed him.Three sub-factions in Cedar Point.  I’d outlined the people in brief, with them named in more detail at the appendix, pulling out old records, files, articles and more to depict them in as much detail as I could without getting too lost in the exact facts.  I’d put down their motivations, whether it was money or personal, I had notes on their adherence to the rules, real and unwritten, and I’d outlined other things about their behavior and patterns.“The problem with some of this is it doesn’t leave the immediate impression that this is something that multiple hero groups are going to want to step into,” Weld said.  “It’s deep knowledge that someone going into the fight would love, the geeks will love it, but it’s not something that’s going to get people into the fight, if they aren’t already convinced.”“Yeah.  It’s too dry.  I’m thinking the notes on petty crimes are distracting from the gravity of the situation.”“Yeah.”“Instead of an introduction to the parties involved, I could open with a presentation on the scenario, frontload it with words like war.”“Not war,” Weld said.  “That’s going to remind people that there’s something bigger on the horizon that we need to be ready for.”Bigger.  We had a group with a dozen capes and we had another forty or more capes from Cedar Point going on the offensive.“Of course.  Maybe… potential loss of civilian life, fallout, and provoking a retaliative back-and-forth that extends across the city at a time when resources are already tested.  Something that you don’t want happening behind you while you’re facing a war in front of you.”“Sounds like you have the right idea.”“Weld?” Sveta called out.“Be right back.”I worked on the document while Weld joined Sveta in the washroom.  Title page written, the size of confrontation outlined, and the ramifications made clear.I was writing it to try to convince a group of seasoned heroes and the people who managed them.  It felt convincing, because I was feeling nervous, getting into everything that was involved.The last time I’d been in something of this scale, I’d been spit on by a mutant the size of a truck.  I’d had most of my flesh melted off and necrotized, and I’d been left vulnerable and helpless.At that point in time, with the pain being as bad as it was, my emotions all over the map as I thought one thing and felt another, I’d been ready to die.  I hadn’t done nearly enough, but I’d fought and I was ready for it to be over.  The chance at living hadn’t been worth the risk of being healed.Tattletale had lied to me, and had forced Amy on me.  She had some small responsibility for everything that followed.So easy, in moments like this, for there to be a point of weakness.  Letting my guard down could do so much damage.I left the document like it was, so there was room for more revisions before polish.  I checked my messages.Eighteen total messages from Kenzie.  Photos of the body part of her costume in progress, some more stream-of-consciousness, she let me know when she was going to dinner, then when she came back.  Pizza, apparently.  She’d wanted to have her hands free to focus.  She also wanted to know what to bring.Which raised a question about what our exact role would be in things as they happened.  Our priorities.I put that aside.  It was for the group to discuss.Tristan.  Last I’d heard, he was talking to the lawyer.Tristan the Goat:



waiting for legal advisor nat now.



am not optimistic but got video footage from Ls as you recommended.



ugh.  if nat keeps me waiting any longer I’ll have to switch for byron.



going to svetas later btw. will update properly around then.I sent him a message to let him know I’d be at Sveta’s place.Tristan had been frustrated by Natalie earlier, but we’d try this, because I’d had a small amount of luck after giving her something more tangible to work with than my reports.  We’d try bouncing people off Natalie until we found one that worked.  If any one member of the group ended up being good at working with Natalie, we’d keep them in that role as legal liaison.  If Natalie couldn’t be worked with, we would find someone else.An email from Byron, twenty minutes after that.Byron the Blue:



rain left a voice message for me and Tristan.  sounded rushed.  he isn’t staying at his place tonight.  he might go back tomorrow but sounded weird.  specifically said he was messaging us to drop details so we would have lead if something happened to him.  ominous.More details to come.  Will send you the voice message when I get home to computer and figure out howConcerning. A message from Presley, sent via Email and translated to a text:Presley from the Train:



Can u ask ur friend from the train how she gets her hair so white?It put a slight smile on my face, when everything else felt so heavy.  I made a mental note to ask.There was also a group text discussion too long for me to search through, mostly Kenzie and Chris, where Chris was asking what forms we needed for him for tomorrow.  I scrolled down to the bottom, at which point Tristan was no longer participating.Creepy Kid:



Blind rage would be a mistake I think.  Sudden Shock is quick…



…Or Keen Vigilance.  Slow but tough…



…and I’d be able to see and hear most of what was going on.Heart Shaped Pupil:



Is that the one with all the eyes?Creepy Kid:



That’s Multifaceted Interest.  You call yourself a good student?Heart Shaped Pupil:



I am a good student.  Interest and vigilance are the same for you.Creepy Kid:



Same range of the spectrum as Vigilance but diff’t. Is open and loose…



…You haven’t seen Vigilance. Same thing but focused more and pulled together tight…



…Think armadillo with ears like a fennec fox and bigger eyes…



…and claws because its keenHeart Shaped Pupil:



AwwwCreepy Kid:



Very not aww. Ugh.I added my own thought to the text conversation.Victoria:



We want you on sidelines.  Fast would be good.  Rescue, evacuate civiliansHeart Shaped Pupil:



Vicotria!!!



Victoria!



How are you?  Excited?Creepy Kid:



I can make that one form.  But I want to get my hands dirty too.Hands dirty?  I paused, thinking about that.  Looking back at the conversation, I skimmed things.  Chris had contributed more than half of the conversation, going into detail, ideas, plans.I had never seen him quite this engaged.  Was it because he was more comfortable online than in person?  Or was it because he wanted to get his hands dirty, as he put it?Victoria:



Why?Creepy Kid:



_This_ is why I’m doing this hero team thing…



…I missed the visit to the Warden HQ because I wasn’t at the computer…



…which was my fault. I need to be a part of this.I didn’t reply immediately, instead sitting back, thinking about things, while Kenzie responded, sharing some of the same image she had already sent me as part of the chat.Chris wanted to be a part of this, and the visit to the Warden HQ.  He wanted to be part of the big things?  The large events?  But he didn’t care about the rest?  Were the big events tied to big emotions?I couldn’t understand him.A knock on the front door got my attention.  Weld stepped out of the bathroom, towel at one of his hands, and let Crystal in.  She had the binder and the bag.  She was wearing her bodysuit with a jacket and jeans.  The ‘Laserdream’ logo on the front, an arrow with a series of lines flowing behind it at a diagonal.“This is so damn heavy, Victoria” she said.“If it was too heavy you should have left it,” I said.  I hurried across the living room and down the hallway to reach her, relieving her of the bag.Greetings went around.  Sveta stepped out of the washroom, wearing her body again, with a sweatshirt and sweatpants on.  Her makeup had been washed off, and the tattoo was clearly visible on her cheekbone.  She gave Crystal a hug.“They’re preparing for a crisis,” Weld said.“I know,” Crystal said.  “Believe me, I know.”We moved to the living room.  I set the black cloth shopping bag down, and fished inside.“What’s in this bag?” Crystal asked.I pulled out some of the costume materials.There were four ways to go with a costume.  The first was to make it yourself.  It leaned heavily on one’s own ability, and I wasn’t sure I had the ability to keep everything trim while also giving it a unique cut.  The second way was to buy it, but that had problems, and a lot of the places and people that offered costume making services had a way of injecting their own tastes into things, so one of their clients often resembled another.  The third way was to have someone else handle that for you, working for the like of the Wards or Wardens and leaving it up to the Branding department.  Not an option for me.The fourth was to mix and match.  I’d take a small shortcut.  I’d bought black and white versions of the same hooded top, picked for the slanted cut around the collar, shoulders, and the more sleeves.  I could cut one up and use it to apply trim to the other and know the cut would match.  Then I’d apply the additional elements that would make it a costume.“I was going to do some sewing to keep my hands busy while I read up on things, but plans changed.”“Cloth isn’t that heavy.  What else is that, that makes it so heavy?” Crystal asked.“Spare stuff from dad,” I said.  I pulled out some equipment.  It was the right kind of material, all in a matte gunmetal, but the texture was all wrong.  Dad was ‘Flashbang’ and the armor panels, mask, straps, and guards were all in the style of a grooved grenade exterior.  I’d always thought it was a dumb theme when most flashbangs were smooth-exterior canisters.  “I was thinking I could maybe get you to trim it, Crystal.  Sear off the knobby bits and leave just the panel of armor.  I haven’t quite worked the process out.”“I can do that.  What look do you want?” Weld asked.I grabbed the binder, and began flipping through it.  Costume notes and ideas.“There are years of geeking out in that binder, for the record,” Crystal said.Sveta collapsed into the seat next to me, looking at the art I’d picked out for reference and ideas.I found pages, opened the binder to retrieve them, and then closed it so I could fish for more.“Hood, layered long sleeves I can remove as needed for weather.  Fingerless gloves with decoration.  Metal decoration at the front and edges of the hood… like this image here.  Spikes, like my old tiara, but at the shoulder, decorating edges of the hood, and at the breastplate… which would be structured on a basic level, just like this image.”The breastplate was flat, with only a slight curve to deflect blows.  A matching, briefer plate rested against the collarbone and upper breast, the bottom part overlapping and sticking up slightly.“A bit of a warrior angel,” Weld said, turning one picture around so it was right-side-up for him.“Without the wings.  Yeah, maybe,” I said.“Sweetie, no,” Crystal said.  “You’re one of the very few capes who can get away with a breastplate that shows off the assets, because you have the forcefield.  You don’t want to be pervy about it, because that’s a whole different kind of cape, but a costume should make more of what you are.”I rolled my eyes at her.“It would be utterly criminal if I let you do that,” she said.I shook my head.  “If any kids end up looking up to me, or if any became heroes, I don’t want them thinking that kind of armor is okay.  It’s asking to get hurt.”“It’s still way better than a bodysuit, and we’ve been wearing those for years,” Crystal said.“I like the idea of armor.  I intend to get up close and personal, and my defenses won’t always be up.”“I know that,” Crystal said.  “I can see it.  But you shouldn’t hide in your costume.  It shouldn’t bury you.  I said the same to- I’ve said it often enough before.”She’d said the same to Amy.I hadn’t missed the fact that Amy had worn a hood as part of her costume.Maybe I’d go with black cloth, applying the white trim, rather than the inverse.“I think Victoria should dress the way she wants,” Sveta said.“So do I,” Crystal said.  “But I also think sometimes friends and family need to steer you a bit.”“I don’t see it as hiding,” I said.  “That’s not the reasoning or logic.  I want the costume to have weight, while still being form-fitting at the torso and arms.  Layers, armor, the hood.  Breaking from the norm is important, because it makes an impact.  Most of the time, you see a cape in a hood, and you naturally glance beneath, and there’s a gimmick keeping the face beneath from being seen.  Another mask, or power-generated shadow, or something else.  They’ll just see me.  Glaring or smiling, but it could have more impact when they do.”“No mask?” Crystal asked.“I thought about it.  I might have one for protective reasons, for intense situations or cold weather, but… it’s not me.”“Okay,” she said.“Spikes,” Weld said.  “You want me to do those?  And the breastplate?”“I don’t have a breastplate,” I said.  “Just the extra pads.”“I can blend them into each other.  The shiny coating will be pretty thin, though.  I have stuff of my own.”“Please,” I said.  “That’d be amazing.”Sveta bumped her shoulder into mine.  “See?  Seee?  It was so good you came.”“You sound more like Kenzie than yourself right now.”“This is good.  People!  We collaborate.”“I need more information on the spikes before I do the rough shape,” Weld said.  “You made notes on this.  Five spikes at the shoulder, uneven?”“Rays more than spikes,” I said.  “They space out, four, and then one shorter.  Minor gap between the four and one.”“Any reason for the short one?” Weld asked.“Symmetry,” I said.  “It curves in, so it’s more toward the front of the shoulder, and it leads into more of the same at the breastplate decoration.”“Hmmm.”“No?” I asked.“Hhm.  I’ll trust your instincts,” he said.  “I can work faster if I heat the metal up.  I’m going to go set up the forge.”“Why barbecue when you can use lasers?” Crystal asked.  “Lasers are great.  We can collab and gossip like schoolgirls while these two work out their business.”“My schoolgirl impression leaves a lot to be desired,” Weld said.Crystal grinned.  “But barbecue sounds good, while we’re on the subject.  I was tempted here with food and promises of a chance to tease my cousin.”“Ah, right.  I tend to forget, because I don’t eat much,” Weld said.“Wait, wait, wait.  Promises of what?” I asked.“Implied promises, at least,” she said.“I can order in,” Sveta said.  “We can do the teasing later.”“You guys laugh, but I can fire back just as hard.”“I look forward to it,” Crystal said.They headed over to the door that led out into the backyard and the brick patio, collecting a few of the components, and paused at the door.A kid, about five or six, was at the glass door.  His mouth was pressed to the glass and he was exhaling, so his cheeks puffed out and the inside of his mouth was in plain view.“He’s one of the kids from next door,” Sveta said.  “We don’t use the backyard much, since Weld tears it up and I have a harder time walking on grass.  Sometimes they say hi.”“Open sesame!” Weld called out.The kid hurried to obey.  He milled around Weld and Crystal as they got themselves organized outside.  Crystal set up a forcefield to keep the kid at bay while starting to heat up the metal.  The kid seemed fascinated by the field.Sveta and I remained on the couch, watching Weld, Crystal, and the kid through the glass.“It’s nice, having the kids around,” Sveta said.  “Annoying sometimes, but mostly nice.”“Yeah.  Do you do much with them?”“We babysit.  I have art in my room that I got from them.  I gave them some back.  I think it’s important.  Reaching out, having that human connection, having people have good experiences with us.”“Absolutely,” I said.“Five spikes, one shorter and set apart.  Is it a hand?” Sveta asked.  Her voice was quiet.  For me alone.  “A dangerous hand?”“Yeah, a bit,” I said.  “A bit of the sun, glory, crown of the statue of liberty motif.  But the hands are- yeah.”“Why?”“Because sooner or later, people are going to find out about the w- about my forcefield.  It might be a certain power interaction, it might be dust in the air or rain streaming down it.  Maybe a person looks through a tinker lens and sees it.  I’ll make my uneasy peace with it first.  I want to own that side of myself, at least a little, before that happens.”“What were you about to call it, before you stopped yourself?”I hesitated.  “The wretch.”“Is it?  A wretch?  It’s strong, isn’t it?  I was thinking about it, and how you carried Kenzie’s box.  You used straps.”“More about where it comes from than what it is,” I said.“Mine is anxiety and instinct,” Sveta said.  “If you ever want, I can tell you some things that Mrs. Yamada taught me.  But try to figure out what it’s doing first, then figure out how to work around it.”“Thanks,” I said.  Looking for a bit of an escape or out, I reached out for the binder, and shifted its position on the table.“Owning it sounds like a good start.  That’s the last I’ll say until you ask.  Now, tell me, do you have anything in here to help inspire my costume?”“I have so much in here for your costume,” I said, smiling at least in part due to my relief that that conversation was over.⊙Sveta and Weld’s place had been tidy before, but it was something else by the time the next knock on the door came.  Costume pieces, straps, cut cloth, paper bowls of clearly recycled paper with inauthentic Chinese food within, metal, costume notes, and two laptops.Weld had put his music on.  He had an eclectic taste, and the current song was, as close as I could place it, rock with one of the two vocalists using throat singing.Tristan entered, carrying his bag over one shoulder.  Natalie followed him in.“Who’s this?” Crystal asked me.“Natalie, the paralegal, and Tristan, the teammate.”“I like Tristan’s choice in colors,” Crystal said.I didn’t get a chance to respond, because Tristan and Natalie joined us in the living room.“Crystal.  We didn’t meet,” Tristan said.  “I was watching on camera while you visited Cedar Point.”“I love the hair,” Crystal said.  “I like the color, too.  I have a soft spot for boys who are brave enough to dye their hair.  If only you were a bit older.”“I’m flattered,” Tristan said.  “Those aren’t the boys I tend to go after, myself, but my dating life isn’t very… alive, either.”“Ah, is that so?” Crystal asked.  “Here, come sit.  I think there’s a clear space somewhere here.”“Costume stuff, apparently.  And we’ve got the munchkins on the screen,” Tristan observed.  He bent down and waved for the camera that was built into the corner of the laptop.  A tiny Kenzie waved back.  Chris existed only in text.“And this is Natalie,” I introduced Natalie.  I wasn’t wholly sure why she was here, but Tristan had wanted to invite her, and I wasn’t about to object if he was trying another way to get her more onboard.  “Mom recommended her.  Natalie, this is Crystal, my cousin.”“Pleasure,” Crystal said, half-standing to extend a hand.Natalie shook it and gave Crystal a tight smile back.  Crystal gave me a momentary glance as she sat back down.“I’m sorry we’re such a mess right now,” Sveta said.  “The apartment is usually nicer.”“I totally understand,” Natalie said.  “Don’t worry.”“Food,” Weld said.  “Help yourself, please.  Sveta doesn’t eat much and it’ll go to waste otherwise.  I think we kept track of the ones I ate from and put them away.”“Why does it matter?” Tristan asked.“I don’t have much sense of smell or taste.  We’ve been exploring, and we’re getting further afield, trying things that are not so good for flesh and blood.”“We started with capsaicin and citric acid concentrate,” Sveta said.“Among other things,” Weld said.“We’ll find something,” Sveta said.“Hoping so.  If it tastes funny, don’t keep eating it,” Weld said.  “I think we removed all of the dishes I tried.”“I’ll pass, thank you,” Natalie said.Tristan sat down on the floor next to Crystal, grabbing a spare bowl, before portioning out contents.“Any more word from our absentee?” I asked.“Nothing except a string of seemingly random words left in case he disappears for good.  It’s cryptic enough it would take some trying to find him, which I think is what he intends.”“It might be a good thing,” Crystal said.  “If they’re after him.”“Tactically?  Yes.  But he’s a friend.  He told me almost everything,” Tristan said.  “Not this.”I looked at the screen of the computer.  Rapping my fingers against the edge of the laptop twice, I said, “C says it’s unusual for our missing member to use something that cryptic.  He’s not wrong.”“There’s a lot of unusual happening with him lately, I don’t know what conclusions to draw from that,” Tristan said.  “He gives himself a hard time because he doesn’t realize that he has a lot of inner strength and a lot of general talents the rest of us don’t have.  I think he’s capable enough to come out of this intact, barring the worst case scenarios.”“I worry about the people around him, too,” I said.“I do too,” Sveta said.  She held out her arm while Weld checked the fit of a different arm encasement.  His finger drawn to a point, he raked it along the metal to mark a part that needed fixing.“We’ll figure this out,” Tristan said.“How did the talk go?” I asked, looking between Tristan and Natalie.“Natalie and I covered the events of the day,” Tristan said.  “Byron is loaning me time so I can do more.  He’ll help some tomorrow too.  He’s not up for the hero thing, but this is serious enough that he’s on board.  We’re a little more divided on tomorrow.”“Thank you, Byron,” I said.  “As for tomorrow, Natalie, maybe you could take a look at the proposal for the Wardens?”I turned my laptop around for her.  She took a seat on the ground to read it, no longer standing and hovering around like she didn’t know what to do with herself.On the screen of Sveta’s laptop, Kenzie was elbow-deep in electronics, unable to type.  No recent messages from Chris.Just about everyone had their costumes ready.  Kenzie was going to equip Chris with some projectors.“Two major groups of capes,” I said.  “The Fallen aren’t to be messed with.  They were a minor nuisance for years, with some bad stuff going on in the background, with kidnappings, murders, mutilations of minorities, case fifty-threes included, and a lot of low-level terrorist or attention-grabbing stunts.  The group we’re focusing on now, I believe, are the Mathers.  Each of the major branches took an Endbringer as a theme, and the Mathers took the Simurgh.”“The kidnappings were their thing,” Weld said.  “Back in Bet, they would go after isolated capes, ages sixteen to twenty-five.  These capes would be married into the family.  Thirteen incidents over seven years.  Three of the kidnapping victims stayed.  Three died.  The rest escaped, were released, or were freed by PRT intervention.  The PRT tried to go after them, but they moved frequently and they had anti-thinker measures in place.”“It stands to reason they still have them,” I said.  Because Rain had been hiding among them.“Stands to reason,” Tristan said.  “Looksee, that means you keep cameras off of the Fallen, unless we give the all clear.  We don’t know if it goes through cameras, and your cameras are weird enough it might be more dangerous.”Kenzie took her hands off of her work to type.  Protests, it seemed.“We’ll present our situation to the Wardens and we’ll do what we can to get them on board.  Whether we get them or not, we’ll have some priorities, small scale and big,  and they’ll be what we default to if we’re caught in the moment.”“May I?” Tristan asked, scooting over and shifting the laptop so it was at a middle ground where both he and Natalie could read it.  Natalie gave him an annoyed look.  “You wrote them down.  Good.”I leaned forward.  “This attack on the Fallen?  It’s villains looking for validation and a chance to show their stuff, and a lot of natural and justified hate for the Fallen.  They’re an acceptable target, and the Hollow Point group wants to show they’re a force unto themselves.  Part of the group will be going after our teammate, unfortunately, and we can’t control that directly.  But he’s not the focus of the larger group.”“We’ll trust him, that he knows what he’s doing, if he’s hiding,” Tristan said.“We have to, your buddy Chris says,” Crystal said.“I was gracefully avoiding mentioning that, Chris,” Tristan said.I went on, “Depending on how the scenario unfolds, we may need to evacuate bystanders.  The Hollow Point group is attacking the compound.  They arrived in cars, they had low-tier members out gassing up the cars for a trip, so we can assume they’ll drive and they’ll arrive at the compound, taking action from there.  They’ll probably split up, with teams that know each other sticking together.”“Factions within the group,” Sveta said.  “Already some infighting.”“Yep.    I emailed people my last draft of the document.  It covers the groups to expect.  Read it tonight or early tomorrow.  In a big engagement, we can’t just throw ourselves into the skirmish and hope things will resolve themselves,” I said.  “Tristan is more comfortable managing the group in the heat of the fight, I think.  I can give a bird’s eye view, and I’ll communicate what I can.  If I can’t solve an emerging problem myself, I’ll try to give direction to those who can.”“Are the younger members of the group participating?” Natalie asked.“Not directly,” I said.  “We talked about it.  We’ll do the same as we did in Cedar Point yesterday.  Looksee as toolbox, if she participates it’ll be as a projection, and we’ll keep her removed from the Fallen.  She focuses more on the Hollow Point group.  C runs interference.”“Text from Looksee,” Crystal reported.  “She says her mom can drop her off with her projector.  That’s an adorable image, a cape being dropped off by a parent.”“Not so adorable,” Tristan said.“She wants to know if you can carry her projector in.”“You’re the one carrying it,” Tristan said, to me.“Not in,” I said.  “We’ll bring it and keep it near our retreat, so we have a point to fall back to.”“Alright.  What does Looksee think?”“She says that’s fine,” Crystal said.“The focus in big engagements is to identify the points we can change, and act on them,” I said.  “Rescue and civilians will be a continuous one.”Natalie moved the laptop, turning it toward Tristan.“You’re done?” I asked.“I read it.  I didn’t get into the list of capes, but I read about the ones in charge.”“And?”“I think the justifications for getting involved are sound.  That depends on what the Wardens say, mind you.  If they don’t agree, I don’t agree either.  It does seem to me, however, that it seems like the kind of thing where heroes are very badly needed.  I hope you get their help.”“Thank you,” I said.“I don’t think the younger members of the group should be involved.”“Looksee will be more or less remote,” Tristan said.  “Creepy kid will be venturing in only when we give the a-ok.”“As… Sudden Shock and Deep Reflection?”“I guess,” Tristan said.“If the Youth Guard were active, they’d say no,” Natalie said.“Can you mute the laptop so they don’t hear?” Tristan asked.Crystal covered the microphone on the laptop with her hand.“Natalie,” Tristan said.  “If they Youth Guard were active, they’d say no, and the kids would get involved anyway.  That was a thing that happened in my experience.”“Oh man, my brother and I gave everyone headaches,” Crystal said.  “Our grades dropped and our parents were told we had to give up the costumes for a few months until we pulled them back up.  Our parents, the Youth Guard, even the PRT was asked to keep an eye out for us.  We were scoundrels.”“Right?” Tristan asked.Crystal took her hand away from the microphone.  Both Chris and Kenzie were protesting at length about being deafened for that segment of conversation, with lines of chat appearing so fast they were hard to read.  Kenzie seemed to mostly enjoy joining her voice to Chris’.“I’ve given my advice.”“They’re members of the team,” Sveta said.  “We’ll keep them safe.”Natalie pursed her lips but didn’t say anything.“Let’s talk about major objectives,” I said.  “On the small scale, we help the civilians.  Pulling away from that, there are a few worst case scenarios here.”⊙“Major objectives,” I said.  “Containment, control, resolution.”It was late, and the light from the windows were dark.  The administration in charge of the Wardens were sitting at the tables in front of us, to our left, and to our right.  Chevalier and Valkyrie were present, sitting directly in front of me.  Legend’s seat was empty.  I saw the name plate for Chief Armstrong, white haired with a very pronounced chin and a crooked nose.  He looked more like a mad scientist or a quirky grandfather than a major figure in the cape scene.Some of them had laptops or tablets.  Chevalier was one of them.  He’d taken off his gold and silver helmet and wore a cloth mask beneath.  Not his serious armor set.  Valkyrie was in full costume, helmet on, and had no technology.  She did have a a specter standing just behind her right shoulder.  A man with a hazy silhouette.I wore my costume.  The white decorative  trim on the black fabric was missing, and I planned more ornamentation for my gloves, but the rest was intact.  Spires of gold like my old tiara stood up at my shoulders, the middle-center of my breastplate, and decorated the armor around my legs and on my gloves.  The decoration at my forehead was a weight that kept my hood down, and my hair draped out over my right shoulder.  A protective mask hung from my belt, the curved surface resting around the curve of my thigh.  I’d don it if there was danger, and if I didn’t need to speak.The costume had a weight to it.  It felt almost right.“Talk to me about containment,” Chevalier said.“The worst case scenarios here are that this becomes a problem for the city,” I said.  “If the Fallen lose but aren’t wiped out, precedent suggests they’ll hit back harder.  We could expect guerilla tactics throughout the city, terror attacks, and a hit against Cedar Point in particular.”“The area that has been colloquially named Hollow Point,” a woman said.“Yes, ma’am,” Capricorn answered.“We’ll be operating from the perimeter, because getting into the thick of the situation would be beyond our abilities.  Part of our aim will be to keep Fallen from splintering away to regroup and lash out.  We’ll have a tinker trap waiting on the main road out of the area, and we’ll have eyes on the logging roads.”“Does this perimeter extend to containing the villains of Hollow Point?” a man in a suit asked.  “If they rush in… does this tinker trap trap them there?”I looked to my left, where Capricorn stood in his armor, then to my right, where Sveta was.  She’d donned some decorative additions.  As I wore spikes that echoed the wretch’s hands, Sveta wore armor that curved and curled away.Kenzie was workshopping and had an earlier bedtime.  Chris had wanted to come, but we hadn’t been able to get him in costume, and having him around and uncostumed wasn’t a good look when we wanted to present our best face.He’d been a little upset.“We debated that,” Capricorn ventured.  “Our instinct is that Cedar Point’s villains would get desperate, if they were trapped on hostile territory.  That would risk civilian well being.  The trap is a soft deterrent more than anything else.  We think we’d let them go rather than try to force it, but we decided we’d leave it up to you, should the Wardens decide to get involved.”“Then we will get back to you with our thoughts, should we decide to get involved,” the man said.  Tristan ducked his head in acknowledgement.“Control,” Chevalier said.“The document we sent you outlines a few priority targets to watch out for.  In the old days, their wiki pages would have had warnings.  Our focus is more on Cedar Point than on the Fallen, because we have an incomplete picture of the latter.  These people are more likely to hurt civilians, and they’re likely to escalate the situation.  If we can target them and remove them from the picture, we will.  We have a contact keeping an eye on them already.”“We could supply what we have on this group of the Fallen,” Chevalier said.  “Whether or not we get involved, I think we lose very little by rounding out your knowledge there.”He checked with others, and got nods of affirmation.I felt my heart skip a beat.  Whether they agreed or not, they weren’t saying no.  They weren’t telling us to go away and mind our own business.“Thank you,” I said, once I found the words.Capricorn spoke up, “Our goal with control is to keep an eye out for anything that would make the situation that much worse.  If we take out or hamper these problem elements, the situation is free to wind down.  If we don’t, there’s a risk it perpetuates, and that’s something we want to avoid.”“Resolution, then,” Chevalier said.I was so glad I’d outlined things as Weld suggested, with clear objectives and scenario outlined in the first few pages.  Chevalier was really using them as guideposts, picking up whenever nobody else was talking, keeping the meeting running smoothly.“What resolution do you want?”“We want a resolution,” I said.  “If this ends and the Fallen aren’t wiped out, they’ll hit back.  The city suffers.  If it ends and they are wiped out, Cedar Point is going to become something more pronounced.  We’ll want to be mindful of who is in play, and who might take charge of that.”“As things come closer to a conclusion, we may take a role,” Capricorn said.  “If we’re strong enough, and if we have the resources, we could clean up those who are left.”“That’s a stretch,” Sveta said.  She hadn’t said much, but I had the impression she was intimidated by the room.  “We focus on civilians first.  We’d need a lot of firepower before we can think about handling that kind of clean-up.”“We’re not in a position to give you a lot of firepower,” Chevalier said, emphasizing ‘lot’.  “Valkyrie cannot engage that group of Fallen, and I’m tied up elsewhere with diplomatic roles.  Many other Wardens and subordinate teams are busy.  Advance Guard is on standby.  We’ll ask them to assist you.”I don’t want them, I thought.“We have junior Wardens, as well.  They’ll assist.  We’ll let them know tonight and they’ll be at your disposal tomorrow.”Them, I wanted.  It meant Weld.  It meant potential others, who I knew and very much respected.“Thank you,” Tristan said, my voice and Sveta’s only a bit behind his.“You’re right about this.  We knew something was stirring, but we didn’t have the impression it was this bad.  I’ve been keeping updated on the Fallen, I can’t promise it’s accurate, but you should know the families interact.  There may be one or more of the Crowley sub-branches present.  They also associate with various biker gangs, the various racist factions, and other religious villain groups and ideologues.  Be prepared for any of them.”“Yes sir,” Tristan said.“In case of emergency, if you find you’re in over your head, leave.  Retreat, wash your hands of it.  Your lives come first.”Sveta and I nodded, as Tristan said, “Yes sir,” again.“I think those are my thoughts,” Chevalier said.  “Any further comments?  Anyone?”Some heads shook.  Others were silent.He fixed his eyes on us.  “Any final thoughts, concerns?  Anything not in this document we should know, or anything you’ve learned since writing it?”There were a few somethings in the document we hadn’t mentioned or outlined in full.We’d mentioned Rain, though not by name, as only a contact in the Fallen, who might or might not have been compromised.  I’d detailed how we had someone, Ashley, acting on our behalf in Cedar Point, and how we might have Rain in the Fallen camp when we took action.  It would give us more control over the situation, if we had that information and those levers to pull.We could have said more about Rain, and we hadn’t.  Rescuing him was a mission statement.We hadn’t said one word about the therapy group, or our individual issues and crises.Much as I’d wondered if I should mention my time in the hospital during job interviews or when applying to teams, I’d been left the question of it here, standing before the committee.I could be honest, say something, and they almost certainly wouldn’t let us do this.  I could have mentioned my background when applying to teams, and I would have had even worse luck joining them.Or I could stay silent.“No,” Sveta said.  Her voice was soft in what someone else might have mistaken for timidity.  I knew she was nervous, but I didn’t think it was timidity.  She was thinking the same thing I was.“No sir,” Tristan said, with confidence.“No,” I said, adding my lie to theirs.                                                                                        Shadow – 5.8                                                                                        The gunfire continued.  I flew back to the others, positioning myself a good twenty feet from them.  My power was active, serving to shield them.“Get behind cover,” I said.I was glad to see them listen.  Not only did they get to safety, but they weren’t in a position to see if the wretch reached out to any nearby vegetation.The rules of ‘the game’ were that guns were verboten.  ‘The game’.  Gangs liked the terminology, and I was pretty sure it had stemmed from that culture.  It was the nature of social groups to self-moderate.  Things that were selfish and advantageous but that went against the group’s greater interests were acted on.  Capes leaned pretty heavily on that abstract moderating force, because the laws had never kept up with us and we’d had to moderate ourselves.That was the game.  It was the walking of the line between the selfish things we did for ourselves and our teams and what served the greater good.  Secret identities were to be left alone.  Families weren’t to be touched.  The day to day of the city and civilian lives weren’t allowed to be disrupted.  No killing; no guns.Capes used swords, crossbows, they used bows and other weapons that were just as lethal as a gun, given a chance.  Most of the time it was to coordinate with another power.  Capes threw explosive chunks of their bodies, among other things.  My home town had had Miss Militia in a role as lieutenant of the Protectorate and then as leader of the team, and she had guns as part of her power.It came down to symbols, to what the gun meant, and whether the person with the gun was playing along.  With a sword or bow, the assumption was yes.  When a gun was drawn or fired, barring any context, the assumption was –had to be, even- no.  Carrying a gun as a cape and using it implied things that other weapons didn’t.Tattletale had aimed a handgun at me once, and she had pulled the trigger.  In that, at least, she had been playing along.  It had been a tool, not a weapon.  I had some grievances when it came to her, but that wasn’t one of them.The Fallen and the villains of Hollow Point?  They weren’t playing any games.  Powers were used, and a tight cluster of three or four explosions in quick succession were followed by creaking, snapping sounds that might have been trees or a building collapsing.I heard the sound of wood splintering near me, and I turned my head in time to see the side of a tree crunch inward, as if two axes had bit into it.  Bit.  The wretch was taking a bite out of the wood.There were other signs of the wretch’s restlessness nearby.  Bark was scraped from trees by hands.I dropped my forcefield and stepped around a tree until it stood between me and the ongoing gunfire.  My back to the tree’s trunk, facing the others, I asked, “You guys okay?”“I don’t think they’re firing in this direction,” Capricorn said.“Can you provide some cover?” I asked.  “I don’t think anyone’s close.”“Yeah.”The orange motes began to dance between trees.“We move toward the road,” I said.  “We’ll cross it, and then we cut toward the settlement.”“Victoria, you take point.  Sveta, put yourself between her and us.  Kids, with me.  Looksee, watch what your camera is looking at.  I don’t want you getting hit by the anti-thinker measures.”“Uh huh.  Tattletale went into a building with some henchmen.  She waved at the camera and smiled, which was kind of nice, if you look at it a certain way.  Foil, Parian, Hellhound and Imp are leaving and going up your way.  If you guys decided you had to run with the guns, you could come back and come after her.  That could be good.”“Brevity,” Chris said.  “This is a situation, Looksee, use fewer words.”“Okay,” she said.“Let’s stick to the plan,” Capricorn said.  He gave me a sidelong look as he said it, and I nodded in response to the unspoken question.He moved his hand, and walls snapped into existence where the orange motes had been.  Their height was such that if I stood straight, I could look over the parts where the spikes didn’t stick up.  So long as I crouched, I was clear.  I flew low to the ground, the walls to my left, in the direction of the road.I could hear something that might have been a motorcycle or dirt bike.  Others started up.  Gunfire answered the revving.At the end of the wall, I crouched lower to the ground.  Flight let me move silently.The revving got louder, until I could feel it in my chest.  I could hear the sound of wheels kicking stuff up, the snapping of branches, and in my efforts to tell where the bike was on the road, I was totally lost.  It sounded like it was coming right toward me.As the bike drew nearer, the sounds became clear.  The tearing sound of the wheels wasn’t from wheels on a dirt road, but underbrush.  I canceled my forcefield and drew my arms closer to my chest, so they wouldn’t be out to the side.The bike flew past me.  It was a road bike, with metal teeth on the wheels, probably for situations just like this one.  One hand on a submachine gun, an Uzi, the other on the handlebars, he zig-zagged heavily, riding it through dense forest, throwing his bike to one side or the other with all of his body weight.  Each turn seemed like it might be his last.His rear wheel skidded along a growth of roots that was as broad as some trees, he popped a wheelie, and when the wheel came down, he came to a stop, now facing more in my direction.  Young-ish.  Maybe thirty.  His hair was long and he had a longer beard, black and narrow at the chin, a metal thing just below his lip.  With the cut of his mustache, the points at his eyebrows, and his sunglasses all resembling the shape of the wings of the bats on his leather jacket, I was getting a sense of his theme.I wasn’t sure if he’d seen me.  I remained still.  I realized a moment later that, given the theme, that might be a dumb thing to do.His head bent down, facing the ground, and he was panting for breath.  He passed his gun to his right hand.The wind blew past us.  Dust from his trip across the forest floor was riled up further, instead of settling down.His head turned my way.I took off, not flying directly at him, but to a point off to his side.  Forcefield up, I kept trees between us for good measure.He shot a burst, and it sounded more like one sound than a series of distinct ones.  I could feel the forcefield collapse like a bubble popping.  The collapse was almost instantaneous, but not entirely.  The bullet had touched a point somewhere behind my feet, and once the forcefield gave, the breaking of the field cascaded from there in the blink of an eye.My hand went out, and I grabbed a tree to help stop myself as I ceased flying.  Tree between us, I flew straight up, arms around my head to shield myself from intervening branches.Covered by the thickest of the trees, I circled around him.The engine revved, wheels digging for traction.He rode off in the direction of the dirt road, and I went after him, staying at the level where the peaks and upper reaches of the trees provided some cover, but were far enough from one another that I could easily fly through the gaps and keep one eye on the biker.He rode away from me like he knew where I was.  Even though he was riding recklessly, he still needed to zig-zag, and I wasn’t sure he would have been any faster than me on a clear path.  I could get ahead of him, above him.He fired.  I could hear the submachine gun fire one burst, then another.    I could hear the bullets cutting through the air, but they didn’t touch the wretch or me.I dove, wretch active, and when I cut through the leaves and found a large branch in my way, I let the wretch collide with it.  He’d made enough noise with that gun, and I could make some by breaking the branch clean off the tree.The bike roared as he kicked it into life, using it to get himself clear of the falling wood.  Couldn’t get a bead on me, so he was running.I was already moving, though.  The moment I knew where he was going, I moved to intercept.  In his haste to get going and find his balance, he’d laid the uzi against one of the handlebars.  He wasn’t in a position to aim it at me.I caught the weapon and the hand that gripped it.  He tried to adjust, another wheelie with a spin as everything rested on the back wheel as a kind of forced stop or attempt to bring the bike around to collide with me.  I hauled him back and away from the bike before he could finish the motion.  He tumbled into moss, stones, and weeds, emtpy-handed.Wretch out, uzi held firmly in my hand, I flew at the bike as it tumbled to the ground.  I swung my hand, backhanded, and the wretch followed suit, demolishing it.Bat-biker didn’t get up or do much except lie on his side, panting hard.  The fall hadn’t been hard enough to incapacitate him.A fear response?  I didn’t even have my aura out.I approached him and set one foot on his wrist, so it would be easier to keep an eye on the other.  “I’m betting someone like you has other weapons.  Tell me where, and don’t touch them unless you want me to treat you like I treated your bike.”He went very still.I pushed out with my aura, keeping it small.  I didn’t want to tip anyone else off about my presence.“Weapons.  Now,” I said.When I moved my hand, still holding the uzi, he responded by moving his free arm, hiking up his jacket.  I could see the handgun there.  A beefy, overcompensation sort of gun, which didn’t really suit his average frame.It seemed he respected the gun more than the person with powers.  Stupid.I collected the handgun.  Kicking with one foot, I pushed one of his pant legs up, then the other.Knife at the ankle.  I kept the gun trained on him, released his wrist, and retrieved the knife.  He didn’t resist as I stepped on his wrist once again.  My hands were pretty full at this point.“What else?” I asked.“That’s it.”Prodding with my toe, using flight to avoid putting too much weight on his wrist, I investigated his jacket.  Something rattled.“What’s here?”“Cigarettes.”“Remove them.  Throw them aside.  Slowly.”He did.  It was a large carton of cigarettes, but as it landed, there were needles with caps on inside, sitting at an angle.I raised an eyebrow.“Medical, really,” he said.  “Helps with the headaches from my power.”“Don’t leave stuff out,” I said, amping up my aura some more.  I poked more with my toe, and found another weight at the vest pocket of his jacket.“Phone,” he volunteered.I kicked down, catching the phone between my heel and a rock.  I heard something break.  I did it again.  I saw his expression change, a snarl.I flew up and away from him, until I could see the surroundings.  I spotted a hole in a tree, and put the weapons within.He was on his feet by the time I got back to him.  He backed away a step, then fell on his ass.“Bikers.  You’re on the Fallen’s side in this?”He twisted up his face into a scowl so fierce that it looked like a pretty sure thing he wouldn’t open his mouth.“I’ll take that as a yes,” I said.I flew at him.  He swung a punch my way, and I put my forcefield up.  His arm was too far out to the side, and he didn’t even hit me hard enough to drop my defenses.I moved right into his personal space, and the sour sweat smell of him made me wish I hadn’t.  Seizing his belt buckle in one hand and his belt in the other, I flew.He was heavy, as I dismissed my defenses.  His arms were free and he could have swung a punch, but it would have done more harm to him than to me.  Instead, faced with my aura and a very swift ascent, he grabbed onto the top edge of my breastplate for leverage.We reached the treetops, where the branches were thinner.  I roughly deposited him on something that looked reasonably sturdy and unreasonably high up.  The impact of my setting him down helped to break his grip on me.I could hear the gunfire continuing.  It had moved.  By the sound of it, Hollow Point’s group was venturing along one edge of the camp, moving counter-clockwise along the perimeter.“Stay put,” I said.  I seized his foot and pulled it down, then undid the laces on his boots.  I tied them around a branch.  “I can make you more comfortable and leave you a way down if you talk.”“Fuck you,” he said.  He clung tight to a branch.I tied the laces of his other boot to another branch.  Then I identified a few key branches he could use to climb down, and, strength up, demolished the first with a sharp strike.“Shit!” he said, voice going higher as the branch he was on wobbled.  “Shit!”I broke another.  Not the cleanest break, it might have served as a foothold or handhold.  I kicked it again to make it less of one.When three branches were broken and there was a good ten feet between the branch he was on and the nearest handhold or foothold, I flew back, assessing the situation.  He couldn’t let go of the trunk in front of the branch he was sitting on, and he couldn’t bend low enough to untie his laces, even if he could let go.“I’m not going to say shit,” he said.You just did, a few times, I thought.  My expression remained deadpan.I didn’t give him a response.  Instead, I left him where he was, and flew down to the ground.There was a time when using my powers had made me feel powerful.  Having superstrength had made me feel strong.  Having an aura that instilled awe had made me feel awesome.I didn’t feel that same rush now.  I felt melancholy.There were more coming through the trees.  They didn’t seem especially aware of me, or mindful of the earlier gunfire.More people in leather jackets.  Beards and some sunglasses.  I flew up to a higher branch.Bikers, except these guys didn’t have bikes with them.  They’d be part of the Fallen’s network.  While Prancer’s side of Hollow Point seemed to be willing to play by the rules of the game, the Fallen hadn’t been so inclined, even before Gold Morning.  They hadn’t felt the social pressures because they hadn’t been part of society, living on the fringes and putting a wall between themselves and others.  They’d had allies of necessity for certain events and causes, and the bikers had been some of those allies.When people hadn’t been able to go after the Fallen, the pressures and responses for the Fallen’s actions had come to rest on the heads of the bikers and other allies.  People had been less willing to deal with them, more force had been used against them, and the message had been driven home.The problem with the cycle was that being on the outs made them more likely to bend or break the rules.  The wedge between them and everyone else had also made them more inclined to simply fold into the Fallen, especially after Gold Morning.The amnesty was a thing, crimes had been pardoned, but feelings were still feelings.  The bikers had backed up some of the shittiest people around, and that was hard to let go of.There were three people moving through the trees as a group.  Their attention seemed to be fixed on flanking Hollow Point.  That would’ve been the motorcycle guy’s intention too, then.  Getting around behind and opening fire.Two of them were heavy, and could’ve been brothers.  One of the heavy ones had a tattoo that was partially obscured by his glasses, and a goatee.  The other had a metal shackle of a collar around a neck that really was too wide for most metal collars.  It made skin bulge out the top and bottom.  Similar shackle-like cuffs were at his wrists and ankles, but they weren’t so bulgy.The one in the center was a breaker.  He was a wraith of a person, a statue broken up into solid segments that were hard and almost ceramic in appearance, with electric blue lines spiraling around each of the jet black, ceramic-ish, solid parts.  They were connected to other parts by only a deep blue smoke that was hard to look too deeply at.  His face was less of a face and more of a solid, triangular surface with a series of six or seven holes bored into it.  Each hole was ridged with a corkscrew pattern, cone-shaped.He didn’t walk and he didn’t fly.  He had legs that existed as a jumble of segments, they moved, and he kind of was in places.  It reminded me of the animated optical illusions where circles continually rippled outward and appeared to grow endlessly, but they didn’t actually grow.In his case, the lines and edges of the harder body moved and rippled back, he appeared to stay in place, but he actually moved, with the indigo-blue smoke billowing out behind him.Two guns.  Shackle-guy had a handgun, and the guy with the goatee had a shotgun.  Breakers didn’t tend to have gear.I flew over their heads, and I saw that the breaker’s face wasn’t three dimensional.  It was such that no matter what angle I viewed it from, it always faced me.He didn’t react like he saw me, though.  Not just yet.One of the most underrated things about flying was that it was silent.I took advantage, lowering myself down behind the guy with the goatee.The spiraling on the breaker’s arm intensified.  I adjusted my flight course- realized belatedly that he was swiping at me.  It was hard to process his movements, because he seemed to retroactively be wherever he was going.  It was my perceptions, I was pretty sure, and not time manipulation or anything.He swiped again, and I maneuvered, moving around his buddy at the same moment.  He had reach, arm extending as the gap widened between the floating segments of forearm, and parts of a hand.I shone with my aura, no longer being subtle, seizing the shotgun and put my foot on the goatee guy’s shoulder.  I flew up and pushed down and out with my foot.  My interest was twofold- to kick him toward his breaker buddy’s arm, and  to use full-body leverage to get the shotgun out of his hand.  He had good trigger discipline, and so me pulling the gun away didn’t also pull the trigger against his finger.I had the shotgun and I’d put myself far enough away to be out of the blue breaker’s reach.  I brought out the wretch and had it demolish the shotgun in my hands.If I was going to use an all-or-nothing weapon, I’d rather use the ones I was familiar with.Still turning in the air, I traveled an unpredictable course, arcing down to the ground, hugging the ground as I traveled a quarter-circle arc, ever-mindful of the guy with handgun.  He aimed at me and fired.His bullet hit the wretch, and I hit him at the knees, bowling him over.Before he was on his feet, and before the blue breaker could swipe at me, I grabbed him by the ankles.  Flying, I dragged him across the forest floor.  More to the point, I dragged him in a way that put his upper body and face closer to the ground as I dragged him.He grabbed me by the wrist, and it took me a second to realize the how and why of it.  I’d had him by the ankle, and his foot was now a hand.  He was strong- enough that I thought something would pop or break if he squeezed any harder.I changed course, and I flew him into the base of a tree trunk.  I heard the solid impact, and I felt the ‘leg’ I was holding jerk in reaction to the pain, but I didn’t succeed in breaking his grip.He had a foot where his head had been, and hands at the end of neck, ankle, and each arm.  The shackles seemed to be the point where the changes happened.  When he bent to bring a hand toward my face, it was with a crease between what should have been crotch and shoulder and far more flexibility than a man his size should have managed.  I struck his hand away with a backhand strike, my forearm catching his wrist.  Another hand grabbed me by the belt.My focus, though, was on the hand that still held the handgun.  He had his bearings, and he brought it around to point it at me.  I seized it, fingers hooked around barrel and handle both.I hated guns being brought to a cape fight.I twisted around, heaving him up and bringing the wretch to bear for some added strength at the last moment.  I slammed him into the tree, harder.His grip weakened.  I wanted to fly away, but we both still had a mutual, contested grip on the weapon.The breaker was coming for me, swelling in my vision.  It reached, and fingers brushed through foliage.  The greenery stretched like it was ooze, strands and bends and all.When it snapped, it coiled and curled away like smoke, black with blue sparks in it, like a burning paper might have orange.The rule for fighting breakers was to not fight them in their breaker state, because the breaker states tended to cheat the rules.I couldn’t wrestle the handgun free, even with the shackled biker weak from his second visit to the tree’s trunk.  I bent his wrist back as far as it could, his fingers bending backward as I brought the gun over to one side.  His hand began changing, the front of the hand becoming the back, fingers finding angles to grip the gun.  He reaffirmed his grip.He did, however, also lose a bit of ground around the trigger.  I checked, then shifted my grip more to the handle and the area around the trigger guard, before pulling the trigger repeatedly.  Not easy, given the angle.  Not easy, when each shot kicked and was loud, and I had a breaker lurking at the corner of my vision, not registering as having any depth in my depth perception.I wasn’t quite sure what would happen, but I gripped one of the shackles.  For just a moment, I let the wretch out, giving myself the strength to crush it in my hand.For that same moment, the wretch did something, and the entire body jerked, cloth ripping.The metal shackle broke, and the hand spasmed, letting go of the handgun.There was a wound in his stomach, and it closed as he lay there.  At the same time, his hand multiplied, swelled, had fingers and teeth appear, and became a misshapen blob.  The effect crawled up his arm to his body, which bloated and swelled.A mouth opened in the middle of it.  It snapped in my general direction.I pushed my aura out as hard as I could.  The mass of flesh withdrew into itself.  The breaker stopped.I stared down at the changer-in-flux.  A mess of hands, a mess of legs, teeth, fleeting facial features.My aura radiated intense fear and awe, enough to stop grown men and monsters in their tracks, and in the midst of it all, I felt that melancholy.“This?” I spoke.  “What you’re feeling is a four.  The dial goes up to ten.”The breaker’s fingers traced the side of a tree.  The wood became goo and it stretched.“You can feel the intensity of it, can’t you?” I asked.  “You do not want me to turn up this dial.  Because this?  This is a six.”I was close enough to trees and ground that when I brought the wretch out, it could reach those things.  It broke up the dirt and it bit into wood with fingers.  The wood creaked until hands clenched hard enough to break it, and then it broke explosively.“If I turn it up any higher, you’ll feel that too,” I said.  I had the handgun.  I looked down at it to figure out how to release the magazine.  I threw the magazine down to the ground and held out the gun.There was a moment’s pause, and then the wretch took hold of the weapon.  It flung it out, slamming it into a tree hard enough that it sank into the wood of the trunk.Still maintaining a grip on the weapon, the wretch dragged it about a foot toward the base of the trunk before it couldn’t anymore.  A moment later, the metal began distorting.  Something broke and fell.“You, blue breaker.  Go back to being human.  All of you stand down.”Goatee looked at his friend or brother.  The wretched thing at the base of a tree.  He didn’t stand down, and the breaker didn’t go human.Maybe it was a minion for goatee guy.  It was a hell of a minion, if so.  Whatever it was, minion or breaker, I wasn’t about to change my policy on staying the hell away from it.The breaker started toward me.  It stopped when orange motes began appearing.  I dismissed the wretch, watching as they looked around.“That,” I said.  “Is an eight.”The breaker reached out and touched a mote.  It stretched the mote in the air.  There were lines around it, and it pushed through trails that had been left behind motes, distorting them too, stretching them like it had the leaf.“I’m pretty sure you don’t want to do that,” I said.It stopped.Sveta’s hand reached through the trees, grabbed goatee guy, and hauled him into the orange motes.Everything snapped into being, except the lines the breaker had altered.  They remained where they were, jumping around, wiggling and distorting, before they found a solid form as a spray of rock fragments.  I brought my defenses up just in time to deflect the worst of it.The goatee guy was caught, orange motes around his legs.  The breaker waded through it like it was glue.The stone became water.  The breaker no longer waded through it, instead struggling to hold its general shape as the water pushed and sprayed through the smoke.  Some of the water was forceful enough to bring small branches down from trees overhead.As the water’s spray dissipated, the breaker sagged.  The smoke was mostly gone.  It crumpled, and the segments dissolved into a thicker smoke.  As they blew away, one of the bikers was left in the center.  A mid-thirties woman with a blue tank-top with a faded motorcycle logo on the front, a potbelly, and a complexion to match the most acne-ridden teenager from my old high school.“It’s an eight,” I said, quiet and mostly to myself, “But it’s not my eight.”She started to get to her feet, then slipped in the mud.  She remained hunched over.“We need to have a conversation,” I said.She spat.“Your friend.  He okay?”“He gets like that sometimes.”“Okay,” I said.  I tried to avoid looking at the shuffling mass of flesh.  Before, it had been only the hands, feet, and head that had changed.  Now it was everything but those things.On a level, I felt bad that I couldn’t look straight at it and that I’d been hurt by others that had once been unable to look straight at me.On another level, I knew even I’d had a hard time looking straight at me, when I’d been that way.  I still did.  I’d never really blamed anyone.  For abandoning me, yes, but not for not looking.“You’re going to tell us the layout of the Fallen camp.”“Can’t,” she said.  “Fuck.”“The anti-thinker measure.  Where and who?”“Can’t.”The others emerged from the woods.  Sveta.  Capricorn in blue.“You’re going to need to give me something,” I said.“We came to help out the Crowleys.  We hang with them sometimes.  They’re harmless,” she said.  “The- other branch, it isn’t.”“The Mathers,” I said.“I’m being told to tell you something.  You don’t need to hide at the fringes.  You’re welcome to join in, and you’re expected.  They- they’ll embrace you with open arms.”“You’re being told?”“Fuck them, and fuck this,” the woman with the blue top said.  “Not what I signed up for.  They got us in here, we were partying last night, and then, out of nowhere-”“Hey,” the guy with the goatee said.“Her,” she finished.  She turned her head away.  “I can’t explain.  She says she has hostages.  People you know and people who those people care about.  You can mess with the attackers, but if you get in the way of the Fallen, people are going to lose body parts.”Byron spoke up, “Can you take a message back to her?”“I don’t know,” the biker woman said, sullen.  “I don’t-”She paused.“What?” Byron asked.“She says no, no messages.  Other stuff.  She-”Her eyes went wide.  She looked around, her eyes not focused on anything in particular.The woman’s voice carried forward, but it was an inarticulate sound, one that became higher, then a warbling shriek, followed by a gasp for air with a sound of its own.She dropped to the ground, fingers clawing in dirt, twisting like she was trying to get away from everything at once.  The noises she made were horrible, and I’d heard some awful noises in my life.Goatee guy started to approach her.  He stopped when I flew a little closer.“Stop.  What do you do?”“Do?  I’m decent with a gun.”“That’s your power?”“No.  No powers,” he said.  He sounded stunned by the question.  In the moment, I could see how bothered he was and I had trouble believing he could concoct a good lie.The woman was curled up now.  She pulsed, and with each pulse, dark cracks ran across her body and over her clothes, then faded away.After a few tries, she stopped trying.  She shrieked, and then strangled the shriek.“Is there anything we can do for her?” Sveta asked.“We could try knocking her out,” Capricorn said.  It was Tristan now.  “But it’s not like in movies.  That kind of thing does brain damage.”“I think this does damage of its own,” I said.“Yeah, well, if you want to try the middle ground of making her brain go dark without breaking her head open, you go right ahead,” Tristan said.“Let’s not fight, please,” Sveta said.  She looked at the thrashing woman.  “Shit.”I flew to the woman.  It took me a second of wrestling with her before I could get my hands around her throat.  Her hands reached beneath my sleeves and got a few scratches in at my forearm.I shifted my grip, and I choked her, heels of my hands pressing in.  I pulled away when she went limp and the struggling ceased.  Unconscious, not dead.I didn’t need to ask before orange motes began to appear.  Restraints, so she wouldn’t hurt herself.“You’ll need to stay with your friends,” I said, to the guy with the goatee.He nodded, slumping to a sitting position on the ground.  He didn’t even seem to care he was sitting in mud.Tristan walked away, and Sveta and I both followed.“Where’s our fourth?” I asked.“Sent him ahead.  He’s out there and he’ll change soon,” Tristan said.  He pointed.  North and deeper into the woods.  Chris would be closer to the Patrol block guys, then.Good enough.We were wordless from that point on.  We cut through the woods, and we reached their edge, where tree stumps of varying height speared up from the ground.Across the clearing were hills with stones piled up around them, no doubt cleared from the fields, and houses, large but rustic.  Two of those houses were on fire, and one had been partially leveled.A blip of something green shot from the sky to the ground, far enough away it felt like it was on the horizon, when it was really on the far side of the settlement.  The ground shook where we were in response.If that wasn’t indicator enough of where the focus of the fighting was, I could hear the distant shriek of Ashley’s power.  I made eye contact with Sveta, then Capricorn.Hostages.  Guns.  Turning allies into pawns.  Inflicting something that serious on someone?No games here.  No illusions of any games, even.For all the issues of our motley team, where so often we could have three people on entirely different pages, I could look at Sveta and I could look at Tristan, and I could know they understood this.  The Fallen in particular had gone off the deep end.  They’d abandoned their last vestiges of responsibility as capes and as human beings.That left us the responsibility of giving them an appropriate response.                                                                                        Shadow – 5.9                                                                                        A fence gave us cover as we made our way to the nearest house.  It had been damaged earlier in the skirmish, to the point that a third of the house was missing, part of the ground floor and part of the upper floor.  A good chunk of that part of the building was strewn over the small field behind the house.The ongoing fight was still far away.  I could hear gunfire and see periodic light shows.  I would have liked to take a hand in things, but I didn’t want to break from the plan to work the edges of the scene.  The innocents first.  Evacuation.“Hey!” Capricorn called out.  “Civilians?”“Try us and see!” was the response, coming down from above.  The man was upstairs.Capricorn looked over at Sveta and I, giving us a dumbfounded shrug.“We’re good guys!” Sveta called out.  “We’re evacuating people who aren’t part of the fight!”“Yeah?”“We’ll tell you where to go.  There are people in uniform waiting at the edge of the woods.  They’ll take you somewhere safe,” Sveta said.There was a murmured conversation between the people on the upper floor.  I could only hear the sound of it.  Worried, tense, a word that might have been a swear word from the guy.“We were stranded up here.  Stairs got trashed, and floor looks unsteady,” the guy said.  “We’ll take that offer if you help us down.”Someone else upstairs spoke to the guy, voice tense and urgent.“We can do that,” Sveta said.The voices upstairs went quiet.“I could use my power to secure the building,” Capricorn said.  “Making it permanent would mean taking the barricades I made between here and either getting rid of them or making them permanent too.”I looked back.  As we’d made our way between the forest and the first house, Capricorn had erected short walls for cover against gunfire.  Some cut into field and road.It seemed like such a simple thing, but it said a lot about our presence here and what we were doing.  The more walls, the safer the route for people to follow as they evacuated, but it also made life harder for anyone who came back here to live in the settlement again.  With some of the walls edging into the road, it also created the low-level risk that if Hollow Point was going to end the attack and leave, they’d have a hard time getting out.Did we want to burn their bridge behind our enemies, when they were fighting something bigger and nastier?  The best case scenario here was that the Fallen were neutralized and Hollow Point was left without any true merits to their name.  Setting up Hollow Point to find there wasn’t a place to run to?  To die?  Worse?No.  Not when I’d seen the breaker woman go through the ‘worse’.“Can you clear away the walls near the road?” I asked.Capricorn nodded.He started toward the edge of the broken wall, so he’d be able to see what he was working on.  I put my hand out, flat against the front of his armor, stopping him.The people upstairs were too quiet.  After the tense conversation among the members up there, the silence felt off.I checked to make sure the ongoing fighting was still far away and that our flanks were clear of trouble, put the forcefield up and ventured out first.At the edge of the broken floor, a pair of men were crouching.  What seemed to be two families were gathered in the room behind them, peering through the door.  The men and their wives looked more like older teens or twenty-ish, and the kids I could see were four or five.The floor was shattered, that section of the upstairs open to the outdoors.  Slats of the floor that hadn’t been broken when the damage had been done now stabbed out into open air.“I can bring the kids down,” I said.“My wife first,” the older of the two guys said.  “She’ll look after them as you bring them down.”“Sure,” I said.Behind me, Capricorn ventured out.  He began drawing the motes.  I watched how the younger of the two guys kept his eyes on Capricorn, then leaned forward a bit, floor creaking under him, as he tried to peer down at the orange lights and the outlined trails.A narrow young woman with brown hair and a red bandanna at her neck ventured forward along the more intact portions of the floor.  She hesitated, looking at the guy I presumed was her husband, a blond guy with peach fuzz facial hair and greasy, medium-length hair combed into a fauxhawk.  He had tattoos at his neck and at the backs of his hands.“Go on,” he said.She ventured forward.  The damaged floor creaked ominously, and she stopped.I flew closer to her, one eye on the two men.“I’ve got you,” I said, taking her wrists in my hands.Her husband reached behind his back and drew a handgun as I focused on making sure I had a grip.  I could have reacted, but I didn’t, focusing on the woman instead.  He leveled the weapon at my head.“I’m trying to help you and your family,” I said.“You’re going to help us, yeah,” he said.  “You’re going to stay with me, and your friend down there is going to do what I say.”This wasn’t an auspicious start.“You alright, Victoria?” Capricorn asked.“I’m fine,” I said.  I verified the wife wouldn’t fall if I let go, then released her wrists.  She backed away.The guy didn’t seem to like how unbothered I seemed.  I was worried, I knew what might happen if he fired two bullets, and if he panicked, he might empty the gun at me.  I’d had someone do that, once.Downstairs, Capricorn picked his way across the shattered floorboards and bits of roof as he walked backward.“You stay,” the guy with the fauxhawk and the gun said.Capricorn looked off to his left.He was looking at Sveta.  That worked.The wife with the red bandanna ushered the kids further into the room.  She shut the door.Just the two men, Capricorn and I.And, faster than I’d expected, Sveta at an open window, past a door into another room upstairs.“You’re going to go run off that way, armor boy, staying where I can see you until you’re a speck in the distance,” the man with the gun said.  “Direction of the big house.  It got trashed, but there should be people around there.  I want you to report some things, starting with the fact we’re holed up here, and the attacking group went past us.  We can get them from behind.  Got it?  Then you’re going to come back the same way and report-”I met Sveta’s eyes and nodded.“-to us.  Why are you nodding, bitch?” the man asked.Sveta’s hand went out.  She missed the gun, but stopped extending her arm.  It came to rest on his arm, fingers hooking over the top, and pulled it back and away.Wretch up, I flew into the floor beneath the man’s feet.  Already damaged, it broke further, the floor under him becoming a slope.I reached out to catch, and got my hand around the gun.  He fell the rest of the way, his hands out, wrists catching the worst of the impact on uneven ground.  He fell to his side a moment later, groaning.  The timing of the fall was weirdly off, but only because he’d had to figure out how to pull back and not be resting his upper body weight on two injured wrists.The other guy put his hands up.“Can you do cuffs?” I asked Capricorn.“I can.  I can splint, while I’m at it,” he said.  He bent down by the guy.  “If I do it wrong, though, it’s going to be fifteen pounds of rock hanging off of those hands of yours.  You going to cooperate?”The guy on the ground below spat.“Yeah.  Big man.  Keep those arms still,” Capricorn said.  He gave me a look, eyes visible behind the eyeholes of his helm.The door cracked open.  The woman peered out.“Do we need to worry about you too?” I asked her.“No.  Are you still offering that way out?”“Yeah.  Come on, hurry up,” I said.“Sorry my husband’s an asshole,” she said.“Mom,” the kid behind her said.“He is,” she said.  “Don’t be like your dad, okay?”Good enough, I supposed.I flew her down to the ground, then flew the kids two at a time.  The second wife and then the man were last.  We led them back and away, and the gunman with his lower arms encased in a single growth of stone was last.I imagined he could use that stone as a makeshift weapon if he had a mind to, but it was hard to picture him being very effective that way, especially when possibly broken wrists were encased in the middle.  Knee-buckling pain, I imagined.I wasn’t sure if Capricorn had similar reservations, but he withdrew a bit of cord from his belt, and he used orange motes to fix one end to the cuffs and another bit to the guy’s belt.  He steered the guy with one hand at his shoulder.Sveta came around the corner of the house.  She put out one hand, and I slapped her hand with mine, holding it for a moment in a victory squeeze.This?  As melancholy as everything else could be, I liked this.“You’re leaving.  We’re going to head that way,” I said, indicating the path we’d made, with the walls for cover.  “Any advice on where to go?  Houses with children?”“Most houses have children or people under eighteen,” the wife said, guiding her kids much like Capricorn guided her errant husband.  “The red house.  Abby looks after some of the children when the parents go to war or go into the city.”“Do they have weapons?” Capricorn asked.“Of course.  We hunt deer and rabbit when we can.”“The leadership’s house is totally gone,” the other woman observed.  “They hit it first.”I looked in the direction she was facing.  At the corner of the camp, near the point where the road disappeared into the forest, one of the larger houses had been leveled.On the alert for any drawn weapons, I caught the man putting his hand on his wife’s arm.  She looked down.I hated that.  I hadn’t seen it often, over the years, but it got under my skin when I did.  From the time I was young, my mom had drawn attention to those things after the fact, when we did some crisis point stuff, responding to domestic violence calls, or when she introduced me to a police detective and his wife she knew.  She’d remark on the dynamics between husband and wife, the power plays, and the signs that something else was going on.  The intent was to make me aware, and to ensure I’d avoid those same things when I got into a relationship.“If we send these guys out to the people at the edge of the forest, will you stick with us?” I asked the wife.  “I don’t want to repeat this thing with having to fight you guys to help you.”She looked at the other woman.  “You’ll look after my kids?”“Of course.”“She’s my sister,” the wife said.  “If she’s got my kids, then I’m okay giving you directions.”“Go,” Capricorn said.  He gave the one guy a shove.  “Straight line that way.  They’re not going to arrest you unless you cause trouble.”“Don’t be an asshole, Tony,” the wife said.  “If you did break your wrists, you’re going to need someone to wipe your tush.  I’ve told you before, I’ll only make your life easy if you return the favor.”“Fuck off,” Tony said, with an exhausted sort of emphasis on ‘off’.  “We’re going.  I’m getting away from Nan.”“Yeah,” the other guy said.The family made their way.  They ducked low by the walls, and Tony had to squat and waddle in way I found a little amusing, his knees apart and hands down.“Nan?” I asked the wife.“Yeah.  Short for Nancy.”“Alright,” I said.  “You’re good, here?  I don’t need to worry about you?”“Family first, friends second, Fallen and faith third,” she said.  “If this is what we’re having to deal with here, I don’t want it.  I’ll help you get some others I know out.”Right.  It wasn’t because it was ‘right’, but because of her specific priorities.  Something to be careful of.“We ran into someone who wigged out, full sanity breakdown,” Capricorn said.  “Same with you?”“Not with me.  I’m… background.  I can’t say much more.”“Yeah, we got the same from them, too,” he said.  “Come on.”Anyone who was anything had a gun to their heads, it sounded like.  The people with powers, the people who’d come in to help were now obligated to, and nobody seemed willing or able to elaborate on particulars.It made me nervous.  The idea of the brain-fucking stuff bothered me more than the shackled guy turning into the Wretch-like flesh puddle, back in the woods.  My heart didn’t race, but each pound of it felt monumental and heavy in my chest.We made our way to the next house.  It was more intact than the last, but getting to it without risking being shot by anyone in the windows was tricky.  Too much open space between buildings.The woman pulled off her bandanna, then held it over her head, venturing into the open space.  Nobody shot.  She approached the house, and the side door opened.  A middle-aged man met her on the extended stairs that acted as a kind of porch.She beckoned for us to approach.  I decided to do it, because I had my defenses.I was very aware that the sound of the ongoing confrontation had changed.  Things had moved closer.  It was hard to map out just where people were, because the camp had a more village-like settlement stabbing through the lower half of it, dense enough to block the view of the streets and the far side.  The settlement was densest in the southeast, closer to the road and the ‘big house’.  There were more scattered houses and fields to the north and west.  Those would be harder to reach.I flew to the house, landed on the grass, and walked to the porch.  Arriving directly at the porch could be seen as threatening.“What’s on the far side of the trees?” the middle-aged guy asked.  He had a salt-and-pepper beard and broad shoulders.  He looked like a farm worker, with tattoos that would’ve been fit for a sailor if they had been less biblical and more nautical.“People in uniform,” I said.  “They’re armed, but they’ll only shoot if they see weapons.  You should leave yours behind.”He glanced at Nan.“They’ll guard you, and they won’t arrest you,” I said, firmly.“You say.  We don’t have guarantees.”“You don’t,” I said.  “But as much as people don’t like you guys as a whole, people have no grudge with you and the amnesty holds until you’re charged with something.  Only the ones in charge are a concern, and that’s mostly because that’s how they handled this whole thing.”“It’s cute you think that,” he said.  “We never had fair treatment, and I don’t think we’re going to get it now.”“We’re here.  Some of our people are risking getting shot, even by some of you guys.  Do you want to be treated fair?  Take the help that’s offered.”“If we want to be treated fair, the only sure way is to rely on each other,” he said.  “That’s not saying we won’t listen to you, but I’m not sure, here.”I set my jaw, lips pressing together momentarily, because the alternative was that they’d part and I’d say something.  I didn’t like these guys.  I didn’t respect what they were about.“Tony and Nan’s sister left,” I said.  “They didn’t have as much of a problem with it.”“Tony had a brain infection when he was young, and he was never that right after,” the guy said.“He’s nice to look at, though,” a woman said, from the background.“Mm,” Nan grunted.  She sighed.  “You guys were the first I came to, to let you know.  I thought that was right of me.  Do me a favor?  Let these people go on their way.  They can collect the… ones who are scared.”“The less loyal,” the woman from before said, from behind the guy with the salt and pepper beard.“We’re not all soldiers, Mare,” Nan said, and her voice was hard.  “Some have kids and they won’t know what to do except run or lose their minds.  Houses are falling down.  Mine’s gone, Tony and my bed, even.  It makes sense to run, I think.  That doesn’t mean we’re disloyal.  It means we’re fucking trying to survive.”“Fighting’s tilting this way,” the guy said.  “I think the intruders are coming here.  We’re going to hold the line, make sure they can’t retreat back this way.  You want to go?  Go.  You come back after.”“I’m not going to fucking disappear on you, Enoch.  I’m a believer.  I’ve put up with Tony, for fuck’s sake, from the end of the world to the hereafter.  Four months, I dragged him and two kids around until I found you all again.  Why would I leave now?”“How should I know what squirrely thoughts you have in your head, Nan?  If you’re going, then fuck off.  The fighting’s getting closer.  You don’t have long.”“I can take the kids if you want.  Get them out of your hair.”“You can fuck right off,” Enoch said.I folded my arms.“Enoch,” the woman from before said.  “Let ’em.  We had one of the little ones with a bullet in his mouth, twenty minutes ago.  They were suckling on the thing.  Nan’s right.  They’re in the way.”“The little ones.  Maise and Jake can stay.  Maise is ten and she can hold a rifle.  Jake’s a decent shot.”“You’re insisting on staying?” I asked.“I said what I said.  I’m playing nice here.  If you want to be a hardass on this, I can be less nice.”I hated these guys.“Get the kids,” Nan said.I backed away, and waited for Nan to round the people up.  Capricorn had created a barricade that intersected the fence around the field, blocking some of the path too.  He and Sveta knelt by it.“They’re rounding up some kids,” I said.  “A good size group is inside.  Guy called Enoch.  They’ve got some kids in there, and they’re going to start shooting if Hollow Point shows their faces.”I heard a distant holler that might have been Beast of Burden.  The fact they were close enough for me to hear-“Fighting is trending this way,” Capricorn said.  “Sounds like that might happen soon.”“Victoria, you worded that like the kids were going to be doing the shooting,” Sveta said.“Some are.  The very young are getting evacuated.  I’ll go back and get more info, but there are kids Kenzie’s age and younger with guns in their hands and parents expecting them to shoot.”“No,” Sveta said.  “No, that’s not right.”“No,” I agreed.  “Do you think you can do anything about it, Capricorn?”“Without tipping them off?” he asked.  He looked at the building.  “Shit.  I’d need to keep an eye on things and stay close.”Meaning we’d be close to any fighting that erupted and we’d have to deal with Enoch’s group if they found a way out and happened to be pissed off.A stray bullet clipped the side of the house, twenty feet from us.  I huffed out the half-breath I’d intended to use to say something.“Do it,” I said.  I flew over to the house.  Nan was gathering the kids.  Some had bags.“We’re ready.”“Through the woods.  Keep going as straight as you can.  There are more hero capes to the far north, you don’t want to go that way.  Too far east and you might run into the villains as they back out.  Northeast.”Nan nodded.“They’ll take you into custody and keep you safe.  What other houses here do I need to go to?”“Three houses down,” she indicated.  “Tony’s cousin.  There’ll be kids.”I hadn’t missed what she’d said earlier.  The friends and family thing.  She protected her own, and her advice was suspect for that reason.  “What about the houses between here and there?  Empty?”“One should be empty.  Last night it was all soldiers, and they’re off fighting, or they should be.  House with the sheets hanging on the line is only one person.  She does the services some days.  It’s not worth the time or effort, the cranky bitch never listens to anyone.”Yeah.  There we were.“Tony’s cousin.  What can I tell them, that they’ll think it’s from you?”“Tell him Nan said Tony’s gonna need him.”“Alright,” I said.  “Go.  I’ll handle it.”Sveta hauled herself over the fence, then approached so she stood a distance away.  As Nan began getting the kids and one man that looked to be about seventy on their way, Sveta guided them, bending low and giving the kids instructions on where to go.Most looked back to Nan for guidance, and she urged them on.“Vic!” Capricorn called out.I turned his way.“When they get to the woods, have ’em call for Self-reflection!”“Nan,” I said.There were sixteen kids, and Nan was still near the door, urging them on.  She had some of the young ones stay close to her, and when someone slightly older came out, she paired them up, clasping their hands together, before sending them on their way.  She had to take ten or so seconds to get kids sorted before she could spare a moment to respond to me.“What?”“When you get to the woods, call out ‘reflection’, loud as you can.”“Why?”“Because like you said to Tony, we’re helping you, so help us a bit.  This only helps you guys where it counts.”She frowned a bit, but she nodded.I took flight, leaving things to Sveta and Nan.The ‘cranky’ woman’s place first.  I flew to the door, and knocked, hard.  The mailbox had only ‘Sims’ on it.  No number.“What?” the answer came from within.“I’m a hero from out of town.  We’re evacuating people.  Fighting’s coming this way.”The door opened.  The woman was older, but not as old as I’d expected.  Her hair was black, with streaks of white running through it.  Her clothing style was very severe, much of the neck covered, sleeves to the wrists, dress to the ankle.  She looked me over, staring through the screen door.“If you want to go, there are people waiting.  Some buildings have been knocked down.  It could happen here.”“Who else is going?”“Nan’s family, I’ll be talking to Tony’s cousin next door in a second.”“Screws loose, all of them,” she said.  “The nonsense they spew, the criminal stuff.  It’s all madness.”“You can get out,” I said.  “Just head into the woods, go straight, it’s not that thick a patch of woods, and there are people on the other side.  They’ll take care of you.”“I’ll go,” she said.  “Thank you.”“Of course,” I said.Before I could go, she grabbed my wrist.  Her fingers were bony.“I’ve got others to help,” I said.“There’s right and there’s wrong,” she said.  “You can do everything right, moment by moment, and still end up on the wrong side, too beaten down to fight things anymore.”Why this?  Why now?  I had the feeling it was more of a confession than advice.  She wasn’t Fallen, not at heart?  She’d just… ended up here?How the hell did that happen?Maybe that in itself was the confession.“I’ve been beaten down before,” I said.  “I’ll find a way to keep fighting.  Humans are resilient.  We made it through Gold Morning.”“It’s very easy to lose sight of how beaten down you are,” she said.  “Don’t let the little things slide.  We have to be vigilant.”“We do,” I said.  “Part of my vigilance is making sure those kids survive.  I need to go next door.  If you want help getting out, ask for a guy called Gilpatrick, okay?  He’s one of the best people I know, and his whole job is knowing and providing resources to people who need it.”She looked back at her house.  She released my wrist and pulled the door closed, drawing herself up taller.“Bless,” she said.  “Many of these people do not deserve to be saved.”I could have responded.  I decided to keep my mouth shut.  I wanted her to go so I could help others, not to get caught in a conversation.Ducking low, she ran across the field, and I flew between her and the worst of the fighting with the wretch out, to provide a bit of a shield.At the edge of the settlement, where the buildings were thinning out, there was a thick cloud of black smoke.   Beast of Burden was there, and Damsel was standing behind him, using him as a shield.  I could see the spidery form of Nailbiter and I could make out crackles of lightning backed by dark smoke, along the dirt road and a nearby lean-to or outhouse.  There were some gunshots, and I could hear the revving of more bikes.I flew to the next house.  Someone was already on the porch, watching me and the distant fighting.  No gun pointed at me, only a look of worry from a guy with a high forehead and blond hair that really needed combing.  He had a boy with him, a bit younger than Kenzie, just as blond, just as disheveled, hair-wise.  No tattoos – I wouldn’t have known him for Fallen if I’d seen him on the street.  They looked like their clothes and even their bodies badly needed washing, like both were homeless, despite having a fairly large farmhouse to reside in.“Nan says Tony needs you,” I said.  “You need to get going.  Through the forest, people are waiting.  Don’t take any guns, or you might get yourself or your kid shot.”He asked something, his voice a mumble, as if his lack of self-care extended to not even bothering to form coherent words.“What?”“Tony went?” the kid interpreted.“Yeah,” I said.That was reason enough for them to go.  They took nothing except themselves, and they stuck close together.The fact that people were streaming from houses to the woods seemed to be cause for others to take the same route.  Three teenagers were running for it, now.  A girl with brown-blonde hair ran, guitar bouncing at her back.  There were two teenage boys, younger, with dark hair.  They ran to intercept Tony’s cousin and the boy, maybe to get answers.These were people Rain had lived with, seen every day.  This place, down to the guy who silenced his wife with a touch, the old woman, the people who didn’t take care of themselves, it had been his existence and the building blocks of experience he’d had to use to pull himself together.No sign of Erin.  I did want to help her.There were gunshots, close.  The people at Enoch’s house were shooting.  I could see the orange motes around the building, still weaving their way around and up.I flew in that direction, going higher to stay away from any likely stray bullets.  Over the ‘Sims’ house, over the empty house, then to the roof, where the peak would provide some cover.  Sveta and Capricorn were staying close together on the ground by the barricade.  Sveta peered over it.  Capricorn sat with his back to it, facing the house.More gunshots from within.Tristan had his hand clenched into a fist.  He opened it, and the points of light and traceries took form.  The building was wreathed in stone, blocking the windows and doors and shielding it from gunfire.The job was done, and Sveta and Capricorn both moved away from house and barricade, getting closer to the fighting, dropping down from the path to the field.  The dirt for the dirt road to this row of houses had been piled up, so the water would run off the sides, with stones rolled over to separate the looser dirt from the fields.  The two of them stayed closer to the stone divider, hunkering down so the hump of road provided some protection.The people in the house weren’t happy.We’d have to protect it.  We’d assumed that responsibility.I peered around the peak of the building as the people drew near enough I could see their costumes in detail.Beast of Burden was constantly backing up as others advanced.A guy with the proportions of an older teenager that hadn’t quite grown to match his lanky frame was advancing, arms out to his sides.  A hood of what looked like flesh was wrapped around a hard mask or helmet.  It looked like two human faces with distorted features had been cut away from their owner’s heads, carved into strips, and then bound together, with gaps in both the skin-strips and helmet for him to peer through.  A ‘mouth’ yawned open around one eye, and a diagonal slash of a gap between two other strips provided an opening for the other.  His eyes were blue sparks of light.I could see the range of his power.  He was the source of the dark smoke and blue arcs of lightning that danced over every surface, Beast of Burden included.  Everything in his field of view was affected, and wooden fences, weeds, and bits of wood on the road sparked and ignited.  Things closer to him seemed more affected.  At about thirty meters, the effect seemed negligible.Nailbiter backed away, moving with some agitation as her pointed feet stuck into the softer dirt of the road, her mobility hampered.  Light arced briefly and fiercely between two of her extended fingers, and she shook her hand.I could see Sidepiece and Disjoint as part of the group.  Beast of Burden’s clique, separated from Prancer’s and now matched in number.There were other Fallen.  A young woman, with a face-concealing hood and scarf that was wound around her hair and down her back, voluminous sleeves around her arms, and no actual torso section to her costume.  A black belt at her chest covered only what was essential, and tattoos decorated the tanned skin of her stomach and sides.  She was guarding the one with the electric sight.Evacuating the innocents in the camp was one step.  Chances were that they’d go back to the Fallen after.  There was no way to get them to cooperate and refuse them that freedom, and the amnesty, as much as it sucked, protected them, even if their leaders were apparently breaking rules.Anarchy was the word, really.  We had to deal with the really problematic ones.Fallen-aligned capes on dirt bikes tore around a corner, kicking up dust behind them as they joined the fray.  Some of that dust reached up to the edges of roofs on two story buildings behind them.  Hoodlums, tattooed and wearing cheap demon masks.  Boys and girls.Maybe they were older than I was, but it was hard to see them and assign any kind of maturity.  I could hear them whooping as they split up, half of them racing along the right perimeter the darkness and electricity, half along the left perimeter.The first of them hit the edge of the dirt road Beast of Burden was on, using it as a ramp to go airborne.  Others followed suit.  They sailed to either side of Beast of Burden’s group, landed in fields and skidded around so they were behind the group, facing Damsel.Nailbiter reached out.  Her fingers struck one of the last bikers to jump.  They collided with the thin bars and she drew her fingers back to normal size.  The withdrawing and the motion against the biker’s front created slashes at the face, collarbone, chest, and lower stomach.  The last looked deep.Sidepiece, too, clawed her navel away from her midsection in an effort that took a second tug to separate some strings of still-connected skin, and then hurled that flesh to strike the ground a moment before the biker landed.  It detonated, and the biker bounced to the ground ten feet from their vehicle.Our side joined the fight.  Sveta yanked another one off of their bike.  Blue lights began appearing around the larger group as Capricorn started using Byron’s power.I took to the sky, trying to get a better sense of the battlefield.Prancer wasn’t that far away.  I could see people I was pretty sure were Speedrunners.  Prancer’s crew had guns, and they were shooting blind, because a power was obscuring their view of the street and things beyond.  Fallen were moving to flank.On the very far side of the confrontation where Prancer was involved, I could see the distortion of Vista’s power.We’d help this group first.  I looked for a good place to dive.  I could drop down by lightning-eyes, but I wasn’t sure about the hooded girl.Besides, it seemed like he was keeping Beast of Burden tied down.Fallen dirt-bikers first.Beast of Burden’s group second.I dropped down at a point more or less between one dirt-biking Fallen and Nailbiter, standing so I could see both.The Fallen in front of me raised a hand.  A deep black ellipse appeared at his fingertips, above his head.I could feel what he was doing, as the air seemed to leave the ‘room’.A black hole?  No.  Nothing non-gaseous seemed to be getting drawn in.  But my intake of breath felt thin, as if it supplied far too little.“Whoooooo!” he called out, and the cry was distorted and magnified by the dark blob he held overhead.  He revved his bike and charged me.I moved to meet him, holding my breath so I wouldn’t lose any.  The blob had an effect like my aura, but it was physical, changing the rules of the area around him, not anything emotional, and he seemed to have nuanced control.  His buddies weren’t suffering.I met his ambient effect with my own.  As he drew nearer, I pushed out with my aura, hard.I saw him waver.  On the other side of me, Nailbiter’s mouth yawned open, and her teeth speared out, criss-crossing, stabbing into dirt, field, stone, and toward the biker and me.  I was already flying back and out of the way.The guy threw his arm down.  The blob crashed into the road, and the bike rode the explosion as the effect released, taking to the air.Her hand went out.  She caught him out of the air with extended fingers, and let the bike fall while she held him in the air.She flicked her arm, hand going out.  As before, the rapid slide of finger against flesh had the effect of a serrated knife edge.  He was cut five different ways, and he crashed into the ground not far in front of lightning-eyes.The guy screamed and convulsed as the effect crackled over him, burning skin and setting his hair on fire.A dirt biker with a demon mask with red rips and gouges in pure white latex ‘skin’ drew a submachine gun, aiming it at Damsel.  Sveta grabbed his weapon, but failed to disarm him, as he maintained his grip.Instead, the biker with the white mask turned ghostly.  The ghostly image separated.  Several bikers now, each with variants on the theme, red mask with radioactive green gouges and blood, and a blue and yellow mask with red gouges and blood.All three had guns, and Sveta had only two hands.Capricorn’s image of blue lines and sparks came into being.  Water sprayed, violent and focused largely outward at the bikers.  Where it cascaded into the road, it left gouges of mud.  Beast of Burden stumbled as one spray caught him from behind.Ashley was already using the distraction to move.  She fired her power, directing it at the road, and launched herself into the air, dress and hair fluttering behind her.  The multifacted biker tried to get a bead on her, arms raised to shield eyes from spraying water, and she shot again, changing direction in the air.“Damsel!” Beast barked.  “I told you to not fucking shoot that so close to me!”I was already flying toward the multifacted Fallen bikers.  I used my aura to distract, and closed the distance, Wretch around me.Had someone been paying attention, they might have noticed the water tracing the edges of the Wretch.There was that melancholy feeling again.I closed the distance, and as it happened, so did Damsel.  I came at them from the northern end and she came at them from the southern side.  The one of the three that had a gun free turned to aim at Damsel.She shot with her power before he could pull the trigger, and crashed bodily into him.He split into another set of varieties.  Yellow-green, green-red, and purple-green.  Two of them drew knives.  One of the others was joining the fray too.I could see how wide Damsel’s eyes were, and I could see her lips move.Her hand went out, and she blasted.  The two in the range of the blast were quick enough to dodge away, and they didn’t move quite like humans anymore.  Too fast, too jerky.“Damsel!” Sidepiece called out.  “Get clear!”Damsel blasted, aiming at the ground with both hands and firing with both, kicking up dust and debris, and catching the front of the motorcycle, shredding it.The things avoided that blast as well, but as she moved skyward, Nailbiter and Sidepiece both went on the offensive.  Sidepiece threw two chunks, and Nailbiter clawed out.Several of the things seemed to die.  Others folded back into each other, and used the momentum of that reabsorption to leap backward.  They scrambled for the bike that had been abandoned when Sidepiece screwed up the rider’s landing.I could see Damsel panting hard.“Wretches!” she howled the words.  “Scum of the earth!  You do not deserve the breath you draw!”She was going to go over the top on them, and I wasn’t sure she was going to hold back or be just bark with no bite.  Not like she had during the test skirmish or the train ride with Presley.“Damsel!” I called out.She wheeled on me.  I saw her eyes widen as I dove.I put my hand at her neck and another at her arm.Carrying her, I flew her back and away from the fight.I could hear the sound of Byron’s power going off again, cutting into the earth, but my focus was on Ashley’s eyes beneath the black mask, lacking any pupil.  Her lips were parted to show teeth, and it wasn’t a smile.Off to the side, her fingers opened, spreading.She fired her power into the air.  I was flying, carrying her, and with the blast, we were forced off course.  We hit the soft dirt at the edge of the dirt road and landed in a heap together.I could have sworn at her, I could have been pissed.It wasn’t worth it.“Hi,” I said.  We were far enough away we wouldn’t be overheard by others.She pressed her lips together.  Her hand went to my neck, like I held hers.  Her fingers felt like real flesh should, but they were cooler than fingers should be.“This is an act, remember?”“I’m all out of patience,” she said.  “I’m ready to kill someone.”At the hospital, I’d dealt with a tinker who had the freak-out rants.  I’d dealt with people with distorted views of reality.  Mostly I’d dealt as an observer, sitting in for the group therapy.  I’d thought about what I wanted to say, cringed when people said the wrong things, and I’d written emails to support them or give advice after the fact.  Glacially, slowly.I wanted to handle this in a way that wouldn’t have any observers cringing.“Let’s not,” I said.  “We’re making progress here, okay?  Mission is going mostly according to plan, and you’re handling your bit well.  People are over-the-top amazed at how well you’re selling this.  Keep it a sale.  Keep it an act.  It’s good.”She exhaled, like she’d been holding in a breath or ten.  I felt her fingers relax at my neck.“You’re pissing him off?” I asked.“He’s pissing me off,” she said.  “But I’m getting to him.”“Good,” I said.“Damsel!” Sidepiece called out, drawing out the first sound into a longer ‘damn’ sound.  “If you’re done making out, we could use some help!”Some of the bikers that had been tossed from their rides were on their feet.  Lightning-eyes was pressuring Beast of Burden, forcing him into that plodding, slow retreat.“Can’t off her without risking her tearing my head off in a death-spasm!” Damsel called out.“Suck it up and figure it out!” Sidepiece called out.“So annoying,” Damsel hissed.A bike revved.  I could hear the approach.Damsel and I separated as it rode up the sloped side of the dirt road.  She blasted to create more distance for herself, and caught the edge of the bike’s tire.The blast served to throw the bike out from under the girl who’d been riding it.  The girl landed, skidding across dirt that had been packed by the passage of countless vehicles.“Stay down,” I said, as the Fallen girl started to get to her hands and feet.  I pushed out with my aura.She gave up, collapsing face down onto the road.Did she even have powers?  Did this particular group mix up those that did with those that didn’t?  What a hassle.Byron had directed most of his power at the road for the second blast.  It hampered Beast of Burden’s footing, and it dissolved a chunk of the road.  Sveta, as was her tendency, was lurking, looking for an opportunity to reach out.Crackling with lightning, Beast of Burden called something out- and Nailbiter snatched up two bikes, one damaged, that the convoy of Fallen had been riding.  She hurled them at Beast of Burden, and he caught one with each hand.Pressing them together into a makeshift shield, he charged at the lightning-eyes Fallen.  He made it nearly to the guy before the girl with the hood reached up and out.  Giant hands wrapped in black rags materialized between Beast of Burden and the two Fallen.Beast of Burden pressed on.  Another hand materialized, grabbing him, and he carried on forward, metal treads scraping through mud.Disjoint danced out to the side, practically skipping as he went from mud to solid ground, and slashed out with one hand, his hand disappearing.The woman with the hood fell, and she might have been grabbed by the same hand.  The hands disappeared, and Beast of Burden was momentarily reduced to only darkness and electricity as he took the brunt of the blast from lightning-eyes, even with the two motorcycles as an intervening barrier.He brought a motorcycle down as a club, and he swatted the Fallen guy with the vision power.  Then he brought the other bike down, hitting the girl who’d been thrown aside twice with overhead smashes.The lesser Fallen who remained didn’t have much fight in them.Beast of Burden’s horned head swiveled to look at us.  I flew back and away, so I’d have a good view of things.“Beast of Burden,” I called out.  “Bob.”He hurled a motorcycle at me.  He was a distance away, but he was strong.   Twenty feet above the road, I flew to one side to evade.Grudges.  Even if we had the same enemy, he wasn’t willing to even talk.He threw another bike.  This one was more on-target.  I flew to evade, and saw motion in the corner of my eye.  Nailbiter.Sveta grabbed my arm, tugged, but with my flight not moving me in that same direction, there was a moment’s lag.  Nailbiter’s fingers stabbed at me, and I was forced to throw up the Wretch, forcing Sveta’s hand away.Fingers and motorcycle glanced off of the wretch within a half-second of one another.“Asshole,” I said.“She was mine.  I was dealing with her,” Damsel said.“Shut up,” Beast of Burden said.  “Now.”I flew back and further away.  Byron and Sveta were retreating, cutting through taller grass along the side of a fence.  Nailbiter, though, had a bit of the height advantage.  Even though she didn’t fly, her body was long.  She pointed at them.That was Disjoint and Sidepiece’s indication to go on the offensive.  Beast of Burden trudged back to the road.  Sidepiece dug out a fragment of bone and hurled it like a dart.“Dodge!” I called out.Sveta did.  She pulled herself away, grabbing Byron, and then tugged him away.  It didn’t get him free and clear, and he was at the very periphery.  It looked as though his armor protected him.He blurred and became Tristan.  More confident in a skirmish, maybe.Beast’s clique began advancing through the field, closing the distance.  Damsel joined them.They had only barely finished managing dealing with these Fallen, with our help, and now they were turning on us.  They fully intended to tear through any and all opposition, to be the last ones standing.I wanted to help, but throwing myself into the midst of that group was difficult.  Too many powers, too easy to get hit from multiple angles.I flew for one of the pieces of debris.  A bike engine.  Beast of Burden turned on his heel to keep me in view, and said something to the others, keeping them focused on Tristan and Sveta.I threw the debris, and Beast of Burden slapped it aside before it could hit anything.I’d meant it more as deterrent than anything.Disjoint grabbed Sveta, and I could see her stumble.  Sidepiece prepared to hurl something.It was Chris to the rescue.  I was pretty sure it was him.Black, feathered, and wholly unintuitive in construction.  He had four legs like a crow’s talons, but large and spindly, and his body wrapped in on itself, with thick scale-like plates like the talons that extended around his ‘face’ and front.  The actual features weren’t birdlike, but were nestled in the ‘conch’ of his physical form.  If he’d been a banana, the eyes, mouth, and useful features would have been on the inside curve, the outside curve facing forward.  But he was more of a tight spiral than a banana, confused by the crests and flares of large, glossy black feathers that filled the gaps.It was only because his eyes were spaced out that he could rotate them and look out to the sides, each eye yellow with a distorted pupil.The feathers were heavy and hard, I realized, as he blocked one blast from Sidepiece by rearing up and fanning the feathers out.He stumbled in response to the explosion, then dipped back and into the field of wooden racks and greenery.  Beans, it might have been.Dark Introspection, he’d called this, if I remembered right.The addition of an unknown player gave them pause.  It was our opportunity to back off.  Beast of Burden’s group gathered together.“I would have had her,” Damsel said.“Will you shut up?”“You’re strong but slow,” she said.  “You lack grace, and you need mobility to deal with mobility.”“Enough.”I could see the others getting together.I could also see that the Fallen were gathering.Snag had said he outnumbered these guys?  It didn’t look that way.  I could see Love Lost and a few others.  Cleat.  Etna.  There were a few mooks, rounding out their number to ten or so, but not many with powers that I also recognized.They were backing away from a larger group of Fallen, twenty-strong.  More young Fallen with cheap masks, less in the way of tattoos.Their leader wasn’t like that.  He had an aura to him.  As dark and grungy as the others were, as cheap as many of their costumes were, their skin cluttered with tattoos, he was all in white.  White hair, white mask of overlapping segments with no eyes and black lipstick across the feminine mouth, white tunic, white leggings, white cane.Valefor.  He’d attacked my hometown.He’d be leadership, or he’d be up there.  He had that pedigree.The plan had been to evacuate people, knowing they’d go back.  I’d come to terms with that.  But the hope, the focus, was that we’d deal with the leaders.  If we could deal with the Fallen capes and the lieutenants who were willing to go to war, maybe we could break the back of the larger group, leaving them aimless.  Maybe some of those aimless people would find their way back to society.Twenty of them, and if there were unpowered in there, they were gussied up like the ones with powers, confusing things sufficiently that we couldn’t discount them at all.Fuck me if this wasn’t about to be one heck of an uphill battle.                                                                                        Shadow – 5.10                                                                                        “Valefor,” I said, just loud enough for the others, Damsel included, to hear.  “Hypnotist Master.  I wrote about him in the document.  Don’t look him in the eyes.”Chris was in his bird-spiral Dark Introspection form, and he curled up further, eyes nestling in deep, so his eye only barely peered out.We backed up as the Fallen advanced as a crowd.  Chris prowled around behind us on long, black, bird limbs, his eye peering over our heads.  the pupil resembled a human face in shape, but more a cross-section of the middle of the face.I wished I’d asked for more details on just how his forms functioned.  He might not have answered me, but on the off chance that he did, I’d have some sense of what we could do to defend ourselves.  I just knew it was maybe a solution of sorts in the face of Mama Mathers, the anti-thinker measure, her family, or some combination thereof.Crises tended to highlight things.  They brought out the best and worst of us, whether it was courage in the face of danger to our loved ones or craven behavior in the midst of desperation.  They showed us who our friends were and how much they cared.  I was getting a sense of things I really needed and wanted to work on with these guys, and where our strengths as a team were.  Case in point: I needed to figure things out with Chris.I’d never really had to think about it.  I’d grown up with my first team, and I’d known them intimately by default.  They had been there by default, up until a crisis bad enough it had broken us.“You wanna piece of me!?” Sidepiece screamed out the words.  She put too much pitch in the higher sounds, and managed to get some vocal fry in the mix.“You’ve got to stop saying that,” Disjoint said.Love Lost wasn’t screaming, and the others in her group weren’t attacking.  Cleat, Etna, they only retreated in our general direction.“You want some of this!?” Sidepiece screeched.“Silence!” Valefor called out.  He pointed his cane in her direction, as he shouted it, and a few people tensed from that action alone.Sidepiece shut her mouth.“If the intrusive twits give each other advice, I think we should listen,” Damsel said.  “Don’t look at him.”Sidepiece shook her head.“She wasn’t looking,” Beast said.“Let’s go,” I said.  I turned to go, hand on Sveta’s shoulder.“Don’t run!” Valefor called out, at the top of his lungs.My stride halted, and I swayed a bit before finding my footing.  Introspection Chris had been quicker to stop, and I bumped into him in the midst of my retreat.“Don’t go anywhere!” he cried out.  His arms were out above his head, as if he shouted it to the heavens.I turned around to look.The others were reacting in a similar way.  Beast of Burden was one of the last to stop moving, and nearby bowled over the teammates that were using him as a human shield.  Sveta lost her balance, tipped over and crashed to the ground, arms paralyzed around her, not moving fast enough to break her fall.Shit.I took off, flying straight for Valefor.  I wasn’t the only person with the same idea.  Nailbiter attacked, fingers stabbing out.One of Valefor’s people said something, distant enough he was barely audible, his hand on Valefor’s shoulder.  Other capes were protecting the group against Nailbiter.  One was producing a plume of red smoke that moved in slow motion.  The claws hit the smoke and stopped like they’d hit inviolable steel.The cane swung out my way.  “Stop.”I canceled my flight, dropping down to the ground.  I took a few steps forward before I could stop.  Our side was twenty or thirty feet behind me, and Valefor was another sixty or seventy feet ahead of me.Nailbiter kept up the offense, bringing her claws back like she’d been hurt by the curling smoke, and then swiped in from the side, trying to catch the group from the other side.  The defending Fallen threw more smoke in the way of the attack, so red it looked like plastic, opaque and moving through the air at a crawl, once it left the Fallen man’s hand.“Attacker,” someone said, hand at Valefor’s shoulder, indicating Nailbiter.Sidepiece joined in.  She didn’t advance or retreat, but darted out to the side, fingers clenched in her guts, ripping something out.“Cease,” Valefor called out.Both Nailbiter and Sidepiece were affected.Nailbiter stopped, then withdrew her fingers.  Breathing hard, Sidepiece held a chunk of what might have been appendix or ovary in her hand, blood dripping freely down her arm and off of her elbow.  More blood flowed from the fresh injury in the roadkill mess that was her gut, over her pelvis and the rise of her low-rise jeans, and splattered onto her sneaker.She dropped the bit at her feet.  It detonated, and she was flung to one side.“Clever, but no.  You lie there, guts girl,” Valefor said.  “Don’t move a muscle.  The rest of you?”Damsel used her power, hurling herself forward.“No powers,” Valefor called out.Damsel stopped.“No weapons, no tools.  None of you.  Stay still and wait.”I hadn’t been looking at him.  I glanced at him, and I could see that his eyes were still covered.The instructions he was getting.  He couldn’t see.  His power worked without him needing to see?  Or had he tapped into another source, replying on a cape that granted vision like Mapwright could get and grant mental images of areas?My heart pounded, and I felt nausea welling up.  The Fallen chuckled.  A few of the young hooligan types cackled and danced around, arms waving as they approached, spreading out.We’d been too tied up with Beast of Burden.  What should have been a brief engagement, taking out the two powerful Fallen and then retreating had become a thing.  Valefor had gotten into earshot, and apparently that was all he needed.I was having trouble thinking straight.  Paralysis seemed to freeze my thoughts as much as it did my body.  I’d dealt with it for two years, being unable to move under my own weight.  The need to move became something fluttery in my chest, which fanned the swell of nausea.It felt like colors were different, as was the clarity of my vision, as if I had someone else’s eyes.  I was acutely aware of the feeling of my clothing on my skin, every breath and how they weren’t measured to the breaths before or after them.No powers, he’d said.  I couldn’t bring myself to fly.  I couldn’t bring the wretch out.  I glanced at Love Lost’s group.  They’d been bound by words in the same way.I looked down and tried to focus.The Fallen closed the distance.  I’d charged in, and that put me front and center.  I got a good look at Valefor as he approached.  There were white feathers in his hair and around his collar.  He bent his head at an angle while talking in a whisper with the person leading him.His companion stopped him a few feet in front of me, thumbs hooked in the slim belt at his waist.“Mama told you to help us,” Valefor said.  “You didn’t.”“We did,” I said, still looking down.  “We got your people to safety and protected them.”“I’ve been told there are Fallen casualties,” Valefor said.“Pazuza and Gel are dead.  Smashed to a pulp.  Jay and Nell,” his companion said.  A guy with a face tattoo visible in the gaps of a ragged head-covering that only let his eyes peer through.  “Some injured.”“Family,” Valefor said, sticking his cane in my direction.  “Don’t lie to me.”The fact that he was talking to me meant that I was off limits for the rest.  The hooligans with demon masks and the darker, more adult Fallen walked past me, toward Beast of Burden and the others.  We were quickly getting surrounded, except surrounded was the wrong word.  We were stones in a river, and the Fallen were the water.“We didn’t kill your people.  We did protect and evacuate some,” I said.  “That’s the truth.”“Evacuated?  Yeah, that’s not a good thing,” he said.  He walked around me, reaching out until he touched my arm.  I flinched a little at the contact.  His fingers traced over the decoration at my shoulder.I felt angry at that.  I was reminded of being in the hospital, of being manhandled by nurses and carers that only wanted to get on with their days.  When you were a certain kind of helpless, people took it as their right or common sense that they got to touch you.“You’re going to help us.  Tell me you understand.”“I understand,” I said, the words escaping my lips, barely audible.“You’re going to help us.  You’re going to serve us.  Tell me you’re going to serve us.”“I’m going to serve you,” I said.Amy.  The thought sprung to mind.  Amy.  Amy.  For two years it had been Amy this, Amy that.  All my thoughts in service to being with her, thinking about her, wanting her.Another compulsion.  Then and now, when I’d hit my limit, frustrated-He reached up to my cheek, and gave it two sharp pats, audible.  “Good.”Anger became indignation, enough to choke me, together with the irregular breathing and the nausea.  My head shook a little, my vision grew dark around the edges, and I teetered slightly.I tipped over the brink, past the point where the use of my power was willful and wanted and at the point where it was something I had to hold back.In surrender rather than intent, I lashed out with fear and self-admiration, and I let the Wretch loose, with Valefor in arm’s reach, in that order.Had it been the other way around, the Wretch might have gotten its hands on the man.  But intimidation took hold, and Valefor was assisted by his manservant, who hauled him back and away.  He sprawled in the grass.The manservant was slower to get back, his attention on helping Valefor.  Compulsion, possibly.  An invisible hand struck him in the arm, and the arm folded backward, wrist slapping against elbow, skin tearing from the blunt impact and the bones cutting him from within.What was the rule I’d set for myself?  Seventy-five percent?  Seventy-five percent of the harm done was fair.I wasn’t sure how to quantify physical harm against the emotional and mental harm done.  Standing where I was, Wretch active, Fallen backing away from me, I was in a fugue, emotions a storm as things I’d been bottling up sought release.Valefor’s distraction had apparently freed people, or served as a kind of punctuation to end his ongoing commands.  I was free, even as the ‘serve’ command lingered in the corner of my mind’s eye.It was like the Amy compulsion, the desire I couldn’t fulfill, painful to think about and unwanted even in its straightforward way.Amy, Amy, Amy.  A wild, repetitive thought.I could keep it in the corner and avoid thinking.  A trap I wouldn’t fall into if I didn’t take a step or clear partisan action.  I wouldn’t help Valefor, but I wouldn’t or couldn’t hurt him either.  I couldn’t speak.I flew up and back to get myself safe.  Neutral.Others were taking advantage.  Capricorn slugged a hooligan that was up in his face, gauntlet to chin.  Nailbiter, Beast of Burden and the others tore into the crowd that had moments ago thought they could pass through our group without incident.Love Lost screamed, aiming the scream more at the Fallen stragglers.  The red smoke Fallen had already thrown some defenses up around Valefor, so the two of them seemed unaffected.Others were caught in the effect, and their demeanor shifted.  Some looked happy in a demented way, others went cold, and it was hard to tell with others, as their costumes and masks covered them up too much.  They charged at Love Lost, and she met them with hands out, claws outstretched.  Cleat was a few paces behind her.Some weren’t getting up.  Sveta.  I could see her looking up at me.  Sidepiece lay where she was.  Others weren’t fighting.  Chris in particular had backed away.  Good.I still felt nauseous.  My skin still crawled.  I was still pissed, but it was bottled-up pissed again.I looked in Prancer’s direction, and saw that he was moving on, heading away from us, not toward.  Some of his people looked back.We were facing the casualties of Beast of Burden’s decision to split apart.  Prancer had to know we were here, with the noises and shouting, he wasn’t that far away, but they’d decided to go.“Stop!” Valefor called out.  “Freeze!  No powers!  No weapons!  No tools!”Again, Beast of Burden was the last one to stop.  I turned to look, and saw Damsel off to one side.  Her arm was limp at her side, and she gripped her forearm with her hand.  Blood ran down to her fingertips.Valefor had affected his allies, too.  There had been a note of emotion in his voice, frustration and a bit of fear.He couldn’t see.  His voice was his control over the situation and he’d momentarily lost it.There had been a time he’d needed eye contact.  Now he used his voice.  The trouble with a voice was that it wasn’t focused.  I could remember the cane, and the way both Nailbiter and Sidepiece had obeyed at the same time, earlier.It worked on someone if they thought they were being referred to.There were mental tricks I imagined someone could do.  It seemed like a noose that could be slipped, especially when he referred to people in the general.  I just wasn’t sure I could do it.“Pagan, stand at ease,” Valefor said.  He tilted his head slightly and said the words like they were a joke.  “Report.”The one the Wretch had hit shifted his weight until he could roll over enough that his knees were under him.  He knelt on the ground, clearly unsteady as he worked his way to his feet as best as he could without his hands.  His good arm cradled the damaged one.  “Two dead.  Ten injured, my best guess.  I’m one of them.  I need help soon.”Two dead.Were those dead on my hands?  I’d created a momentary opening, others had taken advantage of it.What would have happened if we hadn’t been here?  Would there be less lives lost?  Or would some of the dangerous individuals be Valefor’s captive audience?Could I afford to even think about that?  We were- we were caught again.  So long as we could talk and we could hear him, there wasn’t a good way to avoid his effect.“Fallen, you can move,” Valefor said.  “Look for anyone that’s covering their ears.”Fallen that had been paralyzed started movingFear was making it hard to breathe.  Could I use that again?  Another disruption?“Girl with the spikes that I was just talking to.  Calm down.  Don’t try to be clever.”Just like that, my thoughts were dulled, and I found myself going back to the little meditative phrases and mental loops.  Old PRT case numbers, a mantra I’d started to go over once when I’d needed to break a loop of thinking, which had inadvertently become something that calmed me down.We’d been prepared for Valefor as he was, with outdated records and a printout of a wiki page that had been salvaged from someone’s laptop after the slow process began of rebuilding the internet.Case zero was Scion.  He was also, I presumed, the last case.  Case one was the Siberian, technically the one who had first started the case files, as the PRT consolidated old data and tried to get information from other government agencies.  Case two was Behemoth, his rise had incited the creation of the PRT.  The case series had been an excuse to gather data from international agencies, too.  Case three was the lie of the virus, an early claim about the origin of powers, propagated by an early online newsgroup.  Case four was The Player, an early Thinker mastermind who had required some greater cooperation across multiple agencies to root out.  Later on, The Player would be a case-in-point for the formation of Watchdog and its core purpose.  Kenzie’s would-be group.The first cases had inspired things, major functions and interests.  Committees had been formed and those committees had become something.  Even though a whole chunk of the early ones were minor or fabrications in the end, the virus theory included, they’d led to things like a dedicated parahuman science department.Ordered, interesting, familiar.  It was calming, even if I didn’t want to be calm.We’d talked about how to deal with him.  Tricks, techniques.  I’d thought I could use my aura, to try to override or distract.  I’d been right.I’d gotten two Fallen killed and the ensuing fracas had led to roughly half of them being injured.  I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.  The idea of death weighed heavy, even if it looked as if it was Beast of Burden and Nailbiter’s doing.  Violence and death didn’t weigh heavy for them.“Our side matches yours in number.  From what I’ve been told, you’re divided, fighting among yourselves.  We aren’t.  The strength of faith,” Valefor said.  He said it almost ironically.  “Let’s tip the scales.  You’re going to serve us.  You’re going to fight for us.  I’ll talk to you one by one and I’ll have you pledge allegiance, starting with-”I heard Damsel’s power, brief.Beast of Burden said something, his voice a growl.“I said not to be clever,” Valefor said.  He drew in a deep breath, then tilted his head as far to the left as it would go, where ear would have been touching shoulder if his mask didn’t cover it.  “Do you want to see what I can do if I get creative?  Someone assist me.”A Fallen woman near him hurried to his side, supporting and guiding him.  She had her tits out, and every inch of her was caked in goopy black paint, which obscured her features and hid details.  Where her lips parted, the paint had cracked, so there was only a broken hard ridge, with lips, teeth and tongue behind.  It even caked her hair.It didn’t look like a Tempera sort of thing.  Just costume.They navigated the crowd, Fallen moving out of their way, our guys and the violent capes frozen in place.Valefor was far enough away from me that I could barely hear him.  He stood in front of Damsel.Her power flared.  She stumbled.The woman with Valefor said something.“Stop,” Valefor said.  “Don’t do that again.  Move your hand.”She pulled her hand away from her forearm.  There was a hole where she had dug her thumb in under the skin.We’d talked about this, but not- not quite like this.“You-” Valefor started.The power flared again.  She stumbled, spell broken, and then brought her good hand around, toward Valefor.The woman in black paint let go of Valefor and caught Damsel’s wrist, forcing it upward.  The power shot well over their heads, and Damsel fell.“Cease,” Valefor said.  “Let’s distract you.  Kill your friends.”Damsel wheeled around, turning toward Nailbiter and Sidepiece.  Then she hesitated, looking up at me.The woman in black paint moved, lunging to intercept another attacker.Chris, leaping in.  The woman in black kept him from getting his talons on Valefor.  He was a spiral twist of feather and scaly talonflesh, with eyes and hard ridges in the mix.  His spindly talons raked and grabbed, but the woman in black was fast, strong, and possibly a precog.He’d picked this form with Masters in mind.  Capes that controlled people.  He hadn’t been willing to say just how or why it helped, only that he was unsure how well it would work.At the time, I’d told myself he’d be kept back and out of the way, so it barely mattered, especially if we couldn’t be certain how reliable it was.Chris got two of his four talons on Damsel, and he tossed her.  She used her power while mid-air, and landed roughly on her feet, one hand touching the ground.  Her injured arm hung limp.The arm sparked and she fell.Fallen pushed past our people to help Valefor, as Introspection Chris tried to reach around the woman in black and scratch him.  Powers came to bear: red smoke, a snake that looked like it was made of intestine and barbed wire, sprouting spikes that crackled with electricity- Introspection Chris disengaged and leaped back as the Fallen came rushing at him.Him was really a quirky word to use when he had this form.There were two with enhanced speed, and the barbed intestine snake had reach.  He wasn’t that fast in this form, even if he was faster than a normal human might have been.  The speedy Fallen tackled him.  The snake caught his leg.I flew a little closer, unconsciously, wanting to keep an eye on things, make sure he was okay.  Mrs. Yamada had charged me with their care.The two Fallen with enhanced speed looked related.  They sped up, but as they did, their bodies deformed.  Legs bent the wrong way, operating digitigrade, the tops of their heads twisted, until their lower jaws pointed the opposite directions that their upper jaws, noses, and eyes did.From the way he reacted to their hits, they hit hard too.  Strength, speed, but at a cost to fluidity of motion, steadily increasing clumsiness and facility.He shook them, and the first fell, the second slipping and the getting a hold of one taloned foot.  Fallen advanced on Chris as a larger group.The two awkward Fallen speedsters were bleeding, I saw.Just as the group seemed poised to go after him, I pushed out with my aura, hard.Heads turned.I hadn’t even meant to.  It was instinct, and it was instinct on behalf of Chris.  I didn’t even care that much about Chris.The act on his behalf brought the pledge to Valefor to mind.  I’d promised to serve, and it was a loop in my thoughts now.  The usual techniques didn’t help to break it.It was a peculiar battlefield, so many people frozen in place, the combatants on the Fallen side not wanting to break the spell by jarring anyone too much.  I hadn’t experienced it myself, but it seemed that if people were told to stop, and were set to moving by a stumble or a push, that was enough that it needed to be renewed.Damsel had broken her prosthetic hand to make her power spark, each stumble forcing a renewal.  Now she stalked toward the group.  Her last order had been to kill her friends.Thought process:  I needed to help Valefor.  I needed to help the others.  I couldn’t break the mental loop and I couldn’t remain neutral anymore, now that the thought was heavy in my mind’s eye.  I would help Valefor.I flew to Valefor, while everyone’s attention was on Chris.  Fallen turned, the woman in black first among them, skin red and sunburned beneath the cracked black paint.  There were veins of red through the paint that weren’t sunburned skin peeking through, either, and I saw she had horns, now that I was closer.I brought the Wretch forth as she lunged for me.The Wretch was invisible, and she had planned her punch and tackle to hit me, not a force a few feet in front of me.  She bounced away, and the Wretch disappeared.  Others were so distracted with Chris and now Beast of Burden, who had been jostled in the fighting, they didn’t even seem to notice.I collided with Valefor fairly hard as I put my arms around him.  He couldn’t see me coming, so he couldn’t even brace against the impact.  I would help him in such a way that he couldn’t tell me to stop helping and put himself in danger again.Collecting him, I flew away from the scene.I would help and serve him.  That was the idea he’d planted in my head.Before he could catch his breath from the impact, I flew in a spiral tight enough his legs went out to the side, and then gently deposited him on a rooftop.I flew away before he could catch his footing, get a lungful of air, and give me another command.The compulsion wasn’t gone.  It was there.But it had abated.  I’d served the rule, but not the spirit.The tide had turned.  The villains that were assisting us were B-listers, but the Fallen weren’t the cream of the Fallen’s crop either.  I flew past the group, jostling people, grabbing them and letting go a moment later.Valefor wouldn’t find his way back in time, I hoped, and the Fallen were already injured from the brief surprise attack.A spray of cold water from Capricorn woke up everyone I hadn’t been able to reach.  The Fallen retreated, the intestine-snake snatching up two and yanking them back.  I did much the same in finding Sveta lying in tall grass, her suit and wig without a head beneath.  A knife impaled her back but hadn’t penetrated the shell.  I carried her away, feeling the reassuring thump of her presence within.“You okay?” I asked, once we were in the air.“Embarrassed,” Sveta said, her voice sounding a bit like it came from the depths of a well.“Okay,” I said.  I landed a distance away, just far enough away we could keep Beast and Damsel’s group of capes in sight.Once four-legged, now three-legged, Chris limped his way to us.  He breathed hard and curled up tight.  Byron followed.“Hey guy,” I said.  I wished we had a name for him.  “Mr. Introspection.  You’re missing a leg.  You okay?”He blinked once.I had no idea what that meant.  Go figure, that he wasn’t any more forthcoming when he didn’t seem to have a working mouth.“What did you end up doing?” Byron asked.“Took Valefor away.  He’s still out there,” I said.  “Unfortunately.”I eyed Damsel, who was at the periphery of Beast of Burden’s group.  There was a dark look in her eye as she talked to that group, clearly heated and I wasn’t there to talk her down.“Tristan couldn’t switch to me, I don’t think,” Byron said.  “When we were talking about capes we might run into last night, we theorized it was a thing we could do, that if he switched to me I might not be compelled, but he didn’t switch.”“It’s okay,” I said.  “We knew there were a half-dozen things we could maybe do, and some worked, some didn’t.”“I hate- I hate losing control.  I only have control over half my life to begin with,” Byron said.“Yeah,” Sveta said.  Her face peered up through the neckhole of her suit.  “There’s- Careful, Victoria.  Or, Byron, can you put your gauntlets over this gap, fasten it when I say so?”“Sure,” Byron said.“Be careful,” Sveta said.She’d undone a clasp at the shoulder.  She brought her head out,  twisting it around in a way a neck couldn’t.  Her tendrils were bound with metal rings into a loose column that disappeared into her suit.  She began working her way into a comfortable position.  “Not having control, it sucks.  Fuck that guy.”“Agreed on both counts, but the lack of control helped us,” I said.  “It’s how I used my aura.  It’s what Damsel did.”Sveta pursed her lips.Damsel was stalking.  Sidepiece and Nailbiter were sticking with her.  Disjoint hung back, talking to Beast of Burden.  Etna, Love Lost, and Cleat seemed to be a sub-clique in that group.Byron blurred.  His armor shifted tints from blue to red.“It’s what Dark Introspection here did,” Tristan said.    “Mind-body disconnect, right?  Looking inward, elective connection.”Chris curled up tighter.“Yeah,” Tristan said.  He bent down to give Chris a pat.  “You’re so weird.”“You did good,” I said.I could see the looks on faces throughout our small group, or what I could see of faces.  Chris being wound together, Sveta looking so deeply unhappy, Tristan’s eyes being narrower.It wasn’t just us.  The violent capes were more agitated.I felt that way.  The panic that had let me tap into the aura and Wretch wasn’t going all the way away.  I wore armor and a costume that made me feel like standing tall and I felt very small.Fuck that guy was right.“What did he tell you?” Tristan asked me.  “Orders, compulsions?”“To serve, to help.  I helped by removing him from a dangerous situation.  I’m not all the way resolved, there.  I don’t want to run into him again.”“Did he tell you to lie?”“Stop that,” Sveta said.  “She would have to say no if he did, so it doesn’t matter.”“Not always,” Tristan said.  “Sometimes you get loopholes.  It’s worth asking.”I shook my head.  “He didn’t tell me to lie.  He was distracted, I think.  He tried to pull a big gambit to turn the tides and he’s operating blind.  Literally, I don’t think he can see.”I still had the traitorous, general thoughts and impressions from the compulsion.  I was familiar with having thoughts that weren’t mine in my head.  The mind was supposed to be sacrosanct, the thoughts it contained purely sourced from oneself and for oneself.  Valefor had violated the former, like Amy had violated the latter.On a level, I was just happy I hadn’t killed him.  I knew there was an argument for why I should have, had I had the opportunity.  I also knew it would have been a betrayal of myself and the me I wanted to be.For all these reasons and more, mind control was another one of the parts of the game.  Too many people found it viscerally horrifying, myself included, and the way things could break down if mind control saw common use was too big of a problem.  The natural reaction from society, or from our sub-society, was to fight back.Valefor obviously didn’t care.He didn’t give me the impression of someone at home in a big thing like the one we’d been in, especially after the fighting had started, and he’d still been pretty damn scary.“We could go,” I said.  “We caught them off guard once or twice there, and we got some lumps in.  It’s not quite breaking the back of the Fallen, but we could pull away, regroup with others, and plan for the perimeter and Looksee’s trap.”“I want to do more,” Sveta said.  “I was useless back there.”“I can’t back down from this,” Tristan-Capricorn said.  “I think if we run into him again, if I’m alert, I might know what to do.”“If you’re sure,” I said.He nodded.I looked down at Introspection Chris.  “How about you?  You good to retreat to the background?  Gallop in if you see the need and feel up to it?”He lurched to his feet, curled and uncurled like he was stretching, and then loped away, swaying a bit to compensate for the missing forelimb.  He bucked a bit, claw reaching up, and then the iffy camouflage kicked in.“Okay,” I said.  “I have a lot of questions.”“His whole thing is he doesn’t like answering them,” Capricorn said.“He’s doing his part,” Sveta said.  “That was brave.”“It was insane,” Capricorn said.  “No offense intended to present company, brothers, or self.”“Fine line between bravery and insanity,” I said.I looked across the clearing to Beast of Burden’s group.  Damsel wasn’t pacing anymore.Capricorn approached and stood next to me, his armored shoulder touching the spikes at mine.  Sveta stood at my other side, looking in that direction.“Do we try this?” Capricorn asked.“We might have to.  I don’t like leaving her alone like this.”“Okay.”Capricorn put a hand up.  Disjoint was watching us, and nudged Beast of Burden.Their group went quiet.I was well aware that Love Lost was a danger to Rain.  I was aware of how dangerous these guys were in general.  Beast of Burden had killed two members of the Fallen’s inner circle, it sounded like.  They’d been people Valefor was close to.We approached, slow and steady.“Can we try this a second time?” Tristan asked.  “Truce?  We deal with this whole situation.  There are hostages we need to rescue and we can’t afford to fight.”“I like the idea,” Disjoint said.“Backup would be awful nice,” Sidepiece said.  She had a really annoying voice.  I’d noticed it earlier.  A bit of the teenage vocal fry, trying a bit to sound cute, but she wasn’t a teenager and I didn’t think she was cute.“Not your call,” Beast of Burden said.“Is it supposed to be yours?” Damsel asked.“You can be quiet,” Beast of Burden said.  “I’ve heard too much from you today.  Earn your stripes first, then talk.”“Hey, Damsel of Distress,” I said.She turned to me.“You good?  Any lingering compulsions?”“No.  I don’t have much goodness to go around, but I don’t have any compulsion either.  I don’t have friends.”“You gave me a look,” Sidepiece said.  She had hair over one side of her face, but she didn’t take very good care of it, and a mask in the same cut as the phantom of the opera one, albeit cruder, covered part of her face.  Black makeup filled her lower eye socket and distorted the impression of her eyeshape.  “A very flattering murderous look.”“I thought about it,” Damsel said, imperious and proud, chin rising a bit.  “I don’t know if you qualify as a friend, when I barely know you, but I don’t mind your company, Sidepiece, and I can respect a lady with the discipline to have a… twelve inch waist?”She smiled a bit.  Her arm sparked, her power ripping between the wound at her forearm and her fingertips.  and she stumbled into Disjoint.  Frowning, she backed away until she was a short distance from everyone else.“Sixteen inches, last I checked, but thank you.  You’re a dear,” Sidepiece said, ignoring the power misfire and maintaining her intentionally frayed voice as she feigned higher class.“Will you help us?” I asked.“No,” Beast of Burden said.Nailbiter and Damsel exchanged a look.  Nailbiter looked over at Sidepiece.“Yes,” Nailbiter said, voice whistling slightly.Beast of Burden wheeled on her, finger pointing.  “Not your choice.”“Democratically?” Sidepiece asked.  “I think most of us want the help, Bob.”“This isn’t a democracy,” Beast of Burden said.  “This is a fucking tyranny.  You signed on for it, and you agreed I’m leader because I’m good for the business and track record.  You also agreed that if the crown is moving to another head, it’s going to do so outside of jobs.  Leaders can’t be second guessed on the field.”“Either we run or we press on,” Damsel said, second guessing him.“Enough,” Beast of Burden said.“If we press on, we’re going to face worse than we just did.  I agree with Sidepiece and Nailbiter.  It makes sense,” Damsel said.Her power sparked again.  She maintained her balance, overcompensated, and stumbled a step the other way.“You okay?” Sveta asked.“Just fine,” Damsel said, curt and sounding anything but.  She turned back to Beast of Burden.  “Don’t be a wuss, Beast.  You look weaker trying to go this alone than you do taking the help.”Before Beast of Burden could reply, Love Lost approached him from behind.  She rapped claws with blood still on them on the back of his armor.He turned.She pointed at Nailbiter, then at us.“She’s the client,” Damsel said.He stabbed a finger her way.  “Last warning.”Her power sparked.  This time she fell.“Good.  Stay like that,” Beast of Burden said.  He stepped forward and placed one iron boot on the edge of her dress.  Damsel remained where she was.  Struggling would have been futile.“Don’t be a dick,” I said.“Don’t interject yourself into our business.  If the client wants help, fine.  We’ll do this.”“We need to find the hostages.  We’ll reunite with another group we’re working with and use their thinkers or other resources.  If there’s a confrontation, we work together,” I said.Beast of Burden shrugged, spreading his gauntlet-clad hands slightly.  He stepped off of Damsel’s dress, and went to walk in the direction the fighting had gone.  It seemed with Prancer mobile and Velvet having some emphasis on enhanced maneuverability when driving with her telekinesis, they were moving around a lot, and the Fallen were giving chase.  They had moved away since the fight with Valefor.Love Lost pointed.  She didn’t spare Damsel a glance as she walked on.  Some of the others joined her.  Nailbiter, Disjoint, and Etna.  Sidepiece lingered as Damsel picked herself up.  Her arm sparked twice, but she didn’t fall.She gave us a look, then stalked away.We cut through the north end of the settlement, toward the northwest corner, and the sound of ongoing confrontation got us jogging after them.  Well, I flew, but the rest jogged or ran.Prancer was engaged.  They were fighting with hit and run tactics, and when the Fallen didn’t take the bait or stopped to pause, Prancer’s group assaulted buildings.  There was a shop on fire, and a large garage with a truck in it that now had a chunk missing.A big part of what let them do that was the heroes at the west end of the settlement, and the presence of the Undersiders.  Bitch and her dogs were standing beside Vista.  Narwhal was close, and two black stuffed animals reared up at the edge of the camp.  Foil was there, but Tattletale was not.No Valefor, but I could see a core group of Fallen with fancier costumes and that kind of presence.Nobody that looked like they could be Mama Mathers, either.The pressure was on, and the Fallen looked to be losing ground.  There were world-class capes lined up against them.  If the actual groups were even in power, and I wasn’t sure they were, then Prancer’s group was playing it in such a way that even if the Fallen won, they wouldn’t have a town left after.My phone buzzed.I pulled it out.Looksee:



Not peeking am reporting what others saying.  Precog with me says Vista says that the hostages you want are toward south end of town.  Map attached.The text had an image attached.I flew skyward, looking.A group.  Valefor’s group, with Fallen civilians and others.  The hostages.We could figure something out.White flickers danced in the corner of my vision.  I looked away, but they persisted.  Like the motes of dust in my eye, but akin to snowflakes.If that was their anti-thinker measure, which might well be Mama Mathers, then even the thinker-esque advantage of having a bird’s eye view was enough to give them an in.I grit my teeth.I’d seen the building Looksee had marked on the map.Dropping out of the sky, I landed beside the group.  “This way.  The-”Turning toward Beast of Burden’s group, I was just in time to see him backhand Damsel across the face.  It was a casual swing, but he was strong and he wore a gauntlet.  She hit the ground hard.“Jesus fuck, no wonder your team is mutinying,” Capricorn said.  “You can’t play nice with others in a crisis?  There’s stuff going on!  Be a professional.”“She didn’t even say anything!  This time!” Sidepiece said, bending down beside Damsel.  Damsel pushed her away.Her damaged hand at her face, the other used to get to her feet, Damsel worked her way to a standing position.  I didn’t see anything resembling Ashley in her eyes.“I gave her a final warning,” Beast of Burden said.“Hey,” Capricorn said.“Damsel,” I said.  “Ashley.”“Stop,” Beast of Burden said, pointing at Damsel, talking over me.One hand still on her face, she pointed at him and blasted before his expression could change.Darkness, shadow, distorted space and visual static ripped through armor, flesh, and armor again, tearing a hole clean through him.  The hole caved in on itself, metal creaking as it bent, blood fountaining out and splashing up on half the people nearby.“You stop,” she said.                                                                                        Shadow – 5.11                                                                                        “Damsel!” Sveta cried out, as the initial shock wore off.Everyone was backing away from Beast of Burden and from Damsel, who caught her footing and looked down at the body.  Sentences were an overlapping jumble.“What did you do?” Disjoint asked, eyes wide.  His mask was a black stick-on sort, but it was divided into two halves, one for the brow and one for the cheekbones.  As his eyebrows went up and his eyes went wide, the two halves separated, revealing red-painted skin beneath.“What I did is obvious,” Damsel said.“Fuck,” Sidepiece said.  She ran her fingers back through the sides of her hair, and there was enough residual fat and blood on them from her using her power that her hair stuck where it was pushed.  “He hadn’t paid me yet.”“Why?” I asked.  “Why did you do this?”“He stepped on me.  He struck me.  In a fight?  That’s fine, you can hit me in a fight.  But like this?  When I’m helping?  I’ll hit back.”“That’s not a hit,” Sveta said.Damsel paced a little.  People were giving Damsel and the blood spatter a wide berth, and as she moved, people backed up more.Nailbiter was on the far side of the group, furthest from me.  She prowled on elongated limbs, silent, staring.Damsel spoke up, “I will not be stepped on.  I will not be beaten down and take it with a smile.  He wanted to be a tyrant but he couldn’t lead.  He didn’t know his own place in things and he thought to tell me mine?”“So he dies?” I asked.“He knew what he was doing,” she said.  “He-”Her power misfired.  She staggered a bit, and Capricorn and Sveta backed away more.  Damsel found her balance, but when she did, her hair draped down in front of most of her face, and she let it hang there.She continued, “He knew the risks when he went toe to toe with me.  When he struck me, it wasn’t heated.  It was cold, logical.  He knew if he didn’t do something, he’d lose his team.  He calculated the risk and he calculated it wrong.”“You pushed him to that point,” I said.Sveta touched my arm.  Fear that I was provoking Damsel when she was in a dangerous state?  Or because I sounded accusatory?  Both?“I calculated wrong, I thought he was smarter.”She said.  She stuck out a foot, and rested her foot on Beast of Burden’s forehead.  His helmet had tipped back by its own weight, exposing a face with narrow eyes, and a muttonchop beard.  His head was resting on the part of the helmet that had once been behind his neck.  She moved his head around by moving her foot.“Stop that, please,” Sveta said.Damsel paused.Sveta pointed at the foot.  “Please.  Even if he wasn’t a great person, he was human.  He deserves common decency.”Damsel stepped back, placing her footsteps where there wasn’t too much blood.  There was a dusty print on Beast of Burden’s forehead now, with some small rocks settled into the corner of his eye, by the bridge of his nose.“Thank you,” Sveta said.In the background, lights danced around the shadows of the trees at the west edge of the settlement.  Vista and Weld’s group.  It caught Sveta’s attention, and I saw her focus her balance, swaying slightly less.  I could imagine it as a tension in the tendrils within her body.On the other side of things, while everyone else turned to look at the shifting reds and blues and greens, my focus was on Ashley.  I saw something in her expression, as she looked at Sveta, then at Capricorn, and finally met my eyes.  It was fleeting, spooked, more like how an ordinary person might look if they were at the mercy of ex-Slaughterhouse Nine member Damsel of Distress, than Damsel of Distress herself.Hardly the imperious bearing she had a moment ago.I saw the expression pass before any of the members of the other group could react.  Love Lost tilted her head a little, walking around the periphery of the larger group- a wide periphery, given how we’d spread out and backed off.“This is the true world of parahumans,” Damsel said, turning to look at Love Lost.  Damsel’s chin rose a little, as she went back to being the villain queen.  “The other things fall away, but this remains a constant.  It’s why we all die young.”“Endbringers and end of the world helped,” Sidepiece said.“The end of the world never stopped,” Damsel said.  “This is it, continuing, wearing demon masks and cheering about fucking over the rest of us.  It’s wearing stupid helmets with horns as long as my legs and thinking it can find its way to power by killing its enemies and stepping on anyone in its way.”“It’s blasting a hole in someone with a stupid helmet,” Disjoint said.She turned on him.  He stepped back some more.“Don’t blast a hole in the guy with the stupid limb teleporting power,” he said.She started to talk, then stopped as her power misfired again.  She gripped her arm, pressing down on the hole where she’d dug her thumb in.  I assumed it was the point where her arm stopped and the prosthetic started, interrupting the connection.I was lost.  She’d always been tricky to deal with, but I’d mostly had a good sense of what made her tick.  I’d been able to talk her down a few times, I knew what she liked and what she wanted.I didn’t know, here.“Fuck me,” Capricorn said.  “I don’t know what to say.  This needs to be answered, but there are people with lives on the line right now.”“Go,” she said.  “You guys seem to be good enough at finding us and showing up at inconvenient times.”Capricorn shook his head.  “Fuck this,” he said.  Angrier, he said, “This isn’t over.”“No,” Damsel said, her chin rising a bit more.  “I didn’t think it was.”“This isn’t good,” Sveta said.  “This is pretty far from okay.”“I’ve always been a long way off from good and okay,” Damsel said.“That’s not an excuse to turn your back on those things.”“Oh fuck off, you sanctimonious cyborg,” Sidepiece said.“Clearly not a cyborg,” Damsel said.“I’m- yeah.  Not a cyborg.  And I’m fucking off, don’t worry.  People to help.  Damsel of Distress?”“Fuck offff,” Sidepiece said, head lolling back.  She stopped as Damsel raised a hand.“What?”  Damsel asked.“Help yourself so others can help you,” Sveta said.Sveta and Capricorn were ready to go.  I hesitated.Everything kept coming back to the same scenarios, moments, and scenes.  There were parallels, comparisons, things about people I noticed.A therapist I’d talked to while Mrs. Yamada was away had explained it to me as a consequence of trauma.  Some things were just so big in our own heads that they had their own gravity.  They demanded to be dwelt on and they leveraged that dwelling to tie everything back into themselves, every detail they invoked and every question they raised.  They were impossible to figure out but we had to try, and that trying became more leverage.She was fundamentally broken as a person.  I didn’t know a lot but I knew that, standing here and seeing her standing over a dead body.  I’d been there, I’d been a witness, and I’d been galled then too.  I’d witnessed a breakdown of someone extremely dangerous.I one hundred and fifty percent understood Capricorn and Sveta’s reactions.Those who had their trauma get too big were the types to extend it to everything.  A bad event became a fear of the world, or of men, of capes, or it became self-loathing that permeated every part of one’s own being.The remedy was to talk to someone, to get perspective.  Complicated by the fact that sometimes people weren’t equipped to understand or to listen.I stared at Ashley and the villains who stood around her.  They hadn’t rejected her outright.  Love Lost, Cleat, Disjoint, Sidepiece, Nailbiter.They weren’t equipped.  Just the opposite.“I’d like you to turn yourself in, and submit yourself into our custody,” I said.Her eyes widened slightly.“There it is,” Nailbiter said, in that eerie voice with its whistles and hisses of breath through teeth.“There what is?” Sidepiece asked.“Our hooded girl here called Damsel by her real name.”“There’s a history,” I said, at nearly the same time as Damsel said, “History.”“Uh huh,” Nailbiter said, disbelieving.  “The timing’s off.  When these guys showed up.  When you did.”Damsel spoke without taking her eyes off me, “She probably came after me.  I fought her family in Boston.  My second trip, a while later, I fought her boss in the Protectorate.”“Not my boss,” I said.“No?”“I wasn’t a Ward for long, and he wasn’t in charge at the time.”Damsel shrugged, very easily and casually, as if she wasn’t standing over the body of the man she’d murdered.“I’ve fought your family, and we’ve had run-ins,” she said.  “Bonesaw, who brought me back from the dead, fucked up her sister and attacked her family in their home.”“Don’t go there,” I said.She raised her hands in a ‘I give up’ kind of way.  Her power arced around the one, an aimless stream shooting off skyward at an angle before fizzling out.“Come into custody, we’ll take you with us, we’ll have you stand down and stay off to the side until this whole thing wraps up,” I said.  “I know you’ve benefited a lot from the amnesty.  There are people you talk to and people who help you maintain a normal life.  If you walk away from this scene, that ends.”“Holy shit, heroes are annoying,” Sidepiece said.  “Let’s go.  I’ve got a bingo sheet to fill out, and I’ve gotta land a direct hit with a bit of uterus or set off a combo explosion with a spleen toss if I want to clear a row.”She approached Ashley, reaching out.  Nailbiter barred her way.Was it worth it?  The ruse didn’t matter anymore, we weren’t going to keep her in this role.  Like so many things, she’d been great when the going was good.  When things got rougher- we needed to figure something out later.It only mattered in that if we didn’t end up taking her away from this and revealed her role, she’d end up in danger.“If you come, Damsel, I can’t promise there won’t be consequences, but I’ll testify about circumstances.  It’s a chaotic situation with Valefor as a factor, and everything else.  They’re mitigating factors.  Protect the amnesty, here.”I saw her start to lift her foot from the ground.  Her power flared, and she bent over at the waist, catching one knee with her good hand.  It wouldn’t have been enough to catch her balance entirely, but Nailbiter had draped fingers along the one side.Damsel put a hand on Nailbiter’s finger to steady herself as she straightened.“You have people to help,” she said.  She pushed at Nailbiter’s finger.  “And I’m done with this.  I’m going to get my arm fixed before I start killing everyone I see out of pure frustration.”“Good plan,” Disjoint said.Will you confess?  I wanted to ask.  Will you tell someone?I couldn’t ask it out loud, because there was no answer she could give that would suffice for all parties involved.Leaving wasn’t as good as her staying in our sight, but it was better than staying with this bunch.Sveta and Capricorn were making their careful way toward Valefor, moving slowly for my sake, and to keep an eye on my exchange with Damsel.  I flew to them, and they started moving faster as I joined the group again.There was still the situation further into the settlement proper.“She’s walking away,” I said.  “Best we can get.”“I didn’t know it would be that hair-trigger,” Capricorn said.“I figured it was,” another voice said.We stopped.  Tristan summoned some orange motes around his hand.  Sveta brought up one hand, holding her forearm.The terrain moved.  It was the camouflage blur that was Chris, except the effect I’d seen was patchy and inconsistent, and Chris was almost seamlessly fitting into the environment.  The form was mostly faded, but I could see the spikes and ridges that were feathers.“I must be the only person who wasn’t surprised by that,” Chris added.“How the hell did you get that good with the camouflage?” Tristan asked.”“Staying still helps.  Being a genius helps too,” he said.  He made a dry cackling noise.  “Not that I’m a genius, exactly.  I’m good at getting into the mindset and physical form that makes me good at doing something.”“And being a weird spiral bird helps with camouflage how?” Capricorn asked.  He edged closer to the corner of a building, trying to get a peek of the situation.”“The introspection-self-reflection-reflection-grief wing of things?  Great for self awareness, which is great for knowing just how I’m positioned and how I look.  Don’t spend too long looking, Capricorn.  They’ve got a fucky-”I saw the camouflage distort as he brought his hands to his head.“-power,” he said.I thought about the visual ‘snow’ and it flared back into existence at the lower right corner of my eye.“The anti-thinker measure,” I said.“Yeah.  Guess so.  One of the Fallen with the hostages.  Valefor’s there.  My Dark Introspection form disconnects mind from body, which is great if I want to put my body on autopilot or leave it with instinctive actions, but it doesn’t stop my mind from being fucked with.”“You shouldn’t be this close to things,” I said.“Well, I am.  I did stuff while you guys were running around.  I get fucked up when I do the deep self-dive with that form, so I told my body what to do and interjected a few times with new input.  I think I’m having a good day, my body definitely was, but it’s hard to tell with the emotional aftertaste.”“A good day?” Sveta asked.“Yeah,” Chris said, with a note of something that might have been incredulity, or even curious emphasis.  “This is why I’m in the game.  Running with the big guys, dealing with the big things.  Lives on the line.”“You’re a kid,” Capricorn said.“Right now?  I’m halfway toward being a freaky personification of Dark Introspection and being a pink skinned scoundrel.  We’re all special cases, Cap.  Ashley snapping should drive that home, if your daily schedule hadn’t already.”Sveta looked back in Ashley’s direction.“You’re talking a lot,” I said.“I’m desperately trying to ride an excited high here, because the alternative is slipping into Introspection or dealing with the fact some power is trying to drive me nuts.  Work with me.”“I’ll try,” I said.I wanted to sound more confident and authoritative, but- I didn’t like how we’d left Ashley, or how we’d let that happen.  That was something that weighed on me, and the melancholy I’d noted earlier in the day was giving way to something that riffed on the panic I’d experienced with Valefor.Except the hints of panic I felt wasn’t about one situation with Valefor, or even about this greater conflict.  It was about big picture stuff, and one impulse call by Ashley had brought the big-picture concern into focus.  I knew she’d called it calculated, not impulse, but I couldn’t see how it could be.I wanted things to be better and right now, they weren’t.But I needed to focus.  I needed to work with these guys, like Chris had said.I glanced at Sveta, and she looked just about as lost as I felt.I reached for her hand and gave it a waggle.“Hostages,” I said.  “We want to deal with Valefor too.”“I prepared another form in case we needed to fight,” Chris said.  “It’s slow.”“Vigilance,” Capricorn said.“Yeah.”“Save it.”“Fourteen hostages, by the way.  There are five Fallen, one Valefor, two people from the Clans, and someone who might be the guy in charge of the bikers.  I spent a while looking, and I’m seeing ghosts now, I think.”“Not good that that’s a thing,” Capricorn said, “But this is good to know.”He extended a hand down toward Chris, who was still camouflaged, albeit less tidily than before.  He straightened, moving his arm like he was pulling Chris to his feet.“Fuck,” Chris hissed.  Things clattered to the dirt around him.  Some were camouflaged.  Others were containers.  “I thought you were shaking my hand or something.”“What is that?” I asked.“Food.  Because I need to fuel up, and my next form is dense.  Some meds.  Plus my walkman and pocket atari, and some other stuff.  I was sorting out my stuff after getting dressed again.”“Walkman?” Capricorn asked.“We’re post-end of the world, I’m not going to bring my phone and risk it getting broken or losing it and having someone use it to figure out my secret identity.  Fuck, it’s hard to see it now that it’s not on me.”“You can’t bring all this stuff,” Capricorn said.“Fuck off,” Chris replied.  “I do things how I do them.”Capricorn sighed faintly and bent down to help.  I took Capricorn’s spot at the corner of the building, peering carefully around.Chris protested, barely audible but clearly pissed.  “No, don’t help.  You’re just moving it around, and it’s hard enough to keep track of things when holes are appearing in everything.”“Holes?” Capricorn asked.“Holes.  Flesh with holes in it like it’s rotting, but round, fleshy, and damp, ground with pockmarks, walls with more holes, and-” his voice became slightly higher pitched as the intensity of them ratcheted up, “Things are looking at me or wriggling on the other side of the holes.  It’s not the coolest!  I’m trying not to think about it!”“Shh,” I said.They stopped talking, but Chris continued to rummage and rustle, and Capricorn stood back, arms folded.Conversation continued in the distance, as the people managing the hostages talked.  I could peer around the corner and past a tree to see a slice of things between two buildings, but it wasn’t much.  I didn’t want to move too much and alert anyone.“Problem?” Sveta asked.“I wanted to see if I could overhear anything.  Chris is seeing things, why aren’t they affected?  Is it selective?”“I couldn’t tell you,” she said.“I’m going around,” Sveta said.  She swayed a little and touched the wall with one hand to steady herself.“Okay.  Be careful.  Don’t let them affect you like they did Chris.”She extended her arms out, reaching out with tendrils that had the arms at the ends to hamper them and weigh them down, then pulled herself away with less noise than Chris made as he packed up his stuff.The Fallen settlement was wedged in between a ‘v’ of forest, with the road cutting in from the east.  The settlement proper was a denser cluster of rustic buildings, and houses dispersed out into the wider area, thinning out the further they were from this settlement.I had the impression that this was the city center.  The main road cut through the cluster of buildings, about two houses down from where I was, and it seemed to do so with a weird angled turn in it.  It made me think these buildings had been some of the first, and the road had been an afterthought.The hostages, from what I’d seen from my bird’s eye view, were being made to sit in the road, corralled by a group of people with powers.  Valefor among them.I ventured further along, checking the coast was clear, then skip-flying over to the next vantage point by pushing off the ground with my foot and flying from there once airborne.  The buildings remained dense between myself and the Fallen.Sveta dropped down from above me, scuffing the wall as she did.  It seemed intentional, to keep me from startling too much or lashing out in anticipation of an attack.She pressed her fingers to my mouth.  Leaning in close, she murmured in my ear, “Two to your left.  Two to our right.  They were told where we are.  About twenty feet away.”I nodded.She pulled away and turned to one side.  I turned to the other, so my back was almost touching hers.My instinct was to go up.  I flew, and at roughly the same moment, Sveta went low, torso almost flat against the ground, and she pulled herself in the direction of Capricorn and Chris.I brought myself up to the roof level, and navigated the rooftops while using them as cover from anyone on the street.Gunfire in the distance was met with more gunfire.  Prancer, Velvet, Moose, Narwhal, Weld, and Vista, with some of the Undersiders.My heart pounded.  I moved with only light contact using toes and fingertips to guide myself as I stayed as close as I could to the rooftop while not putting any weight on it.I saw them.  A man and a woman.  He was wearing a costume with ragged black leather enveloping most of him, and a round metal mask surrounded by leather that obscured the shape of his head.  The skin of his arms was tanned with arm-hairs sun-bleached.  His visible skin was dripping with sweat.  It wasn’t that hot a day out, with the sun hidden behind the clouds but that much leather had to be intense.The woman was Fallen.  Her mask inverted her face, so she peered through the mouth-hole, and horns swept out from the top and bottom corners, for four in total.  She’d dressed lightly enough she had to have been cold, with a strapless top bound to her body by thin chains.  More chains wrapped around the red cloth wraps that encircled her forearms, pelvis, and legs.As I looked down from above, I could see that she was touching the wall as she walked by it, leaving a trail of what looked like gaseous glass.  It formed edged, hooked shapes as she left it behind.I flew a course intended to take me behind them, so I could do something quick and decisive.Yellow lights flared along the length of the glass, gaseous smoke.  Eyes.The smoke billowed out, taking on a more solid form as it became a nebulous mass of teeth, barbs, claws, and razor edges.I raised my forcefield and smashed it.My forcefield won, but only barely.  The beast-smoke I hit broke into solid chunks, some as large as my head.The woman- I turned to look and saw her creating more smoke as something that billowed toward me in a wave.  I backed away until my forcefield was up, then crashed into it, hard.  I saw her stumble back, arms around her face.Behind her, the guy with the circular mask had four lenses spaced evenly around the mask flare with energy.  Four shapes manifested in front of him- long and slim, round, thicker crescent, and a star-like shape with radial spokes.I pushed out with my aura before he could do anything.  The woman stumbled and landed on her ass.  The guy weathered it, paused, and then touched the long, slim one.The other three images disappeared, but the one he’d touched flew at me like a javelin.  I threw myself to one side, but it wasn’t even aimed at me.It flared with a dark amber light as it embedded into the wall, then faded.  I put some distance between myself and it.The woman created more smoke, sending it down the side-street in a wave that grazed buildings on both sides.  I flew up and away.I pushed out with my aura, and it failed.  Like a car failing to start, it sputtered and died out.  On my second try, it did work, but it felt weak.Power dampener.My flight felt fine.  The wretch, unfortunate as it was, felt okay too.Was it because my awe power was the one I’d been using?The woman with the glass smoke sent a column skyward.  As I flew back and away, I could see it expanding out into the air.  More demon imagery ran through it, all the overlapping chaos of hell, snapping jaws, and ripping claws.The guy was creating another diagram.  Three images remained, now.Yeah.  This group that was with the hostages was important, if they had people like this as bodyguards and errand-runners.I flew away from them, trying to get a sense of how vulnerable Valefor’s group was.  I was aware he’d gotten some hooks in me earlier, but I wasn’t feeling it as much.  I wasn’t sure if the emotional shock of Ashley had shaken me of some of it, or if it was subtle in a scary way.I saw another glowing object pass through two walls and part of a short fence before hitting the ground twenty feet below me and twenty more feet to my right.It detonated with the impact, expanding out into the space around it, getting thinner as it did.The moment I realized it was expanding at a rate that would catch up with me, I flew toward the ground, away from the bubble.My flight sputtered out, maneuvering dying, speed cutting out, and the entire thing threatening to just give up on me altogether.I landed hard, with a grunt.Explosion bomb, javelin dart, and two more, and my flight and aura were both in tatters.I could at least reassure myself that these things didn’t tend to be permanent unless they were power theft.  Powers wanted to be used, and submitting to a power-canceling effect on a permanent basis didn’t make sense.A mixed feeling, when I thought about the Wretch being permanently removed.Now it was more or less all I had.  I could hear the smoke creatures.  I could see the spire that had been sent skyward, that now was a rigid pillar.  After they attacked, they seemed to solidify into solid fixtures.“Work with me,” I whispered.I brought out the Wretch, and I hit the nearest building, shattering the wood exterior.I remained where I was, feeling that fluttery panic feeling again, tinged with the heavy feeling that always came with the Wretch.  I used the moment to retrieve my metal mask and don it.I reached out in the direction of the shattered wood, and I grabbed one lengthy piece.  “Arm yourself,” I said, my voice muffled by the mask.The wretch reached out for other chunks of the wall.  It bit into them, drummed them with impacts that made the whole building complain, and shredded solid struts with fingernails, punches, and kicks.I canceled the field, then brought it out again.  I seized another long bit of wood, a supporting beam, and hauled on it.  The Wretch hit it, and broke it at the base.  I stumbled as it came free.One-handed, using only my regular strength, I tossed the three feet of two-by-four up.The Wretch caught it.They were getting closer.  I could hear them.My heart sank as the Wretch gripped the two-by-four so hard it splintered and broke at the middle.“Use it as a weapon,” I said.There was no indication the Wretch heard.The pair were making their approach.  The guy had one glowing circle on his mask, now, and a crescent moon of manifested power-canceling energy that he held like a sword.The smoke woman unleashed her power on me.  I charged in, crashing into it, and shattered the first ten feet.The Wretch threw the two feet of two-by-four, or it let go of the piece as it dissipated.The block of wood hit the masked woman in the face hard enough to knock her off of her feet and break the horn at the right side of her her chin.  The smoke ceased flowing, and the forms went still.I’d hoped it would use the weapon to break stuff before it broke down in turn.I watched as she tried to get to her feet, stumbled, and then fell back down again.  On her second attempt, she created two columns of her power, letting them solidify, before using them as leverage to stand.  She slumped against one, then slowly slumped back down toward the ground.That left me to deal with the guy who could disrupt powers with his arsenal of minor abilities.  Right.He went to the girl first, still holding his blade, and bent down by her.“She okay?” I asked.He didn’t respond.  Slowly, he helped her get to her feet.In the same instant, the two of them looked off to one side, as if they’d heard a loud noise.He dismissed the sword, one of his eyes lighting up, then drew out the star thing.He cast it down at the ground, hard.  He and the girl disappeared.The direction they’d been looking.  The Fallen that had been watching the hostages.I ran after them, trying flight when I could.  It took a few running steps before I had something that was better than legging it.Capricorn and Sveta had arrived.  That was the only thing I could see as a more or less unambiguous plus.There was a group on the scene, facing down Valefor and the other Fallen, with the power nullifier and glass-smoke woman having already rejoined them by teleport.  A woman with a bunny mask and marching band outfit, ears poking up through the brim of the flat-top, feathered cap.  There were three people in costumes that I didn’t recognize, and there was Rain, with the metal mask, gloves, and dark hood.  He was tense, and he was tense for damn good reason.Their arrival had precipitated something I’d seen as more or less inevitable.  With as many players in this game as there were, the hostages were always going to be the last card the Fallen group could play, so a part of me had trusted and hoped that they would hold off on playing it.Something Rain or this mystery group had done had spooked them enough that they’d played the card.The battlefield was the dirt road that cut an odd angle through the settlement center.  On that dirt, Erin was among the hostages that writhed and screamed as they lost their minds.                                                                                        Shadow – 5.12                                                                                        Against a backdrop of screaming and writhing, with clouds rolling across the overcast sky, and both dust clouds and smoke rolling over the ground, the three assembled groups were very still and careful.“Stop it,” Rain called out.  “Leave them alone.”“Can’t,” Valefor said.  “She isn’t here.  But if she sees you stand down, this might end.”There were kids in that group of writhing individuals.  There was an old man with the lines in his neck standing out taut, teeth bared and clenched together.“I can’t stand down,” Rain said.  “Reversing the protection takes time and effort to undo.”“Then this is your righteous punishment,” Valefor said.  As he started talking, I brought my hands up near my ears.My powers were still wonky.  I could tell.  My flight and aura didn’t feel readily available.Beside me, Capricorn had morphed.  From Tristan to Byron.The Fallen guy I’d just been fighting said something low and under his breath, to Valefor.“No.  The immunity isn’t him,” Valefor said.  “Not if the rest of them are the same.  Someone helped.”Capricorn had changed again.  Back to Tristan.  He walked a little, moving away from me.  What were they doing?The woman with the bunny mask walked, almost strutted around the periphery of things, her rapier in hand.  The capes with Valefor kept their attention on her, while Valefor was oblivous or uncaring.“We’ve got other capes showing up, Valefor,” a Fallen soldier said.  Young, and possibly powered.  I wasn’t sure if I could read too much into costumes or outfits when unpowered and powered were so diverse, but if I was going to, I’d assume powers for the ones who had more identity to their costumes, with confidence rather than conformity in the designs.  This guy had bright colors and a hard mask that wrapped around the top and sides of his head.  It was made such that it looked like it had been nailed on, with blood, old and fresh, seeping out from the points the nails went in.“The ones we fought earlier,” the one with the round mask said.  The round plate of a mask with four eyeholes cut into the hard was an identity of its own.  It stood out.  I knew there were powers there, already.  He supported the woman with the four-horned mask and red wrappings.Those two aside, there were six other Fallen that kept Valefor company.  Nine in total.“Team,” Rain called out, raising his voice to be heard over the screams.  “There’s one Fallen that isn’t here.  Mama Mathers.  She’s close.  You can’t look at her without her infecting your mind.  Her voice and touch does the same thing, but gives her other avenues of attack.  Mentioning her gives her a big opening, it’s why I couldn’t say anything earlier.”Well, that cleared up something that had been plaguing the good guys for a long time.“I saw a glimpse of her,” I said.“You see things?” he called out.“Yeah.  Some.  She got our Changer worse.  He seems to be dealing alright, though.”“He’s enduring because he’s weird,” Capricorn said.  “What can we do here?  These people-”“You don’t do anything,” Valefor interrupted.  “They’re ours.”“Yours!?” Tristan-as-Capricorn asked, voice raised, blurring.  Byron-as-Capricorn shook his head, and offered a more sedate, “No.”He was almost drowned out by the shouts and screams from the people on the ground.“Where is Mama Mathers?” Rain asked.“You should ask her, Rain,” Valefor said.  “Let her in, let me in, and pledge to obey.  We’ll let you drag these people away, so long as you stay.  They’re expendable, you’re blessed.”“How are you immune?” Tristan-as Capricorn called out.“Friends,” Rain said.  He created blades of silver light in each of his hands.  “Found these guys while researching powers and options.  March put the pieces together about who I am and where I’m from.”He’d indicated the woman with the bunny mask.  March continued pacing around the group.  Her rapier’s tip dragged along the ground.  It left a trail behind it, like the water rippling in the wake of a stick being moved in it, and that water had hues of blue, purple, and black running through it for a second or two after the contact.“I thought it was another kind of brainwashing after I heard about Valefor’s exploits in Brockton Bay, with the arrest and trial,” March said.  “It’s a good thing that my group has a lot of powers to work with.”A lot of powers.  Cluster capes?“A good thing, yeah,” Rain said.“I’m not poaching him,” March said.  “He’ll help me out in exchange for this, here, but he can stick with you guys.”“With the heroes here, not the Fallen,” Rain clarified.“Oh yes,” March said.  She nodded and the one ear at the top of her mask bobbed where it was folded at the tip.  “I should’ve been clear.”My eyes moved away from March to the people on the ground, then to the nearby buildings.  I couldn’t lose sight of the major goal here.  Was Mama Mathers there?  I could look at the civilians on the ground without a problem, which meant she wasn’t there, or her power was more subtle than that.  I’d caught a glimpse earlier, though, so she couldn’t be too far.  There were a dozen buildings in our immediate vicinity.  Was she watching through the window?The trouble was, if I saw her, I risked being affected like the people on the ground were.  If I didn’t see her, she had the advantage and she could catch us by surprise at a time of her choosing.The idea of losing my mind like that terrified me, to the point I felt like my gut and my brain were bound in knots.  I tried to focus that terror into a cold, rational look at what I needed to do.  Mama Mathers was the biggest danger.  Valefor was the second.  They were Masters and Strangers, the PRT classification for those who controlled others or minions, and the classification for those who infiltrated or deceived.  Mama Mathers and Valefor were squarely in the overlap between the two.I found myself missing my old team.  New Wave had had its problems, but I’d known the team and how it worked.  I wasn’t a strategist, but I could do fine if I could identify the big problems and solve them.  My tendency back in the day had been to hit hard as my method of solving, and to rely on my instincts and the team.These guys were hard to rely on.  New Wave had been all about straight lines of attack and barrier defenses.  Lasers and punching, shields and forcefields between danger and the vulnerable.  The most indirect we’d been was when my dad made his grenades bounce off walls or when my cousin had created forcefields in unconventional but otherwise simple shapes.Here?  Sveta had disappeared while all attention was on others.  Capricorn was… it looked like he was changing forms rapidfire to switch identities, so no one self heard a single whole utterance referring directly to them.Chris was off doing something, hopefully far away from this.  Rain was- he’d contacted people I barely recognized.  I’d seen March’s mask before, but it had been in passing.  An article about one of the big cities.  There’d been a weird dynamic there, but I couldn’t afford to dwell on it.  My mind went to a bizarre combination of upper-class and low-class crimes, like corporate espionage and petty vandalism, but I knew almost right away that I was thinking of the wrong person.It had been something offbeat like that, though.  If the people hadn’t been screaming, and if I wasn’t focused on Valefor’s body language and Mama being somewhere nearby, I wanted to think I could’ve placed it.I still had my hands by my ears, as a crummy and unreliable solution to a serious problem.My powers had been disrupted, put out of reach and made unreliable, but the effect was dissipating with time.  It killed me that the time was time innocents were suffering.There were goddamn kids in there.If I flew and hit someone, would I be risking the innocents on the ground?  They were close enough together that people on foot wouldn’t be able to get to Valefor without trampling the civilians.“There’s a pretty one lying next to me,” Valefor said.  “Short black hair, or so I hear, she tends to wear-”“I see her,” four-eyes said.“That’s all you needed?  Hm.  Step on her throat.  Not enough to kill.  Enough to give our Rain a time limit.”The guy with the four-eyed mask transitioned the four-horned girl to another, more mundane Fallen.Rain hurled his crescent blade.  Four-eyes drew his own, creating the diagrams- two faint and one clear, and he drew the clear one as part of the same motion.  His crescent-shaped sword was just in time to meet Rain’s power.  Both fizzled out.I saw as the other silver blade Rain held fritzed, distorted, and faded away.  He looked down at his hands.“He threw something at me,” Four-eyes said.“If it hit you, don’t move.”“It didn’t hit me.  I stopped it.”“Then step on the girl, Amaymon.”I flexed my aura, straining, praying it wouldn’t falter.  I saw people turn in my direction, including both Four-eyes and Valefor.I saw Valefor pause for half a second, catching his breath, drawing it in deeper, and I clamped my hands over my ears, bending over, eyes shut.Whatever he shouted, I didn’t hear anything muffled than a one-syllable word.  He had to refer to us to catch us, and now that I knew that, I could watch for tells.  If he drew in a deep breath to shout, or if he said something like ‘You’ or “Everyone’, I could cover my ears.All around us, most people stopped in their tracks.  Capricorn, blurring, changed to blue armor, but he kept walking.  I was able to move, and the group with March and Rain seemed unaffected.Valefor shouted out something, turning in my general direction as he did it.  Two words.  I didn’t try to make them out.The Fallen were bringing their powers to bear, now.  A snake shaped out of intestine and barbed wire- one I’d seen before.  The Fallen that summoned it was drawing a gun with the other hand.  Amaymon was creating his four diagrams, reaching for the sphere.He didn’t manage to touch it.  Sveta grabbed him and Valefor both, dragging them out of sight.  The afterimage of the diagram hung in the air for a moment before disappearing.Another was going breaker, arms and bony limbs reaching skyward in a fountain of parts that grabbed their other parts and forced them down in the swell, a large human skull that ate their head, then was swallowed up by a larger animal skull, like a wolf’s, only horned.They grew larger as they rose skyward, all white bone and jet black body parts.I tried to fly so I could fly to it before it grew any larger, and my flight only sputtered out.The one with the intestine snake lashed out, snake lunging from the palm of their hand to Capricorn and I.  They aimed and fired the gun at the same time.  Wild shooting.I brought out the Wretch, stepping between Capricorn and the shooter, and even with the Wretch being a larger target, none of the bullets hit it.I heard the shooting stop, the sound of the small pistol ringing in my ears.  I dropped my defenses for just a moment, so I could have the Wretch closer to me when I connected my fist to the Snake’s ‘head’.  It slammed into a building, shattering the stones and mortar that lined the lower half of the ground floor.  A half-second later, white noise filled my vision.If that had happened a second earlier, I might have missed.  The noise persisted.I scowled, stopping in my tracks, trying to find out what I needed to do.  I couldn’t run in and use the Wretch, not when people lined the ground like that.  Not when I couldn’t trust my eyes.  She wasn’t making me hallucinate, but she could obscure what I saw.“Down!” Capricorn said, behind me.  “Give me a clear view!”There were blue motes appearing around the snake-intestine cape and the giant breaker thing, which was slowing in its growth, but was a pretty considerable size already.  I realized the noise had gone away. Ahead of me, the Fallen woman disconnected the snake-thing from her left hand, and passed the gun to it.  The motes above and behind her turned to water, spraying down on her and at the giant breaker.The motes snapped into a solid form, making a creaking, cracking noise as they became a growth of stone that encased part of the snake-woman’s head and shoulder and part of three of breaker’s arms.The weight of the stone pushed her down and snared the breaker.  A moment before she was crushed beneath the stone, it became water again.  She was down on three limbs in an awkward position as it all cascaded and sprayed down around her, stirring the packed dirt road into thick mud spray.I leaped forward toward the spray, flight kicking in at half-strength to give me downward velocity.  I came down with one foot on her gun-hand, crushing it beneath my heel.  I stepped down by her face, and moved my foot off of her hand.  I pushed at her shoulder with my foot, flipping her over, then bent down for the gun.“Good,” Capricorn said, behind me.  He was Tristan, but the water was remaining water.“Careful you don’t drown the people on the ground,” I said.  “They’re helpless.  People can drown in shallow water.”He nodded, quick, before turning his attention back to the big thing, which was adjusting its balance.  The unexpected weight on one arm had brought it partially down.I had to do something.  I didn’t want to keep my head down.I ran to the side.  Down toward the direction where Sveta was, away from the big thing.  Against my instincts, but I had an idea of what I could do.Mama Mathers had been here.  She was close.  If I couldn’t see her without problems, I could only make assumptions.  Aura out, I ran along the side of the street, keeping one eye on the battle and the people on the ground, in case I was needed.  Women.  Young men.  Someone elderly.  Kids.  Shit.Ahead of me, Sveta was dealing with Amaymon and Valefor.  She’d pulled off her wig and stuffed it into Valefor’s mouth, and was now wrestling with Amaymon.  The cape broke her grip and pushed her to one side, and she collapsed into a heap, instead of catching her balance.He created his diagram while she was down.  He touched the javelin-dart, and he sent it plunging into Sveta’s chest before she could stand.I charged at him, running three steps and then flying the remaining twenty feet.  My knee connected with his jaw and he dropped.  I landed and made sure he wasn’t getting up.“Sveta,” I said.“I’m okay,” she said.  She sat up.  A tendril stuck out of the hole in her chest, feeling around it before withdrawing.  “I’m okay.”“You have a patch?” I asked.She nodded.  “You have your aura going.  It’s distracting enough I can’t coordinate.”I nodded, and I temporarily eased up on it.  “Your power is okay?”“Yes.  Why?”She hadn’t seen, she’d already backed off before Rain’s had been shorted out, so she would have been too far away.  Staying out of Valefor’s earshot, possibly.“He cancels out powers.”“You can’t really cancel out being Case fifty-three,” Sveta said.  “You’d better get back while I get patched, if your forcefield is weird.”I could have clarified, but I just nodded.  “Good luck.  Be safe.”“You too.”My aura back on blast, I flew across the street, then back toward the fighting.  March and her band of oddballs had been on the far side of Valefor’s cluster of capes.The large thing had fallen over, one hand planted on the ground near some of the civilians.  March ran up its arm, ducking and using momentum to slide up the slope of the arm as a bony claw reached for her.She ran along the shoulders, cutting as she went, leaped as the head sank into the morass of the body and became two avian skulls that pecked at the air, and then came down, stabbing her rapier into the chest and dragging the point against the giant thing’s torso, cutting as she went down.  The blue-purple-black watercolor spread in the wake of the blade’s tip.She pulled it free, stabbed at a reaching hand, and used it to reorient her fall.  She landed hard, her feet planted on either side of a screaming teenage girls’ head.  A slight misstep, and she would have caved in the poor girl’s face.March snapped her fingers and flicked with her blade.At the shoulder, where the long cut had started, there was a flare of the watercolor spray.  Purple and blue, with deep shadow in the midst of it.Her rapier swept out, pointing.  She called out, “Rain!”The flare was tracing along the line she’d cut like a flame down a cartoon bomb’s fuse.“I can’t!” Rain called out.The ‘fuse’ reached its terminus.  What had been a flare became a fierce explosion, right down at the base of the breaker.I flew toward it, bringing out the Wretch, so I could catch it if it toppled onto March and the civilians.  It didn’t, falling backward and dissolving as it did.The breaker form dissipated, and there was only the Fallen with the demon themed skull mask, tipping backward to land on his ass.  March plunged her rapier into his chest, then flicked it up, toward his throat.“It would have been perfect if that had also cut it in two, Rain,” March said.  “It was still perfect, but in a lesser way.”“Can you not use my name?” he asked.  “And Amaymon nullified my power.”The Fallen was patting his chest where he’d been stabbed.  He touched his throat.  Intact, but the line of watercolor marked him.“Valefor used your name,” she said.  She snapped her fingers.  “And you didn’t give me another one.”Still floating in the air, I could see the flare appear at the breaker Fallen’s chest.  He brought his hands to it, quick, frantic, then tried to pat it out.“Hey!” the Fallen cried out.  He lurched to his feet.  “Stop!”March was walking away.“Hey!  Fuck!  Help me!”She flourished with her blade and sheathed it, in the very same moment the fuse reached its terminus.  The explosion was smaller, but it was sufficient to take out the front of the Fallen’s throat.  He dropped to his knees, still moving inarticulately, eyes wide and stunned, and then collapsed to the ground.I- I didn’t like the killing, or the casual ease with which she’d done it.  These were Fallen, but they were low-level Fallen.I didn’t want to say not to kill, but…But there were civilians suffering.  Other things to focus on.I changed course, flying back to where I’d been.  I continued down the street.  I was putting the bulk of the lopsided engagement behind me, passing by Rain, by two twenty-ish capes with steel-gray hair, and that meant I could fly faster.  I kept my eyes on the people and goings-on behind me.I found what I was hoping for.  The screaming, just briefly, changed.  The aura extended through the hostages to Mama Mathers, and she affected the hostages in turn.  I had a sense of my range, and through that, I had a good sense of her location.“Rain!” I called out.“What is it?”“If she gets me, get people to take out the building.”“You found her?” he asked.I dug fingernails into the doorframe, then activated my forcefield.  I tore door and part of the frame away from the front of the store.  It was one of the smaller buildings on the street, and it was styled as a general store.The screaming trailed off altogether.  I gripped the damaged wall where the doorframe had been attached, and tore at that too.  The Wretch struck at other things.“She says to stop,” a voice said.It wasn’t one of the people who’d been on the ground.  He was older- one of the soldiers.  In the eerie quiet, with people whimpering and making small noises, he still had to raise his voice to be heard, with distances.He was possibly unpowered, and he was holding an axe.  He was average height, but muscular, and had a slight belly, such that his body looked more like a solid slab than a chest that tapered down to a stomach or had any proper shape.  His skin was sun-tanned, his hair blond with white shooting through it.  A bandanna with a demon’s mouth on it covered his lower face.“You’ve disappointed her, Rain,” the soldier said.  Then he said, “You disappointed all of us.”“For one of the first times in my life, I feel like I’m doing something right,” Rain said.“No, Rain,” the man said.  “She says you might be doing good, objectively, but not right.  She says… she’ll surrender herself to your custody.  She’ll withdraw her power from everyone here.”“From everyone,” Rain said.“As you wish.”March put the sword nearer to the man’s neck.  He gripped the axe tighter.“Don’t,” Rain said.  “He’s a relative.”She lowered the sword, and she poked the handle of the axe with the tip.  She said something I didn’t hear.The soldier dropped the axe.Rain was kneeling by Erin.  He placed a hand on a little boy’s arm, where the boy lay next to her, hands at his ears.He reached out for Erin, and she pushed his hand away.  When he stood, it was abrupt.“This feels like a trap,” I said.Rain approached me.  He looked at the building, then raised a hand.  In the recess of one voluminous sleeve, I could see another hand hidden within.“What is it?”“One person,” he said.  “I think.”“It could still be a trap,” I said.“Yeah.  But… this gets people out safe.  If we went after her and she hurt them in the last moment, and if we couldn’t turn it off…”I nodded.March was walking toward us.“You got a look at her.  She’s in you?” Rain asked.“Barely,” I said.  “She blinded me once or twice.”“Okay,” he said.March joined us.  She put out a hand for me to shake.  I hesitated a moment, paranoid, then shook it.“We have things to talk about,” she said.  “People we both know.  Power things.”I nodded.“I’ll go in to get her,” she said.  “I’m immune.”“So am I,” Rain said.“This is personal for you,” she said.  She put a gloved hand on his shoulder.  “It’s the objectivity that makes us valuable to each other.”She winked at me, then sauntered indoors.She bothered me.  I didn’t like whimsical and show-off in someone that could easily kill.  The mask and the marching band outfit only marked out the contrast.“Immune?” I asked.Rain indicated the two capes with gray hair, a young man and woman.  Both had eyepatches, the steel-gray hair, and costumes with white and black.  Chris’ age, or a bit older.  “Dino and Enyo.  They’re multi-triggers, and they’re also twin triggers.  One of their powers is that they can transplant body parts, with some special rules.  I’m borrowing someone else’s eyes and ears, and a few other bits, so she can touch me and make it hurt, but it’s dulled, and she can’t do anything else.  The transplant recipient is back at our base, sedated.”“All multi-triggers?” I asked.“She… collects them.  I guess.  She studies them.  It’s supposed to be important.”Rain was looking back in Erin’s direction.  She had the little boy with her, and two adults.  From the resemblance, a sibling and her parents.  She and they all looked like anyone might after having seen things that had them screaming for ten or fifteen minutes straight.  Weary, eyes wide, defensive.But, all that in mind, she seemed to find refuge in her parents.“What-” I started.“This power I lost.  Do I get it back?”“Yeah.  I got mine back after ten minutes or so.”Rain nodded.“What happened with Erin?”“The Fallen ruined it.  I ruined it.  She wouldn’t leave.  I couldn’t stay.”“I’m sorry.”“Don’t let me hurt Mama.  I’d do it in a stupid way that might get people hurt,” he said.“Yeah,” I said.  I nodded slowly.  “One day, maybe you return the favor on that.”He made a small, amused sound.  Aside from a laugh here or there, at the bad cape names, or a good moment with Tristan, I wasn’t sure I’d ever seen that from him.“Sure,” he said.“All set, coming down!” March called out.  “We’re taking this slow.”“What would you have done, if she hadn’t called it off?” Rain asked.“Controlled collapse of the structure,” I said.  “If she had hostages in there, I’d set it up so she’d have to tell me.”The whiteness in my eyes flared up.  I rubbed at one eye, uselessly.“There’s a chance she’d throw their lives away to fuck with you,” Rain said.I drew in a deep breath, sighed.  “Yeah.  That was a risk.”“With some people, you don’t get to win,” Rain said.  “She’s that kind of person.  Be careful.”I nodded, folding my arms.“I like the costume,” he said.  “March told me I shouldn’t be so negative all the time, so I figured I’d say it.  I feel like I’ve missed a lot.”I winced.“What happened?” he asked.“Damsel happened.”“Damsel?” he asked.  “Is she okay?”“She’s alive and mostly intact,” I said.  “Damage to her prosthetic.  But someone else is dead.”“Shit.  Is it-”I could hear March.  “I’ll catch you up on particulars later.  But you should know, because we’re going to have to explain it to Looksee.”Rain nodded.  “Shit.”March emerged.  She had Mama Mathers wrapped in a bedsheet, which was bound with cord that had tassels on the end.  Something from her costume, it seemed.I didn’t know or trust March.  “Is it her?  That’s Mama Mathers?”“It’s her,” Rain said.  “I’ve seen her enough to know.”“You and I need to have a conversation about your power,” March said.  “The emotion power.”“I forgot to turn it off while you were inside.”“I know what it does,” she said.  “It’s not strong.”“It’s never strong.”“But it’s not useless either.  Nearly useless,” she said.March walked the Fallen leader out to the street.  From the other end of the fight, Sveta had Valefor, the wig stuffed in his mouth and tied in place with lengths of hair knotted together.  Her head seemed slim without ears or hair to bulk it out.  She looked more intense in expression and demeanor, her ‘scalp’, the sides of her head and her neck formed of the muscle-like gatherings of tendrils.  Everything was bound down firm with the metal rings, only the shortest of tendrils curling up and out, an inch or two long, each.The boy of the eyepatch pairing had a syringe with him.  He looked grim as the girl -his sister, I was assuming- reached out to wrap her fingers around Mama Mathers’ arm.  She flinched back.The boy held out the syringe, and the girl depressed the plunger to squirt some out.They inserted the syringe and injected the contents.  Mama Mathers slumped, and then collapsed into waiting arms.Rain nodded, watching.  Capricorn and the others were catching up, with Capricorn reaching out to grab Rain’s hand as he reached his friend.  The soldier from before was shackled, the pair with eyepatches went to March’s side.The civilians were a herd of people, wounded and scared.  Some approached us.  Others backed off.  I had to wonder about the latter group.“We’ll reunite with Narwhal’s group, to give or get backup,” Capricorn said.  “Then we cut across… just about everything, and we evacuate out.”“Sounds good,” March said.“We’ll help Weld if he needs it,” Capricorn said.I weighed the alternatives.  There weren’t any great answers.  Going it alone and trying to get to Gilpatrick’s group meant we could be intercepted, and it left the others fighting a nasty sort of fight, where guns were being brought into things.  Going to the others meant possible problems could complicate things.The practice of getting ourselves to the western edge of the wider settlement was a bit of a herding game, keeping a dozen traumatized people moving, while simultaneously managing our hostages, Valefor and Mama Mathers.  Half of the group kept gravitating in the pair’s direction, and the other half seemed scared of them, even when they were bound and tranquilized, respectively.  Erin seemed to do more with an active focus, so she took on some of the cheerleading duties, especially with the younger ones.One of the Fallen groups was led by a cape with a horse’s head and a dozen shadowy duplicates in his company, all connected together by a mess of black lighting with weirdly curved arcs.In any other circumstance, the Fallen would have been losing against the Wardens’ bench team and young members, but there were twenty or so civilians with them, and the civilians had assault rifles, and the Fallen capes in their group seemed both confident and costumed enough to be of some importance.There was a flanking group of the Fallen who’d fallen back and were taking cover by a building.  Some Clan capes were mixed into the group.  Guns were pointed in our general direction as we emerged, but the guns immediately pointed skyward as they realized who we had with us.That effect seemed to sweep over the Fallen.  I made special note of the Fallen who weren’t immediately going still and quiet.  There were ones in elaborate costumes, many with tattoos of text or numbers down their arms.  They’d be the leadership.The one with the horse head mask wasn’t backing off, either.  He just gathered his shadowy clones around him.I kept my distance from the rest of the group, floating out in front, the Wretch active.  March was doing much the same, but without the benefit of invincibility.  The rapier was extended out, pointing at the people with guns.Hollow Point’s capes were on the fringes, gathered like they had when Advance Guard had turned up in Cedar Point, with a divide marking the distinction between Prancer’s side of things and the others.  Beast of Burden’s group, minus both Beast of Burden and Damsel, a twenty foot gap with only three capes in it, and then Prancer’s assembly, with an injured Moose, an injured Velvet, Bitter Pill’s group with Bluestocking frothing at the mouth, and the Speedrunners.I recognized the three capes in the no man’s land as Love Lost, Snag, and Cradle.  The clients who’d paid for this whole thing, with the aim of getting Rain in the midst of the chaos.  If they had an assassin, I couldn’t tell who it was.  Nobody seemed especially out of place.It was my first proper sighting of Cradle.  He wore a bodysuit and an elaborate sculpted mask with a hand worked into it, fingers and thumb curled into claws, worked into his face and around his eyes and nose as if seen from the side.  His bodysuit had much the same design, white hands against black mesh fabric.More noticeable was the mech, if it could be called that.  He stood on a platform that looked like an outstretched hand.  A framework of six mechanical arms and four giant hands extended out and around the platform.With our arrival, the gunfire had stopped.  The heroes’ side wasn’t sending any volleys or attacks out, now that the Fallen seemed more subdued.Someone on the Fallen side said something, and guns were put down.“It’s over!” Capricorn shouted.  “Stand down!”They were rule-breakers, killers, child kidnappers, addicts, and worse.  They included racists in their number without flinching, because it served their ends.  They’d celebrated the end of the world, where billions had died.  Maybe tens of billions or more, depending on how much damage Scion had done to parallel worlds.If they didn’t listen- if they even got desperate, this would be a disaster.Please stop, I thought, even as I simultaneously thought about what I’d need to do if they snapped.  When they snapped.I had zero faith they’d back down.  By body language alone, it seemed Rain felt the same way.I watched as the first one stepped away from cover, hands raised.  Others followed.  They glared, looked tense, even said coarse things.What was the catch?  The trap?Not because they were outnumbered.  They’d always been outnumbered.  That left me considering other traps, along a broader line.  Access to certain people?  Would Valefor reveal his eyesight power when people like Narwhal were close?  Did Mama Mathers hope to catch someone important with her power?Or was it more mundane?  Surrendering and going to the overtaxed courts could be a way for them to get a voice, with a wealth of attention.  If the lawyers and administration on our side wasn’t up to things, and if the Fallen matched it by playing things particularly well, then they could walk away more or less free, with many more followers.I heard Rain and Capricorn exchange words.  Rain turned toward Sveta and I and subtly indicated what he and Capricorn were talking about.  Snag was staring us down from the far end of the battlefield, with hilly, rocky ground between us, the trees and Wardens to the left, and the assembled Fallen and their allies to the right.“March reached out to him before she reached out to me.  He knows who she is, which… isn’t great.”“You think he knows who you are?” Sveta asked.“We’ll see, I guess,” Rain said.Prancer had emerged from Cedar Point’s group, and was approaching heroes, hands raised.If I accepted that things were going reasonably well here, this was a good outcome.  Civilians had been hurt, people had died, but Prancer hadn’t achieved his win, and Snag’s group wasn’t going to get their opportunity.If I accepted it.  I couldn’t bring myself to.There were powerful capes here.  Mama Mathers hadn’t had enough people defending her.  Had it been that she’d been caught off guard by Rain being prepared?  Or was my initial impression of this being a trap correct?What did she want and what did she get?I heard a commotion.  Noises of surprise and alarm.The Fallen who had been turning themselves in were now turning on heroes.  People were picking up guns.The number of heroes there had diminished.  Heroes had disappeared.What followed was like dominoes falling, as the trap fell into place.  Narwhal created her crystalline forcefields, only for the forcefields to change tint.  The horse-head cape sent a duplicate her way, and she wasn’t able to get her forcefields up or into place in time.From that, I knew the culprits of this turnaround.More heroes were disappearing.  A member of Prancer’s group threw something into the midst of their group, and that something exploded.  The explosions repeated, one after another, at steady intervals.The other-From our first briefing on them, we’d know they had a guy who could appear at our most vulnerable point and catch us off guard.I turned away from the spectacle in front of me, looking for the one who might be coming after the ones who’d gotten Mama Mathers and Valefor.  Behind us, to the sides-In the midst of us.Secondhand looked average, with flat, opaque goggles and a flat top cap, but he flickered intensely with afterimages and suggestions of places he might be in the future.  The images were violent enough he looked ready to burst, and he was right in the middle of our group.  I swung a punch, and he moved with enhanced speed, ducking it.The quick movement pushed him over the brink, or so it seemed.  He detonated, and everything moved like it was slow motion, as I was thrown off my feet, the wind knocked out of my lungs.  Others were shoved back and away from him too.  My skin felt like it was tearing apart, because the slow motion was real, and different parts of me were slowed, while others weren’t.  My lower body was more affected, as was the part of me closer to the front.It hit everyone except for Mama Mathers, who Secondhand zipped over to, to catch out of mid-air, and Valefor, who blurred, hair moving slightly, but the rest of him remained unaffected.That would be Final Hour.  The targeted slow-motion, granting a kind of protection.I used my flight to keep myself from being thrown back too much, canceling out the inertia and then flying toward them.  I didn’t have long, and with them this coordinated, they’d dogpile me in an instant.I went straight for Valefor.He was still protected as I brought the Wretch out.  When I punched him, I could feel the Wretch meet that invisible barrier.  I could see, in slow motion through both the expulsion of Secondhand’s detonation and Last Minute’s protective effect, the destruction of Valefor’s lower face as the Wretch passed through the barrier.I couldn’t bring myself to kill, even now.  I canceled out my power of my own volition, when it was clear that I’d destroyed his jaw.As one, the hostages we’d rescued were taking action.  They moved in near-unison, some reacting to the movements of others by taking up the call.  They climbed to their feet, and they reached for us, clutching.  Their expressions weren’t the ones they’d worn a moment ago.The disconnection in my thinking and the speed of our immediate reality let me connect that dot too.  Valefor hadn’t managed a secret command.  He’d planted one on the group before Mama Mathers had laid them out flat.Telling them to attack us when we were off guard, or when he gave some signal.  Erin was coming after Rain.  So was her little brother, who couldn’t have been older than nine.The slow was wearing off.  I had only a moment.  I flew to the others, grabbing them, dragging them away.  Sveta and Capricorn.  Capricorn had a grip on Rain’s arm, so I brought Rain too, my fingers straining as I tried to hold onto three people for just a moment.  I’d never tried or even thought about it, but in the instant, I pulsed my forcefield on and off, to try to keep the Wretch from getting enough of a presence to reach out and hurt anyone.I just needed to carry them for a few seconds.Capricorn disappeared from my grip, and for an instant, I thought I’d lost my grip on him.  and my hand crackled as he did.  I turned to look, and saw the man with the goggles and mustache pointing his finger at us.End of Days, I thought, as I headed toward the ground.He wasn’t even a time manipulator.  I felt deeply offended at that fact, or I must have- it was a poignant enough feeling that I could feel it even as I took in the magnitude of just how the tides had turned, and how bad a thing that was.  They’d hit each of our groups, and they’d hit us hard.I heard an assault rifle fire, and others took up the call.  It was more one-sided, this time, not two sides shooting at each other, but one side shooting at the rest.I landed on the far side of a slope, with just Sveta.  I took the moment to try to gather my senses.  I hurt all over, and I had blood in my eyes.  The slow-motion effect from Secondhand.Sveta had a rip in the edge of her face, but she barely seemed to care.  She was more focused on getting to her feet.Capricorn had disappeared.  Damsel wasn’t here.  Chris and Looksee were on the fringes or not even in the area.I could feel droplets of moisture on my bare skin.Rain.I flew close to the ground, using the hill as cover, Wretch out in case a stray bullet came my way or cut through the dirt.  I peeked around the edge of the hill’s slope.  My eyes took in the scene at a glance, and partway through that glance, the scene changed.Darkness.  No sun shining through overcast clouds.  Only darkness.  Light leeched in through some other way, giving just enough to outline the surroundings.The air smelled like ash, and it was dry enough that it felt like my mouth and body were being leeched of moisture.End of Days.  He’d caught me, seeing me before I’d seen him.My heart was pounding.  I couldn’t bring myself to speak, because I was afraid I’d scream.  The best case scenario was that at this vital, critical moment I’d been shunted out and away, to some strange, dark place.The worst case scenario was that it was a permanent shunt.A small sound escaped my throat as I looked around.A minute passed.Two minutes.  When my eyes played tricks on me through the darkness, I saw Valefor’s jaw shattering.  I imagined the battlefield, as it had been.Anger took over the devastation and surprise.  I fidgeted.  I adjusted my costume.  I flew around in circles, trying to get a sense of what this place was like.  I stopped when I flew into a tree I couldn’t see.I watched as the light grew brighter, as if it shone in through invisible cracks that were widening.  The cracks soared tall and wide, and the light flooded in, blinding.I was hauled out of that dark, strange world and back into my reality, and I felt the change in air pressure, the moisture of the drizzling rain. and I saw that things had happened in the meantime.Sveta and Capricorn were fighting side by side, with Love Lost and a crowd of controlled civilians between them and Rain.  The presence of the mob of Valefor’s affected hostages kept Sveta from getting to any of us, and complicated her skirmish with Love Lost.  Two of March’s group members were part of that same crowd, trying to fend the civilians off, and they weren’t trying to be gentle about it like Sveta was.Rain, meanwhile, was trying to fight Snag.  Snag was above him, pushing him to the ground, knee on Rain’s stomach.  He’d destroyed one of Snag’s arms and his two good arms were at the remaining, damaged one, which had a slice taken out of it.  His other two mechanical arms were gripping Snag’s normal arm, no longer encased in the giant, oversized prosthetic part.  Even with their combined strength, the two mechanical arms were losing, cracking and splintering under the pressure.This was the chaos Snag had wanted.I flew to him, praying I wouldn’t get another End of Days timeout.I was halfway to him when Rain’s arms broke.The blades fixed in the midst of the breakable shells continued up and out, piercing Snag’s forearm and scissoring the space between them as his weight came down and made them shift.Snag hauled back, pulling away, swinging his damaged prosthetic arm, while holding his damaged regular arm out.  Blood poured from the ragged wounds in his arm.  One of the blades had gone in one side and out the other.In any other day, any other circumstance, I never would have imagined I’d have let this go.But others needed help.  Rain was mostly in the clear, as he and Snag parted.  Sveta and Capricorn weren’t.I flew down to where Sveta had been pulled to the ground.  Her balance wasn’t good, and when she was brought down, it was hard for her to find her feet again.  Once I touched down in the middle of the pack of people, it was a question of getting people back without hurting them too badly.  I grabbed her and used flight as much as anything to haul her up and away, so we were above the fighting.It was a vantage point for me to see Rain facing off against Snag.  He’d hit Snag with a crescent blade, and the man had a line of silver across face and shoulder.  He didn’t move, and blood continued to seep down his arm and hand.Sveta reached over, grabbed grass, because it was the only thing to grab, and hauled herself to the ground over there, to where she could talk to Rain or help Snag.I flew down to Capricorn.  Love Lost leaped up at me, intercepting.  Her initial contact broke through the Wretch.  Her mover power let her connect to me despite the interruption in her course.  I felt her claws scrape my breastplate.I punched her, and she dropped down and away, landing amid people.Rain had hit Snag again.  Keeping him from moving.On my second try, I got to Capricorn.  I pulled him free, holding him with both hands, my arms straining.I saw Love Lost get to her feet, reaching for her mask.I saw her sway and then fall, like the lights had gone out.Snag had already fallen.  Either he’d been hit, or he’d elected to try moving, because one of the silver lines had split.  His neck was gouged where it joined the shoulder, a wound deep enough it should have exposed shoulderblade and collarbone.  It didn’t, because the blood was thick, and his beard was dense.Rain was on the ground.  In the distance, perched on a hill, Cradle slumped on his platform.The drizzle became rain, punctuated by gunfire.  There was fighting everywhere, and even the people that were holding back were hitting pretty damn hard now.  Not dissimilar to how I had with Valefor.Not heroes and villains.  Only monstrousness and madness.                                                                                        Shadow – Interlude 5.x                                                                                        “Deaths.”“I beg your pardon?”“You’re acting on feeling, not fact.  If we do as you suggest, people will die,” Jeanne Wynn said.  She stood from her seat and used one hand to slide a laptop across the long table, until it was in front of Mr. John Druck.  She fixed the angle of the laptop, then stood back.  “These are the travel times for the supply trucks, these-”She leaned over and struck a key.“Are the production rates for the farms and the expected yield.  When we asked, the agriculture groups were conservative.  We asked others and did an independent estimate.  Our numbers are less conservative, but we’re still cutting it close.  We don’t have enough to feed people, and we don’t have enough to shelter people.”“The workers need protections,” Sierra Kiley said.“We do,” Mr. Druck said.  He leaned back in his seat.“Absolutely,” Jeanne said.  “Speaking for Mortari, we’re not against labor law.  We have some notes on future proposals for you to take home, which you should like.”“Should I?  Will I love it?” Mr. Druck asked.“Not love.  But you’ll like it fine.  Everything cascades, Mr. Druck.  One thing leads to another.  We like a lot of the things that fit into the labor protection and we need to be mindful of some of those cascading factors.  Shorter working hours improves health, and health is something that is going to rear its head before we’re done dealing with war and winter.”“The specter of war, not the reality.  Don’t try to scare us, Mrs. Wynn,” Sierra Kiley said.“It’s a reality,” Jeanne said.  “But it’s not what I want to focus on right now.  Refugees reaching us from Bet are coming with some severe health issues.  The worker surveys you were complaining about last week are giving us information today.  People are reporting severe fatigue.  It looks like your workers are sick, Mr. Druck.  They need to account for that, because it’s not going to get better, they haven’t been getting paid while they’re striking, and the weather is getting colder.”“Of course your surveys are giving you convenient points of data,” Sierra Kiley said.“What kind of sick are you talking about?” Mr. Druck asked.Jeanne reached down to the keyboard and moved the cursor before striking a key.Mr. Druck stared at the screen.“Show me?” Sierra asked.Mr. Druck slid the laptop closer to her.“Is it the power plants?” Mr. Druck asked.“No,” Jeanne said.  “Believe it or not, most nuclear power plants are remarkably safe.  Capes and countermeasures were ready to handle most of them the moment we knew what was going on with Gold Morning.  There is a radiation problem in Bet and it’s not from that.”“Because of him?” Buckner asked.  The man was prematurely graying, but attractive.  He was also the man in charge of most of the news media, new small screen endeavors and new movie projects.  In the next year, his work would start to see fruit.He’d asked about ‘him’.  Scion.“We thought it was industrial contaminants, but it may be deeper than that.  Some of it might be how Scion decided to use his power.  More of it is the sheer damage he did to the planet itself.  There’s a degree of it that’s impossible to know for certain, that has to do with the Class-S phenomena.  Portals to other worlds, tinker tech left to molder.  It’s not only the radiation either.  Methane levels are rising, food stockpiles on that side are dwindling fast, and the people there are getting sick for a variety of reasons.  We’re facing some immediate sacrifices if we want to keep the remaining people in Bet alive,” Jeanne said.“I’m always leery of those who say others need to make sacrifices,” Mr. Nieves said.Jeanne raised an eyebrow.  Gary Nieves was a little on the portly side, and if he wasn’t at least forty, he certainly looked it.  Otherwise, the man looked after himself and portrayed a good face to his constituency.  Of the five people contending for mayorship over the city, where roughly half of the North American survivors of Gold Morning were staying, he polled in fourth place.Still, of the five people in the running, he was one of the three who were present and discussing things.  In a sense, really.  He was slow to provide workable solutions and quick to criticize.  In another era, he might have been a politician who rose up by being an effective critic of the incumbent.  In this era, there was no incumbent.“We’re all going to need to make sacrifices,” Jeanne said.  “You can see our proposals online.  The reception is strong.  I can give each of you the first look at what we’re looking at doing, so we can all be on the same page.  Anyone can visit our website and see the roadmap we laid out.  This, what we’re talking about today, with labor law.  It will improve employee health by one stage of separation.  General happiness, satisfaction, keeping the peace, lower crime, all are minor factors or two steps or more removed.”“That doesn’t mean they’re insignificant,” Mr. Druck said.“Not insignificant.  I would say…”“Relatively less significant,” Jeanne’s assistant and husband Kurt said.  He had his own laptop in front of him, and his eyes didn’t leave the screen, peering past thick-framed glasses that faintly reflected the image on the glowing screen.  The sky beyond the window was dark, even with it being the middle of the afternoon, and the lights in the meeting room were off.“Thank you dear,” Jeanne said.Mr. Druck’s expression twisted.  With Jeanne standing beside him, he had to push his chair back to take her in in full.  He growled out the words, “Relatively less?”“Compared to projected deaths in the millions,” Jeanne said, gently.  “You can push us on this, but I think you’ll find that when the bodies start stacking up and people start finding out that their loved ones still on Bet are suffering or coming back with cancer, people will start asking why we weren’t more ready.  You won’t have people on your side if it comes to that.”“You’re going to suggest they ask, aren’t you?” Sierra Kiley asked.“No.  But I don’t know what Mr. Buckner will do,” she lied.  She glanced at the media mogul.“The news would report the truth, of course,” Mr. Buckner said.“Of course,” Sierra said.Jeanne moved her laptop, sliding it to her end of the table.  Kurt handed her four ring-bound booklets without her asking.She paused, laying one hand flat against the booklet on top of the short stack.“Our proposal,” she said, returning her focus to the room.  She distributed the booklets to Mr. Nieves, Mr. Buckner, Ms. Kiley, and Mr. Druck.  “Read it.  It’s our suggestion for worker protections and remediation, to go into effect in April of next year.  If there’s an aspect of it you don’t like-”“April?” Mr. Druck interrupted.“-You may want to see our website.  You can add and subtract factors and adjust the numbers, and it will note the effects, based on peer reviewed study and the input of some great minds.  You don’t have to agree with the numbers, but they may help you predict our responses.”“April,” Mr. Druck said, with more emphasis.  “They’re not going to stand for this.”“You riled them up, Mr. Druck, or you allowed them to be riled up,” Jeanne said.  “This is in their best interests.  Have them return to work.  If they work themselves to the bone, lives will be saved, and they could be heralded as heroes in their own right.”“A tainted word, hero,” Mr. Nieves said.“People aren’t machines, Jeanne,” Sierra Kiley said.  “They’re not numbers on a spreadsheet.  They won’t want to go back to work without any incentives.”“I’m trying to save as many people as I can.  If people are reduced to numbers on a spreadsheet here, it’s because we have to work on that scale, we’re doing it in the best ways we can, for their benefit.”“People are irrational,” Sierra said.  “Brockton Bay and New Brockton are platinum standards when it comes to rebuilding after a disaster.  Trust me when I say that people don’t act in their own best interests.  Especially when it comes to making sacrifices.”“The only way we save those millions –tens of millions- is if we bring them from Earth Bet to here and give them the care they need.  We have to let the remaining refugees in before winter takes hold and before war necessitates barring passage.  It means throwing paperwork out the window and focusing on transporting them in, and it’s going to be hell.  It’s also going to need people to help it happen.”“Mr. Druck’s people,” Sierra said.“And yours.  New Brockton is important in this.  Talk to your workers.  If the ones who were in Bet too long start working now and get sick, they’ll be protected financially.  It’s in the proposal.  That’s your incentive.”Ms. Kiley and Mr. Druck leaned together, whispering.Jeanne took a seat next to Kurt, situating her laptop back in front of herself.  She checked her messages.  The attack on the Fallen was underway.  There were already deaths, and it would get worse before it got better.No other news.  It was the other news that concerned her most.  Others were playing a different game, and their perspectives were… distorted.  They might have said the same for her, even with her ongoing efforts to maintain some objectvity.“I think this may be my last day sitting in on these meetings,” Mr. Nieves said, interrupting her thoughts.  She noticed that he hadn’t opened the booklet she’d placed in front of him, or even moved it from the position.“Why?” Jeanne asked.“I serve a dwindling base.  Every day that passes that we don’t go back to Bet to rebuild is a day I lose the faith of my supporters.”“We’ll be sorry to see you go, Mr. Nieves,” she said.“No you won’t,” he said.“Your perspective has always been valuable.  A dissenting voice is valuable,” Jeanne said.“An ineffectual voice, if an essentially critical one,” he said.  “Don’t flatter me.  I’m not interested, and I don’t want flattery from you.”The tone of those last few words saw Ms. Kiley and Mr. Druck stop talking and start paying attention to Mr. Nieves.“I thought we got along fine.”“I’ve always wondered about these booklets and your computer program.  Others wonder too.”Website, not computer program, Jeanne mentally corrected.  “Wonder?”“The exacting numbers, the complexity. This was made by parahumans.”“We consulted them, yes.”He pushed the booklet her way.  “This is parahuman, not human.”“All of us are in this together, Gary,” Jeanne said.  “Human and parahuman.”“It’s as if we’re locked in a cage with a wolf,” Mr. Nieves said.  “Except I have to wonder about the ‘we’ part of it.  Ms. Kiley is a vaguely familiar name.  Not to her credit, but familiar.  I could believe she’s not a parahuman.  I don’t think she would be a good leader, but she’s not one of them.  You, though.”Not a trailing thought, not a question.  A statement.“We believe in using every resource we have to do the greatest amount of good,” Jeanne said.Gary Nieves stood from his seat.  He picked up the book, holding it by one corner.  He looked like he was going to say something, then stopped.  When he did speak, it was with a different expression- sadder than angry.“Sitting at this table, being a part of discussions with other Earths, talking to the Wardens, everything else, it affords us a privilege the people don’t get.  We have to hear how bad it really is.”Sierra spoke, “I’d phrase it as ‘we get to hear’, not ‘have to hear’.”“It’s an opportunity to help,” Jeanne said.Mr. Nieves shook his head.  “Every time I come here, I hear about new disasters.  Machinery that should never have been built, now with dead owners, still running.  People that snapped with the end of the world.  Broken quarantines.  Every time I come, three to five days a week, something new.  Today I hear about a war outside of New Haven, and innocents will die, many will come out in body bags.”“The straw that broke the camel’s back?” Mr. Buckner asked.  The media mogul sounded more casual than anything.Nieves didn’t sound casual.  “It’s one more thing.  Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it’s the parahumans.  It’s wolves people like me are trapped in a cage with, and they’re gathering into packs and reverting to their feral programming.”“Wolves were domesticated to become dogs,” Jeanne said.“These wolves killed billions,” Gary Nieves said.  “I don’t think we can afford to give them more power over us.  We don’t have that much left to spare.”“What would you propose as an alternative?” Jeanne asked.  “If you’ll read the booklet, I think it’s sound and there’s nothing especially strange in there.”Gary’s smile was tight, fighting to become a sneer, because of the feelings he was holding back.  Disgust.  “I’ve talked to people about it.  Ex-PRT, police, scholars.  Those conversations were back when I thought I could get a foothold here, when I thought people might see what you’re doing and where it comes from.”‘What are we doing?” Jeanne asked.“Using powers.  I asked about these proposals and I got a lot of answers and information about powers, the push toward violence and the dramatic, the loss of the human in the midst of it all.  There was a time when many people with powers wanted to use their powers for mundane things.  Rogues.  It kept going wrong, didn’t it?”“We could have a discussion on that,” Jeanne said.  “If it’s a concern, I’d like to address it, because it’s nuanced.”Nieves shook his head, expression twisting again.  “If you know, then you know.  When powers are used to produce materials, generate powers, there are traps, aren’t there?  The powers don’t want to be used for simple, stupid things like nine to five jobs or manual labor.  They want to fight, to hurt, or to cause chaos.”“Many of them do, yes,” Jeanne said.“Even when they seem tame, it ends in disaster.  Hidden catches, or materials that were conjured from nowhere start to go back to nowhere after months or years.”“Other worlds, not nowhere.  But yes.”Gary Nieves threw the booklet across the table.  “What’s the catch?  Where’s the trap?”“There’s a subset of powers that seem to buck the trend, Mr. Nieves.  That’s what I’d like to discuss with you, if it’s a concern.”Powers derived from other sources.  Powers bought and bartered for.But to say it here, with people like Mr. Druck and Mr. Buckner at the table?  Too dangerous.“I’m done,” Mr. Nieves said.  “You don’t need to worry about me anymore.  I’m not a general who can handle this war that seems so inevitable, and I’m not someone who can come up with computer programs that break something this chaotic into something deceptively elegant-”Kurt sniffed slightly.“-And frankly,” Mr. Nieves said, “It fucking terrifies me that you’re one or both of those things.”Those were the man’s parting words.  Mr. Nieves gathered his things, including an umbrella, and marched from the room that was far too large for the table in its center.“We’ll look this over and we’ll discuss,” Sierra said.“I’ll discuss with people, sound them out,” Mr. Druck said.“Thank you,” Jeanne said.“I’ll talk to some people about it as well,” Mr. Buckner said.  “I’m going to go before there’s any rain.”“What we discuss here stays off the record,” Jeanne said.“Yes, yes.  Off the record, but still important.”A power player of another sort, but at least he was cooperative.Mr. Druck and Mr. Buckner left.  Two very different people- the working class spokesman and the master of media with his expensive suit.  They talked as they went.Kurt, Sierra, and Jeanne remained.“Any word?” Sierra asked.  “You were looking at your computer.”“Seven fatalities.  Both villain groups had guns.  I haven’t heard about any of your… compatriots being hurt.”“Citrine-” Sierra started.  “Jeanne.  There was an occasion about three days ago that I was updating them on our meetings here.  Tattletale said that Cauldron once told the Undersiders that they had no interest in being in charge.”“I’m not Cauldron,” Jeanne said.“It looks to me like you married in,” Sierra said.Jeanne looked at her hand, then at Kurt’s.  The bands were Damascus, not gold.  Hers had a yellow diamond inset into it.  Gold had seemed crass, but a yellow gemstone had seemed essential.“And,” Sierra said.  “I couldn’t help but notice you haven’t denied you want to be in charge.”“Humanity is wounded on an extradimensional, macro level,” Jeanne said.  “Finding solutions for this kind of damage requires the perspective of people with a sense for the big picture.  The biggest kind of picture.”“But do you want it?  That position, where you’re finding the solutions and looking down on things from that high a seat?”“Yes,” Jeanne said.“You might be the only person that really wants it,” Sierra said.“We might be the only ones who can do it,” Jeanne said.“Gary’s right.  That’s spooky,” Sierra said.“I don’t think that’s fair.”Sierra nodded.  She gathered her things.  No umbrella or raincoat.  Jeanne had always felt Sierra was more the type to walk in the rain and let it pour down onto her than to be wearing business casual in a room like this.The book was the last thing Sierra picked up.  She looked at the cover.“Want another copy to give to Tattletale?” Jeanne asked.“Sure.”Jeanne tapped her power, covering the table’s long surface with a yellow tint.  In a second mind’s eye, she could see that slice of space as a world unto itself.  There were around sixty thousand variables that Jeanne was aware of, but she had to look for them to grasp them.  Friction.  Tuned… seventy five units.She gave the book a push, and it sailed across the table like an air hockey puck, rotating.  Sierra stopped it with one hand.One of Sierra’s fingers tapped the cover.  “Accord?”“Yes.”“Spooky,” Sierra said, again.  She collected the book, putting it with the other, and gathered her bag.Jeanne continued to feel it wasn’t a very fair assertion.  She sat back down beside Kurt, at the empty table in a hall that could have hosted an elegant ballroom dance, with tables at either end, a bar, and more room for groups to gather by the windows and socialize.She poked at the key on her keyboard to refresh the page.No news.She moved over to the side of the keyboard to hit the key combination to switch windows, and her fingers met Kurt’s.  He was already there, reading her mind, switching the window for her.  She hit the key to refresh that page too.More deaths.  Tattletale had broken away while the other Undersiders had ventured into the fight, and Jeanne had no idea why.  What was Tattletale doing?Her fingers knit together with Kurt’s, but backward, knuckles crossing knuckles.  The smooth surface of her ring grazed his finger.Holding her knuckles like that, he raised her hand up to his mouth and kissed her palm, then her wrist.“You’re worried about something.”“The Wardens didn’t ask us before they signed off on this, yet they have people devoted to idiotic things like rescuing people from time bubbles and loops.  Tattletale is maneuvering and I don’t think she has a good perspective when it comes to the big picture.  There are monsters like the self-styled Goddess out there.”“The Blue Empress of Earth Shin.”“Sleeper is still parked in Zayin.  I wanted to tell Gary Nieves that Cauldron capes are stable.  We have the power and we’re not as driven toward violence and drama.  We’re safe.”“Safer,” Kurt said.“Safer.  Yes.  None of the others are that safe.  They threaten to weaken us at a time we can’t afford it.  This idiotic business with the Fallen could leave us without enough people watching the portals.  Earth-C could attack and having critical people in an asinine fight could be what leaves us vulnerable.”“If you wanted it, you could seize the reins.  The others are down or out.  You could take charge and start making decisions.”Jeanne leaned back in her seat.  She surrendered her defenses, for one fleeting moment.  She gave Kurt a look, worried, momentarily insecure.Kurt was the only person she’d ever allowed herself to show that insecurity to.He leaned over and gave her a brief kiss.  He looked her in the eyes, and he said, “I know where you come from, Jeanne.  Somehow, I don’t feel like I’m a species of one when I’m with you.  Don’t doubt your ability to do this.”Jeanne smiled.⊙Jean slouched in her seat.  All around her, people were talking with lawyers, with parents, with family and friends.  There were only fifty girls at the institution, all wearing navy blue sweats, or sweat bottoms and white t-shirts.  Guards were stationed at points around the room.Every week, it seemed, someone left, and someone came back in.“Do you know who I am, Jean Brown?” the man sitting across from her asked.  He was young, but short.Jean shrugged.  “Someone my parents hired?”“I’m someone that hires, not someone who is hired,” he said.  “I own several businesses in Boston.”Boston.  She made the connection and immediately started paying more attention.  She sat up, gripping the seat with both hands to push herself up to a sitting position.“I’ve been made aware that you recently had an altercation with a girl from Boston.”“Yes,” she said.  “Yes sir.”“Tell me how that went.”What was she supposed to say or do?  Tell the truth?  Beg?He seemed like the no-nonsense type.  For perhaps the first time in her life, she decided to play things straight.“When they brought me in here, I was given the tour by another one of the girls in juvie.  They pointed out Lindsay.  They said everything had to get run by her.”“Phrasing,” he said.  “‘Get run’ is not proper English.”“What are you, my teacher?” she asked.  Reflex.He leaned forward, meeting her eyes with his.  “I may end up being one, Jean Brown.  Keep in mind that some lessons are more final than others.”She felt the thrill of terror as she heard that.  One of her hands slipped from the edge of the chair she was gripping and she adjusted her position in the seat, hands clasped together and pressed down into her lap.“Continue,” he said.“I didn’t want to run things by her.  She was telling us when we could get ourselves- when we could get commissary, and when we could go to the bathroom.  Right away, I knew I didn’t like her.”“This dislike and frustration led to you pinning her down, cutting her lower eyelid off, and lacerating the other eye?”  He arched an eyebrow as he asked it.“I would’ve cut all of the eyelids off without cutting the eye itself if she hadn’t thrashed so much.  Either way, I was placed in S.T. and they brought me out to see you.”“She was mine, Jean Brown.  She did me a favor and that favor led to her confinement here.  She interpreted one of my instructions too loosely, and that is why she was to spend the one year here before she turned eighteen and graduates out, instead of finding her way out right away.  She had a position waiting for her.  Now I have to figure out what I’ll do with her… and I have you to deal with.”Jean swallowed, and found it harder to swallow than she wanted.  She tried to look nonchalant.“She’s not the first person you’ve grievously injured.  You have several more years here and after that you’ll graduate to an adult prison to see out the remainder of your sentence.”Jeanne looked away.“Look at me.”She did.“I’ve noticed the pattern behind your actions here, and I’ve identified it as a desperate grab for standing.  It was crude, rising up by cutting people down.  You used a razor on a classmate’s face and attacked a teacher.”She hesitated, then asked, “Sir?”“Yes, Jean Brown?”“Can I ask why you’re talking to me instead of having someone hurt me like I hurt her?”“You may ask,” he said.When he didn’t follow up, she connected the thought, and asked, “Why, sir?”“Because, Jean Brown, I understand the desire to rise up and desperately make sense of a world that seems so senseless.  I read every file that can be found about you, and I don’t believe you ever had a chance to be civilized.”“Civilized?”“Please speak and inquire in complete sentences.  I know who your stepfather is, I know who your teachers have been.  Your judge remarked on your privileged background, but you were the last file he looked at after an overworked day.  He hadn’t had a vacation in five years and his retirement was imminent.  He was lazy and he didn’t see you.”Jean felt a thrill similar to the fear that had run through her earlier.  This time, however, it was at the realization that maybe this man sitting in front of her saw her, like the judge hadn’t.“A lawyer will take and appeal your cases.  Lindsay will change her mind about who attacked her, and your other cases will be addressed.  You will be out shortly.  You’ll get and accept a scholarship for a private school in Boston and then you will rise to the top of the class.  You will make no fewer than five friends of standing and class, and you will attend private tutoring classes after school that will round out your education in other things.”Her head spun with the paradigm shift.“This will be far more difficult than juvenile prison, and even more difficult than being a newly minted eighteen years old in an adult’s prison, Jean Brown.  You will want to do as I instruct, regardless of this difficulty.”She wanted to ask why, and her instincts told her that she couldn’t and shouldn’t.Failure wasn’t an option.“You get one chance, Ms. Brown.”⊙“Ms. Kiley’s polls are down,” Kurt said.“The spike was because of how closely New Brockton is affiliated with industry and construction.  It was always going to be short lived.  I think she knew it, when she walked away today.  Mr. Nieves is gone, Kiley is out.  Russel isn’t really trying.”“Leaving only Mrs. Songmin.”“She hasn’t attended any of the meetings or discussions.  She’s campaigning, but that’s all there is.”“She is a politician.  She knows how these things work.”“She’s a contender, but not a concern,” Jeanne said.  “I’ve never run for any seat or position, but I’m more of a politician than she is.”Kurt laughed, head going back.  The laugh echoed through the empty room.“You know it’s true.”“Oh, I do know.  I like how succinctly you put it.”“Being succinct was essential to surviving among the Ambassadors,” Jeanne said.“I did like Accord,” Kurt said.  “Peculiar, but he was an asset.”Two hours had passed, and neither of them had left the hall or their seats at the table, except to bring a cup of coffee to the table or to use the facilities.  The laptop screens glowed and the light from overhead was more mood than office lighting.  The rain poured.Hours ago, things had turned for the worse, in that localized war outside of New Haven.  Those things, to an extent, had little to do with them.  When they got back to their home and business, they would get the full update on the dead and lost.  Documents would be updated, and some plans would be shifted around.Every five to fifteen minutes, Jeanne checked news and cell feeds to see if there had been an attack from zealots or another crisis taking advantage of the distraction.  That possibility concerned her more than the death of Tattletale, the swelling of Fallen ranks by way of mind control, seizing most of the survivors, or any other hypothetical scenarios she might imagine.Kurt had fallen silent, as he checked his information.  His screen was a tide of numbers and account balances for several moments.  He refreshed a page, then turned his laptop for her to see.  With black text on a white page, and the room so dim, it was glaring, and her tired eyes had to adjust to interpret.“We found him.  The thief.”“If I found him, others might have too,” Kurt said.  He stood and closed the laptop.  The acknowledgement that they would have to act was left unspoken.Others.  Jeanne knew who they were.Jeanne stood as well.  Laptop closed and placed in a messenger bag, joined with the booklets and papers she’d brought with her in case more showed.There were no portals.  They couldn’t speak a word and request a doorway to any place or alternate earth.  The act of getting to the old headquarters was… arduous.  The way to the old Cauldron headquarters was to travel to Cote D’Ivoire and use the spare portal there.  It was easier to situate themselves in the city.Besides.  The old base had been commandeered.Kurt had his phone out and at his side, his thumb typing.“You’re requesting your brothers?”“The pair.  I’ll reach out to several of the employees.  It might be overkill to call in a favor.”“Worthwhile overkill if it helps us deal with him.”The car was waiting outside.  Every other car on the road was a dark shade or dark gray, but her sedan was yellow.  She had a weakness for finer touches like that.  She preferred to drive, but she acknowledged that it was better if Kurt handled it, for instances like this.  Again, the unspoken communication between them had him going straight to the driver’s side.He peeled out, with no regard to speed limit or the vagaries of traffic.Kurt spoke, “Friction, plus fifteen, one hundred feet ahead, in five, four, three, two, one.”She placed the effect of her power.  The car turned, wheels skidding.  The nose of the vehicle grazed the back bumper of a truck that was slower to make the turn.  She knew there wouldn’t be a mark.“Forty three minutes away,” Kurt said.  “With up to one minute added time for maneuvering around traffic.”So many things were reliant on resources.  Money- they handled money and they had money.  Kurt had arranged the trading dollar and he’d made it work.  A city couldn’t run on barter, and a megalopolis was far more involved than a city.People were another resource.  They had people, but it was scattered.  She had seen and worked out the state of Cauldron over the years, after taking over Accord’s position as head of the Ambassadors.  She’d known it to be a very large place with very little staff.  That much remained true now.  When they needed it, as they did now, they could tap their scattered group and make things happen.  It was the nature of their group and the people they collected that when they gathered together, they worked together like a perfectly engineered machine.Knowledge, they were keeping something of a handle on knowledge.  Information on friends, on enemies.  They still talked to Tattletale now and then because she was a prime source of knowledge, albeit of the uncertain sort.Things grew more difficult, past that point.  Time was a harder resource to obtain.Nine minutes into their trip, time and people converged as elements.  Kurt rolled down the back windows of the sedan.  The windows were barely rolled down when lithe forms slipped into the back of the vehicle, as it tore down a forty mile an hour road at seventy-five miles an hour.“Thank you for coming,” she said.“You’re welcome,” Kurt’s younger siblings said.  They’d cleaned up, and loosely matched Kurt in presentation, though they’d gone for something more fitting for teenagers.  Both wore the thick-framed glasses, however.Kurt became annoyed with them very quickly, so it had ended up being her responsibility to corral them and give them direction.If she ever had a doubt that she was Kurt’s type, the fact that his clones were so bad at hiding their fondness for her would have banished the thought.  It never failed to put a smile on her face.“Red vehicle.  Wind shear slow, type three, offset by three feet left.  Make it a minus five, whenever you please.”She produced a brief field to encompass the left side of a red truck, causing it to pull to one side.  Kurt navigated between two vehicles, her sedan centered on the dotted line as it squeezed between the two.  The red truck saw them and braked suddenly, pulling further to the side.  She canceled out her power before another vehicle could intercept it or the red truck could be forced off course.  Kurt picked up speed once he was clear of the gap.“Could you give the engine special treatment?  I know effects on moving things are hard to maintain, but I can keep the speed constant.”“Time is of the essence,” she said.She placed the power over the engine, focusing to get it centered.  Acceleration.“This would be easier if we had Fortuna,” she said.“She gave her all to get us this far.  It would be asking a lot, for her to give us the remainder of her years.  We’ll see ourselves the rest of the way.  She can live her life as she sees fit.”Jeanne privately disagreed, but she didn’t make a point with it.  Not with Kurt’s younger selves in the car.There was one more resource, time aside, that they were critically short on.  Not power, specifically; it looked as though she had a mostly uncontested path ahead of her to the leadership over Earth Gimel’s largest population.Powers, though?  Any authority over powers themselves would be dangerous in the wrong hands.  That kind of authority threatened to wipe away any kind of meaning when it came to money, people, knowledge or time.  She knew because she leveraged it.It was an arm’s race to maintain that leverage and it was ruin to lose it.Which led them to the thief, wheels barely maintaining the necessary traction on the road.  They’d started forty-three minutes away and they took twenty minutes to get to their destination.They came to a stop and the wheels of the car smoked.“He’s still here?” she asked.“He hasn’t owned a car in all the years we kept tabs on him, and I had systems set to freeze all transportation.  Knowing his usual habits, he’ll know something is wrong and he’ll be running out into hills.  More help is arriving.  We’ll save time if we wait.”“Who are we after?” one of the two boys asked.Kurt rattled off a series of numbers, for facial measurements and metrics.“We’ll go ahead?” the other boy asked.“Don’t stray far.  Go out that way,” Kurt said.The two left.“I never did that,” Kurt said.Jeanne smiled.“They’ve picked up other things.  I don’t know if it’s because they copy me when they see me or if it’s because they’re getting it in other ways.”“You should have studied more about powers,” Jeanne said.  “I think it’s the latter.”He frowned.“You seem annoyed if they’re dissimilar to you and you’re annoyed if they’re similar.”“I’m offended they exist,” Kurt said.“I like them.  I see them and I’m reminded of how I used to be.  We traveled similar journeys, didn’t we?  We were vicious once, and now we’re civilized.”“We’re still vicious,” he said.  “Good grooming doesn’t clean that slate, nor should it.”“Fair,” she said.  “Who are we waiting for?”“A handsome fellow known as Barfbat.”“I know Barfbat.  He took us out to eat, remember?  The restaurant had chickens in cages just outside the door.”“Was that him?  Right.  Well, speak of the devil and he’ll appear.”Barfbat winged his way down.  Tumorous, fluid-filled growths deflated and his wings retracted.“Hi Barfbat,” Jeanne said.“It’s nice to see you, Jeanne.  This is really it, Number Man?  I’m done?”“This will be the last favor we ask of you, and your contract from June 1998 will be considered finished,” Kurt said.“It’s about time,” Barfbat said.  “Decades of my life spent keeping a phone nearby.”“We’ve helped you out along the way, as payment for having you in reserve.  But time is of the essence.  Can you sniff out our man?  I think he’ll be scared.”Barfbat nodded.  A slit appeared down the center of his face, and then it parted in layers, each layer adding to a flower-like bloom that was a comprehensive nose that obscured eyes and ears both.  Tumors swelled and filled with fluid around his neck and shoulders, stretching out until the skin was transparent, veins standing out where the light hit them.He broke into a run, arms extending until he could use them to help run, and Jeanne and Kurt both followed.  As they reached the outskirts of the little town, they caught up with Kurt’s younger ‘brothers’.Barfbat had an augmented body, but Kurt and his brothers had efficient movement.  Jeanne was fit, she exercised and ran every day, and she could use her power to help traverse obstacles or reduce wind resistance, but it was still an effort to keep up.They caught up with the thief.  It didn’t take long.  The terrain was hilly, and that slowed their quarry more than it slowed any of them.‘The thief’ was a middle-aged eastern Indian man, forehead creased in concern.  He’d grown out a beard and his hair was long, tied into a knot at the back.  He dressed simply, ready for the outdoors.“Balminder,” Kurt said.The thief, Jeanne thought.  The Dealer.  He absconded with as many vials as he could take.  Kurt had said that along with Manton’s defection, it was one of a series of betrayals that led to Cauldron keeping their roster small and disconnected.Kurt waved the others back.  Barfbat and the two boys backed off, keeping a respectful distance, so the conversation would be quiet.“I make one mistake,” Balminder said.  “Less than an hour later, you’re here.”“We’ve always known where you were and what you were doing, Balminder,” Kurt said.  “The time has come.  You have a fair amount left.  Give it to us.”“You’ve hunted me for half a decade.”“We kept tabs on you for three years and hunted you for the last two.”“Why not take me right away, if I was so easy to find?”“Because, Balminder,” Kurt said, “You were plausible deniability and a scapegoat, if we needed one, and you were one of a dozen pieces we kept in play, as people who could be arranged to rescue Cauldron if it was ever lost, if we gave someone a power that gave them absolute control over us.  It was good to have some vials out there that would take concerted effort to find.”“It was a small supply,” Balminder said.“I know for a fact this ‘small supply’ was not exhausted.  You have some left over.  It should be a hundred and thirty to a hundred and forty vials.”“The number is zero,” Balminder said.  “They’ve been claimed.  I thought they were you.”“Zero is my least favorite number,” Kurt said, in an uncharacteristically dangerous voice.“Don’t kill him,” Jeanne said.  “We can get answers out of him.”“We know what those answers will be.”“We’ll ask,” she said.Kurt deferred, stepping back.“Claimed,” Jeanne said the word.  “Explain.”“By a man.  A month or two ago.  He called himself Teacher.  I didn’t even slip up, he just- he appeared.  And he had a small army of people with powers with him.”“A small army,” Jeanne said.  “It’s good to know.”“It is.  Thinkers and tinkers, Balminder?  Negligible powers?” Kurt asked.“Not just those.  Not negligible.  I know my powers, Number Man.  I know my shit.  This wasn’t trifling.”“Maybe not an Ingenue tweak,” Jeanne observed.“He has other avenues of access, then,” Kurt said.  “He has the old base, and what was empty is now fully staffed.  Now he has an army.”“We might have to revisit the truce we made,” Jeanne said.  “We thought the Undersiders knocked him down enough pegs that he wouldn’t recoup fast.  It seems he’s more resourceful than that.”“Teacher’s Cauldron,” one of the two boys said.“The Cauldron is fractured,” Kurt said.  “Like so many things.  We can’t afford the resources to mend the divide or deal with this army, small or otherwise.  The city would fall while our backs are turned.”It might fall nonetheless, Jeanne thought.  It was possible to do everything perfectly and to still fail, and try as they might, they wouldn’t get everything right.“We’ll take the city,” she aid.  “No use delaying now.  If he has Cauldron, we’ll take everything else.  If we take the city, we can control the Wardens.  If the Fallen come out ahead, we’ll control them.”“Um,” Balminder said.“You can come with us or you can go and keep your mouth shut,” she said.  “We’re a splinter of Cauldron, but we could count it as you coming back into the fold.”“We were never upset,” Kurt said.  “Not really.”Balminder frowned.“Think on it,” Jeanne said.She and Kurt walked a short distance away and let Balminder do his thinking.“You sounded almost as if you hope it will happen,” Kurt observed.  “The Fallen winning.”“Not hope.  But I think it’s more likely than not, so I’m planning accordingly.”“I don’t disagree.  Anything to deal with Teacher, is it?  Even deals with the devil.”                                                                                        Shadow – Interlude 5.y                                                                                        Jonathan held the diaper-clad zombie in his arms with a ginger care.“I understand not wanting to give it up.  This is something special,” he said.“We might not give it up.  We’re here about the price, so we can see what our options are,” the guy said.The couple Jonathan was talking to were fidgeting.  They were young- twenty-five or so, and the guy had tattoos up and down his arms, geometric, with Q-bert on one arm.  The woman had a cartoon character partially hidden by her sleeve.  As whimsical and bright as the tattoos were, they looked tired and worn out, and their clothes were somewhat washed out in color.“I had friends who were into preparing for the end of the world,” Jonathan said.  “Stockpiling food, guns, and learning survival skills.  They loved the zombie movies, naturally.”“I’m a fan too.  I never did the prep stuff though, except for having a chainsaw in our display cabinet.  I don’t know if that counts,” the guy from the couple said.“The scary movies we watch are always tied into the fears of the times.  As things got worse and the bad guys seemed to get ground, we got more zombie movies.  The inevitable demise.”“Absolutely,” the husband said.  “But whenever we had a movement like that, there was always a turnaround.  Things got better, didn’t they?  And when they did, so did the movies.”“Deconstructions, reversals, parodies.”“I liked the parodies,” the husband said.  He indicated the doll.  “Like Lenny.”“Second date,” the wife said.He glanced at his wife.  “Lenny there was an anniversary present.”“He’s great.  You shouldn’t give him up if he’s that important,” Jonathan said.“He’s important,” the guy said.  He looked at his wife again.  “But we can’t stay in the tent cities.  It’s more important that we have a proper house.  We’re selling a lot of the things we brought over.”Jonathan saw the wife pass her hand over her stomach.“Ah,” he breathed the sound.  “Got it.”“It’s hard,” the guy said.  “Silly as it sounds.”The man looked like he might cry, and it was because he was looking at selling a life-size doll of a baby with a bite mark in its middle and flesh missing from its snarling face.“I don’t think what the prepheads were doing ended up mattering, when the end of the world came.  The guns didn’t matter much.  Different sort of end to the world, they might have, but not here.  The food helped in the early weeks, but what really ended up mattering most was having the right mindset.  When the end of the world actually came it was a pretty heavy emotional blow.”“Yeah,” the guy said.“The people who seemed to do best weren’t always the preppers.  It was the people who could get back up after being hit that hard, and the ones with an idea of what to do when they’d been left with nothing.  It was better to have the right skills than the right things.  Having drive.  Preparing for the end of civilization… less so.  So long as there’s more than five people around, we’re going to have something like civilization.”“I think you’re right,” the wife said.  “I think it’s true for a lot of people who I’ve made friends with recently.  My sister wasn’t a prephead or anything, but she worried a lot about the Endbringers, and she spent all her money traveling to try to get away from where they might attack.  When everything finally fell apart, so did she.”Jonathan nodded.“She made it.  That’s what counts.  Hopefully- I’m hoping she figures out how to push forward, like you said.  There’s a world out there.”“I’m not trying to give you the sales patter, because that’s really not me,” Jonathan said.  “But if you’re prepared to sell something as important as Lenny…”He let the sentence hang a moment.“I am,” the husband said.“Then it’s good.  This stuff…”He indicated his shop.  The cartoons and figurines, the board games and video games.  Some things had a secondhand look to them, because they were very much secondhand.“…It’s not so important when we’re trying to put it all back together again.  Save it for when you’re secure, when you have everything you need.”“That’s the plan,” the husband of the couple said.Jonathan stroked the baby’s head.  “I could give you three hundred in trading dollars.  What do you think?”He could see the flicker of surprise on the man’s face.“The place we’re looking to buy an apartment in is using N.D.”“Then it translates to four hundred new dollars,” Jonathan said.  “It’s dying currency, be careful.  The value drops every day.”The husband fidgeted as he stared at the little life-size figure.  Jonathan couldn’t tell if he was doing it because he was about to break and try to find another way, or if he was trying to etch the figure’s details into his mind’s eye because he was about to give it up.Jonathan bit his tongue.  He was tempted to offer more, but he couldn’t.  As it was, he’d barely make back the money selling the figure, if he made any at all.  He needed to eat and pay for the store space.“We don’t have to,” the wife said.“We need to,” the husband whispered.“This isn’t a pawn shop,” Jonathan said.  “I’m looking for stock that certain people want.  I can’t hold onto things.  Be sure you want to give it up if you sell it to me.”He saw the husband frown, fidgeting more.“If you give it to me, and if I sell it, I’ll get the contact information from the buyer.  Somewhere down the line, if you want, you can talk to me, I can give you that information.  Maybe you can track it down and offer them enough to buy it back.  That’s the best I can do.”“Okay,” the husband said.  He nodded.  “Yeah.  Let’s do it.  For New Dollars, please.”Jonathan nodded.  He moved the articulated doll over to the nearest empty space on a shelf, then walked over to the register, popping it open with the painful metal-on-metal sound he hadn’t quite become used to.  He began counting out the money.“Can you handle this, babe?” the husband asked.  “I’m going to run an errand.”“Sure,” the wife said.Jonathan glanced up to see the guy walk away.Nothing was easy.“Is it hard?  Running a store like this?  It seemed difficult to run comic or games stores on the old Earth, and things are different now.”“It’s not the easiest,” Jonathan said.  It was an understatement; he had lost twenty pounds since starting the store, because he didn’t eat more than one meal most days, and some days he ate none. “My brother owned a store like it, in the old Earth.”“Is he helping you?” the wife asked.“He’s gone.  He- I guess he helped, my initial stock included some of the things I was able to get from his store.  He didn’t make it past Gold Morning.”“I’m sorry,” she said.“This place helps me feel a little closer to him.  I’m contradicting everything I told you guys, but this is what connects me to my loved ones the most.”“I don’t think that contradicts,” she said.  She rested one hand on her stomach.  “We’re doing what we can to hold onto those things most important to us.  Civilization wins out over madness.”“I think so,” he said.  He passed the money across the counter to her.  “Let me give you my number, in case you ever want to track it down.  And you can give me your name.”“An anniversary present for a year or two from now, if we’re lucky,” she said.He smiled.“Thank you,” she said.  She looked at his nametag.  “Jonathan.”“You’re very welcome,” he said.She left the store, and he moved the figure from the spot he’d given it to another place.Nothing was easy.  He hadn’t known what to say, so he’d spoken from the heart.  The things weren’t so important, it was being able to get up again.  That was what got him through the day.  He and his brother had lost their parents early on.  He’d lost his first job because a manager had shifted blame downhill, and he’d been blackballed from the local industry.  Forced to choose between moving elsewhere to find work and staying close to his remaining family, he’d chosen the latter.Now he had neither.  He pressed on.He helped some more customers, until a torrent of stern words from across the shopping center’s concourse turned his head.A red haired woman, berating her daughter.It made him uncomfortable.  It was a move away from the civilization and society he hoped things were trending toward.He retreated further into his shop.⊙The Fallen kid screamed as he smashed his chair against the invisible barrier.  Over the course of four impacts, he smashed it to pieces.He’d just relived the nightmare.  Everything, from his point of view, playing over again, with scattered context from elsewhere.  He’d seen fleeting glimpses of his brother, he’d seen the store, and he had heard the explosions.Then his world had turned upside-down and emptied out.  No store, no money, no peace and healing.He’d gotten out of the hospital and he’d made his way straight to the shopping center, using his new power to get past the tape and barricade.  Everything was gone, from the zombie doll to the boxes of cards and the crate of comics he’d liberated from his brother’s store.  There had been a comic in there that might have let him make an emergency payment on the store for a month, and now it was gone.Then he had keeled over early into a sleepless night, and he had relived that night.  Now he was here again.The boy with the glasses sat with his face in his hands, glasses pushed up.The woman had had a breakdown the first night and now she looked like she was going to crawl out of her own skin, fingers in her mouth, teeth biting down on flesh.And the Fallen kid -the fucking kid with the demon mask- went from railing uselessly against the walls of his cage to taunting Jonathan and the others.He kicked the dais in the center of the room.“Stop,” Jonathan said.The kid backed up, got a running start, and kicked the dais again, hard enough he should have broken his foot.“Stop.  You’re not going to do anything.”Grabbing the edge of the dais, the kid tried to shake it loose.“Stop!” Jonathan raised his voice.“He isn’t going to listen.  He’s a moron,” the boy with the glasses said, without raising his face from his hands.  “He wouldn’t wear that mask if he wasn’t.”“Fuck off,” the Fallen boy said.  “You don’t know anything about us.”“You assholes set a mall on fire and trapped us inside!  You were there at the door!” the boy with the glasses shouted.  “Fucking idiots, what were you even trying to do?”“You call us idiots, but we were right.  We said the world would end, and it did.  Now you’re all getting complacent again.  You still don’t listen to us, so we make you listen.”“People died,” Jonathan said.“Their fault, from what I saw,” the Fallen boy said.  He sounded sullen.  “Through your eyes.”The woman pulled her fingers from her mouth, and she screamed.  She slammed one hand against the invisible barrier, and she dragged her fingernails down the surface until Jonathan thought that one would be pried off.  She found her breath and screamed again.“Shut up!  Fuck off!” the Fallen boy shouted.She’d broken.  That she’d broken to the degree she had scared Jonathan, because he wasn’t sure how intact he was.He might lose it entirely if every night was like this.  This was only the second.They’d all seen into his head, through his eyes.  Was it random?  One random person every night?  An assortment of the things dropping out of the darkness above, distributed by chance?He looked at the dark fifth of the room.“You seem to be doing better than any of us.  Except maybe that asshole over there,” the boy with the glasses said.The idea surprised Jonathan.“I’m not doing okay,” he said.  “I feel-”His voice distorted on that last word, rougher, painful to make the word ‘feel’.“You feel what?”“I feel,” Jonathan said, in that painfully rough voice, “Hollowed out.  Numb.  Angry.  Lost.”“Yeah.  Me too.”“My voice-” he said.“It changed just now.”“It changed on the day.  Smoke inhalation.  I’m not wondering why it’s different.  Why was it normal?”The woman crumpled to the ground, hands up above her head, pressed to the wall, her head hanging.  The Fallen boy with his crude demon mask stood above her, looking down.  He didn’t say or do anything.“Maybe it’s catching up,” the boy with the glasses said.  “Why are we wearing the clothes we’re wearing?  Why is he wearing that mask?”Jonathan remained silent.Nothing had fallen from the sky.  He looked skyward, and saw only the darkness, the ceiling could have been twenty feet above them or it could have been a thousand feet above them, and he wouldn’t have known.He walked over to the dais, past barren shelves that echoed his shop with no usable stock.  He cast aside the debris and let it disintegrate.He found the shards of glass, and thought of the skylight.  Past the smoke, the light of the sun had been so bright on that day.  This place was so dark.He had extra shards today.  He held them up for the boy with the glasses to see.“Why glass?” the boy with the glasses asked.The answer was the same as it was for the other things.  It explained the shelves.It was him.  It was Jonathan’s, intrinsically.⊙His mover power let him treat any direction as down, with some nuance when it came to propelling himself forward.  He used it to ‘fall’ up to the top of a Fallen home.  His combat boots had enough gravel on them to crunch against the overlapping wooden slats.Love Lost was with Nailbiter and Beast of Burden.  That let Snag operate between Prancer and the Undersiders.  It was an awkward place to be, because both groups had a way of dancing around things, identifying their own things to do, but those things weren’t in alignment and their way of doing things once they identified a task was different.  Prancer tended to apply pressure, if he committed at all, and the Undersiders tended to surgically strike.Prancer wasn’t far, and the pressure he was applying seemed to be focused on pushing the Fallen out of cover and into the areas where there wasn’t much cover.  The area was the point where the settlement of buildings with each building next to the last was thinning out, and it became field and ditch, pond and forest, dotted with large farmhouses.  The Fallen in the farmhouses had guns, and periodically opened fire, which made it hard for Prancer’s offensive.  More Fallen kept showing up.Snag wanted to go and help, but Cradle was already there, Love Lost was somewhere nearby, prowling for stragglers, and the Undersiders were dragging their heels, talking and checking those who had been killed or injured, periodically kicking in doors and checking inside.Biter, Bitch, Foil, Parian, and Imp were all gathered together.Snag looked down and watched.  Two black stuffed animals, each twelve feet tall, were at the group’s back, as they walked down the street, checking doors.  The dogs were at the forefront of the group, sniffing.As they drew nearer, he growled, “Is this what we’re paying you for?  The fighting is that way.”“Blame her,” Imp said, indicating Bitch.  Bitch pushed her.“Protecting our asses,” Bitch said.  “Some might be in the building, and if we don’t check it’s clear, they’ll attack us from behind, whichever group we go after.”“Whichever group?”  Snag asked.  He stepped off of the roof and let his arms catch his weight before setting his feet down.She pointed back the way they’d come.  “South and east.  That way and that way.  Doon thinks there’s lots of scared people that way.  And lots more that way, of course.  North.  That’s the bulk of the fighting.”Toward Prancer’s group, with the fighting.“If they’re civilians and they’re staying out of the way, we can decide what to do with them later.  We leave them alone for now.”“I hope we leave them alone for good,” Foil said.“They’re Fallen,” Snag said.  “Civilian doesn’t mean innocent.”“You know our terms for helping,” Foil said.“I do,” he said.  And I know Tattletale’s are different.  “Don’t dawdle.”“Not dawdling,” Bitch said, her own voice becoming a growl.“Snag, man,” Biter said.  “Not worth it.  I’m biased, but these guys have some practice.  Let them do their thing.”Bitch spoke as if Biter hadn’t said anything.  “I’m covering our rear.  Against this many dangers, we can’t get surrounded and we can’t get caught off guard.  Doon, nose.”The mutant dog pressed its nose to the dirt.  It sniffed, and it huffed out a breath.  The other dog raised its head and brought one leg up, the joint pointing forward.“Good girl.  Show me,” Bitch said.Snag raised one arm as the Undersiders went ahead, and slapped a large mechanical hand against the forearm.  Gripping the arm, he rotated it until words lit up along the length.“Love Lost.  Cradle.  I’m at point B.  Points A, C, and O, roughly, have fighting, with H being the focus.  A and O might be civilian clusters.  Clearing B at Undersider suggestion, will move to H.”“Cradle here,” Cradle’s voice was distorted by the makeshift transmitter.    Snag raised a hand to get a better reception.  Cradle’s voice came through clearer.  “No sign of him.  Fighting’s bad.  Prancer won’t commit with this much gunfire.”“They have to run out sometime,” Snag said.  There was a series of two beeps, and he rotated his arm until a display came up.  The map, with points marked out.Love Lost had made her reply.  She’d found Fallen, further south.Off to the northeast, there was commotion, but it was too far away for Snag to intervene or act.  People fleeing into the trees.And the Undersiders- he snorted in impatience.He let himself fall forward, periodically touching ground for the reassurance of it or pushing off of the ground with a hand.  As heavy as he was in general, in the outfit he wore, the boots, and the arms that weighed a hundred and ten pounds each, he could feel the ease and flow of movement, the wind rushing through beard and long hair.  Power was at his fingertips both through the mechanical arms and the power that let him punch through inorganic things.His version of the Fallen kid’s power.He caught up with the Undersiders.“Drag marks,” Bitch said, pointing at the dirt road.Her head turned as she looked at a nearby house.“Coast is… not clear but not unclear.  Irredeemably weird,” Imp said.  Snag startled a little at the suddenness of the voice from his peripheral vision.“Weird?”“I asked Tattletale and she said it was one of the same people as yesterday.”Snag frowned.Foil held her rapier, with knives in her other hand, one knife poking up between each pair of fingers.  She took the lead.  Bitch followed.Only Biter and Parian remained.  Biter didn’t go in, and Parian remained behind with the stuffed animals and dogs.  Snag pushed the door open and followed the others up the stairs.He could hear a whispering and a rustling.  As he reached the top of the stairs, he could see past Bitch and Foil to the large cluster of black feathers, illuminated by light from the windows.  Four spindly black bird’s legs gripped nearby walls and floorboards.It spoke, but in a voice so quiet he couldn’t make out the words.“Sssh,” the bird thing made a sound, and the words that followed were like breath through rustling leaves.“Hey,” Foil said.  “Creepy.  I need you to back off and leave them alone.”Them?The bird-thing twisted around, until it peered at them with one large eye, the pupil misshapen, like the impression of a skull pressed into ink or mud.  As the pupil dilated, the shape filled out to look more like a face.Beneath it, Nursery, Magnate and a Fallen were lying in a heap.The bird-thing moved slowly, looking around the room.  There was a window to one side.Snag pressed two fingers against the center of his gauntlet’s palm.  He felt the vibrations as the inner cylinder rotated through his options.  He settled on the shuriken.  Scraping one finger against the palm, he set the loadout.  Paralyzing despair.  The arm throbbed silently to provide tactile feedback as it loaded the charge from the battery into the loadout of shuriken.The bird-thing twisted around more, curling up until it was condensed, instead of the broader form that had let it envelop three individuals.  Snag could see two smaller bird-limbs pull tight against its body as it withdrew that section into the center.  He could see clothes, and he could see hints of other things near that central core.“Step away from them,” Foil said.  “Trust me, you do not want to get on the wrong side of this rapier.”The bird-thing dragged itself closer to the window.“That’s fine,” Foil said.  “Who are you and who are you with?”“Tats said it’s the same thing as the screaming skull thing they described from yesterday,” Imp said.Snag tried not to startle at Imp’s sudden appearance, but the bird-thing did.  It jumped, lunging for the window, and Snag fired the burst of shuriken between it and the window.They exploded into a crackle of energy, intense enough that he could feel a trace of the effect himself.The bird-thing didn’t seem to care.  It shoved itself out through the window, past window-frame and glass.  It landed outside, as the group rushed to the window.Snag could have jumped out, but broken windows were dangerous.  He was reminded of the shopping center, of the corridor, with the skylight above, and the window he’d wanted the girl to crawl through.It wasn’t like the movies.  Even with his outfit, it was dangerous, and it looked like that thing was pretty fast.What was it doing here?  Did its presence mean the others were here too?A growl escaped his lips as he turned toward Nursery.  Foil was already checking her and the other two.“Alive.  Burned.  I don’t think that kid did it,” Foil said.“Kid?” Snag asked.“Tats said it’s a kid,” Imp said.“Based on what?”“Based on Tattletale,” Bitch said.  “We should hurry, clear the rest of the area.  Do you want to bring them?”“These two are allies,” Snag pointed.  “He isn’t.”“I’ll restrain him,” Foil said.  “Can you grab them, carefully?”Snag picked up Nursery, easing her around until she was over his shoulder.  He headed to the stairs.He felt nothing.  No compassion.  Nothing of the him he’d once been, that had cared for his brother.  In a way, it was easier.  Even on his worst, most frustrating days, it was easier to put the feelings away.  Dealing with people seemed easier when he could choose if he cared about them, and he only needed to care about a few.In another way, he hated it.  He hated what it represented.  That he had once had a tie to his brother, and he’d lost that family connection when, as he communicated with his brother on the phone over hours, the line had suddenly gone dead.  It had been by word of mouth, days later, that he’d heard New York had been hit.  Struck by a sweep of golden light.He’d tried to forge something in the shop, and the shop had gone up in flames.And the ashes, the memories, they had been stomped on, repeatedly, night after night, mixed with the memories of others, drowned out by a select set of events that were replayed ad nauseum.He switched to communication.  “Love Lost.  Cradle.  The heroes that have been plaguing Hollow Point might be here.  Be aware.”He adjusted his grip on Nursery.“Hey Foil,” Imp said.  “Parian.  You’re going to love this tidbit of news from our operations leader.”“Oh no,” Foil said.  “Me specifically?”“You have three guesses.”“Old teammates of mine.”“Okay, yes.  Vista and Weld showed up.  But that’s not it.  This is a lot more fun than that.”Imp sounded more sarcastic than her usual as she said it.“March.”“Geez.  You had three tries to get one right, and you got two right in two tries.  What’s the fun in that?”“Oh no,” Foil said.“You know March?” Snag asked.“Did you invite her?”“No,” he said.“Yeah.  I know her,” Foil said.  “She’s been after me since… forever ago.  She turned up in Brockton Bay twice, after the portal, before the end of the world.  She kidnapped Parian once.”“She wanted to recruit me, months ago.”“She collects multi-triggers,” Parian said.Cradle, Love Lost, and himself, then?Snag frowned.  “Let’s go.”⊙Snag was silent as he stared out at the other group.Everything had gone still and quiet as the small band of heroes, March, and March’s coterie approached from the settlement.  The Undersiders were circling around to talk to the heroes that had cut off the Fallen’s retreat, Foil’s old teammates included, and the battle lines held.March saw him, then saluted.He didn’t return the gesture.  His focus wasn’t on her.Every night, he dreamed.  Every night, he saw the others.  He heard them, and he talked to them, saw their reactions.Kiss and Kill.  He could understand it, even if the dreams were unique to his own particular group.  He knew these people as well as he might know any person he’d been married to for a year.  He spent hours every night locked in a room with them, separated by invisible dividers.What started as a seed of an idea became something more when his eye fell on the one with the hood, draping sleeves, and the faux-machine mask.The way he walked and held himself- the fact that his presence could explain both the presence of March and the inexplicable intervention of the heroes…“It’s him,” he growled.“What?” Cradle asked.  He sat on a mechanical hand, one leg dangling.“With the hood, near March.  It’s him.”Cradle had goggles as part of the suit that networked with his robot.  He adjusted one.“Be subtle,” Snag murmured.The Fallen were surrendering, now that their leader had been caught.  They seemed pretty reluctant to do it.  The various groups Snag had hired were talking among themselves, or figuring out what role they needed to play in this cleanup stage of things.  Nursery ventured into the no-man’s land, drawing closer to Cradle and him, because she didn’t have a role to play in this.  She had a bandage around her burns at her arm and leg.“Some privacy?” Cradle asked, looking down at her.“Hmm.  Okay.”“She can stay,” Snag said.“If you say so,” Cradle said.“What are you two murmuring about?” Nursery asked.“We found the one who killed Love Lost’s child,” Snag said.Nursery fell quiet.“We would like some time alone with him.  Which we can’t do, because this is wrapping up too neatly.”“It’s not okay,” Nursery said.  “I’ll help if I can.”“Thank you,” Snag said.“Don’t be an asshole like you were at the community center,” she said.  “You have more potential than that.”She sounded like she was his elder, talking down to him, when she was a fair amount younger.  She peered at him through the slash in the cloth mask that encased her head, cinched tight around her neck by the cord she’d wound there.  There was blood on the cloth.“You’re right.  This is wrapping up too neatly,” Cradle observed.  “It’s eerie.”Snag pulled his attention away from Nursery and the likely Fallen boy and the heroes he’d inserted himself in.He made eye contact with Secondhand, and Secondhand looked alarmed.  A moment later, the man disappeared.“Careful!” Cradle said, with alarm.At the center of things, where the Fallen had been using a farmhouse and the surrounding environs for cover, several of the heroes had disappeared.End of Days.Narwhal was slowed.  That would be Final Hour.  He could slow one target at a time.  Snag had helped him work on the frame that helped him apply a variety effects to those slowed.And Last Minute-Snag lunged, using his power.  He found a grip on one of Cradle’s limbs, and used it to reorient himself, trying to spot his target.Last Minute was short with a combination of muscle and fat that created a frame that made Snag think of the games store and time with his brother and his brother’s hobbies.  He was like a conventional fantasy dwarf, minus the beard.  The man had an arsenal of gadgets at his belt, and he’d already drawn some.Snag couldn’t get to him in time.  He focused on getting to cover.Last Minute wielded a shuriken design he’d learned from Snag, in exchange for a collection of data on lesser gadgets.  That exchange had included Last Minute helping Snag with the loadout chamber in his right arm.That weapon design, he knew what it did.“Take cover!” he bellowed.Last Minute threw.  The shuriken exploded, with a slight temporal effect applied to all within the area.  But he used his power in conjunction with it, and the explosions repeated, layering effects.Snag jumped.  Last Minute used a grappling hook to pull himself away.Betrayal.“Why!?” Snag roared.“Someone’s gotta represent the fourth,” Secondhand’s voice could be heard from the crowd.  Everything was dissolving into chaos.The fourth.The fourth Endbringer.  Khonsu.  A time manipulator and teleporter.They were Fallen?  Had they been all along?Snag roared, giving chase to Last Minute.  He had a mover power and his arms.  He knew Last Minute had a bag of tricks.A grenade here- Snag used his power to change direction in mid-air.  The grenade exploded, and the people near the epicenter were thrown away in fast-motion, their falls as they landed outside the bubble slower but harder for the lack of equilibrium.  Each one moved as it exploded, then exploded again.There were others, some decoys, some traps, others laying groundwork or sowing chaos, so the crowd of allies were a detriment to Snag.  Holograms appeared, repeated, forming clusters of two, three, four.He saw the boomerangs and shielded himself with his arms pressed together.He kept them there, as matching boomerangs time-looped to strike his arms over and over.“Focus!” Cradle shouted.  A mechanical hand pointed.  Secondhand was already across the battlefield, unloading his charge.  “Switch with me!”He’d leave the Speedrunner traitors to Cradle.He had someone else to go after.  The boy had been sent flying by Secondhand’s trickery.  The blast would have hit him hard.  He’d be reeling.Snag used his power to hurl himself back, nearly colliding with Nursery.The fight was turning the wrong way, now.  There was more gunfire, more chaos that served the Fallen’s ends.Snag let himself fall straight up, zooming up and away from the battlefield.  Rain pattered lightly against the side of his neck and his ear.  The exaggerated tactile responses of his gloves fed him details on each raindrop, more clear and real than his own body’s senses.The anger was crystal clear, and everything else was muted and cold.  A part of him had died in that shopping center, as a little girl slipped from his grasp, a doll he shouldn’t have bought from a couple for the amount he did burned, and everything stopped making sense.It hadn’t been a quick death, but the killing blow had been struck, and he’d gone hollow in the ensuing months.In the gloom, the Fallen shithole and the battlefield were small below, lit by tiny points of light.He controlled his descent, falling, but not at a velocity that would hurt him, not if his arms took the landing.Which wasn’t to say Snag intended to land gently.He dropped out of the sky, and he struck the ground with an overhead swing of both fists.  He narrowly missed making contact, as the boy threw himself back.  He thrust a fist forward, and the boy ceased moving back in mid-air, then resumed moving, to the side, instead.  The punch grazed him.The boy created curved silver blades in his hands, and swung.  Snag pulled back before they could reach.“It’s really you,” Snag said.“Offer stands,” the boy said.  “Help.  Look at them.  We can’t let the Fallen win.”“I don’t intend to,” Snag growled.  He took a step forward, and the boy threw one of the silver blades.  It crossed Snag’s mechanical forearm.His first thought was that it was like March’s power, drawing lines that then exploded at the endpoint.  There was no fuse, no sign of anything more to it.He pointed his other hand at the boy, and fired an emotion grenade.The explosion sent the boy sprawling, and forced Snag to put the hand with the line in it behind him, to steady himself.  He felt the tactile response, the metal scraping metal.  There was a line carved out of the arm, deep enough he could feel the air rushing in to graze the back of his hand, where it gripped a handle at the arm’s elbow.A time-delayed slash?“We’re resistant to each other’s emotion powers,” the boy said, as he climbed to his feet with a groan.Snag stood straighter, raising one arm to point it at the boy.  He used his damaged arm to spin the forearm, the loadout within switching through the weapons he’d packed into the arm.The boy tried to sprint to one side.  Snag aimed and fired a spray of needles, only to see the boy arrest his movement mid-step, then immediately reverse direction.  He created more blades and threw them.Snag used his own power to dash to one side.  He could see movement in his peripheral vision.  March’s group.He switched weapons, charging up a rocket with the battery, and fired it so it would land between himself and the woman with the rabbit mask.  The rocket soared high, and as he turned toward the boy, Snag chopped his hand down.  The rocket followed the motion, turning in the air and spiking into the ground before detonating on impact.Purple smoke filled the air around the impact site.It would buy him time.The boy had shitty versions of their powers.  He hadn’t shown his hand with the tinker power, or with the emotion one.Snag aimed, and he fired the last of the shuriken, no emotion loaded into them.  Wide-area spray.  They grazed the boy, even with the change of direction.He anticipated the silver blades and avoided them with a use of his power.He paused to catch his breath, watching his opponent, double checking that nobody was about to attack him from the flanks.  There was an odd chance he’d be caught by a stray bullet, but it wasn’t worth walking away from this for that.  Everyone was embroiled in the conflict.He was clear.  He could make this just about him and the boy.“For all your big words, you’re weak,” Snag said.“The only words I’ve spoken in the last six months have been pleas for mercy and cooperation,” the boy said.  “Innocents- the innocents fighting back there, they don’t deserve that.”Innocents.Snag turned to look.He switched loadouts, then aimed a hand back at the crowd.“No!”The boy charged him.  He turned to fire at the boy instead, and felt the silver blade intersect his arm again.He grabbed the boy around the head with his arm, felt two hands grip his arm, and with a wrench, tore the arm clean off.He used his own power to keep from falling, while the boy did hit the grass.  Shucking off most of the metal below the elbow, he reached down with both hands.Two ordinary hands gripped the mechanical arm, one silver blade flaring, then dying as it made contact.  Snag felt the divide in the metal, though integrity mostly held.His ordinary hand, reaching for the boy’s throat, was gripped by two smaller metal ones, narrow and spindly.“Give up,” he growled.“I can’t,” the boy grunted, straining.  “I have things I need to do.”The spindly metal arms creaked and popped as the metal broke under the downward pressure.  Cracks ran down the housing, and Snag was very aware of the flaws in the design.“I’m going to put the Fallen shit- unh.  Behind me.  I’m going to build something.  If you’d just… Let me!”Building something.There was a part of Snag that was horrified by the contrast, the inversion of it all.  That part of him disappeared into the noise, the screaming and the shouting, the conversations and the straining to hear the whispers.  Everything from the room that seemed like it would drive him mad and drive him further from the peace he’d once found, that never felt like it had truly stopped.He felt numb, and above all else, he felt so very tired.He wanted to end the Fallen boy in the same way his old self had wanted to put his head down to a pillow after a long, tiring day.It would be so easy, and… he’d be out like a light.Metal creaked and popped.The metal shattered, and Snag’s hand reached the boy’s throat.  He felt the pain in his forearm.Two blades had punctured his arm, in through the wrist and out the back.  His weight coming down made them move, turning the two wounds into one wider one.He pulled back, and blood flowed from the hole.  He tried to staunch it, but his oversized mechanical arm wasn’t designed to reach to something that close to him.With his hand numb, fingers refusing to work as they should, he tried to undo the catches that attached his oversized arm in place.  He dug one finger into the gap, and when he pried, it came free, the fingernail breaking, a trail left on the surface of his arm.Help.  He’d get help.  He turned-He felt the impact of the silver blade.  A line marked his body.Two more lines appeared, as the boy struck him.“Either let me help… or get no help at all,” the boy said.Snag twisted around.“Don’t move too fast.”Rainwater was pattering down around them.  Snag’s hair and beard were wet.“Let me help.  I have the things.”Snag didn’t move.  Water joined blood and trailed down his arm to fingertips, then joined mud.The first of the lines faded.“You could let me go,” Snag said.  “If you had any mercy in you at all.”“If I let you go, you’ll come after me again.”“Yes,” Snag said.He felt the faint tingle of the lines start to fade.  The boy hit him again.  Two more.  One at the neck.“No,” the boy said.Snag took a step forward.  With his second step, he brought his one intact arm up, and drove it down in a heavy punch.  The boy let himself be hit, only bringing his arms up to shield himself.The impact, dampened as it was, vibrated through Snag’s body.  He felt the line at his neck rupture.  The blood from his head and neck flowed down and out through the open wound, which extended from shoulderblade to clavicle.  With the blood, he felt his thoughts struggle, and he dropped to the ground.⊙He was back in the room.No dream to precede it.  No others.There was a surrender in the moment, as he stood there, and realized why he was there.Frustration peaked, and then dissipated.Anger flowed freely, then found it had nowhere to go and nowhere to settle.He was alone in the room, and for once, there was none of the chaos.  None of the jostling or noise, no babble, no overflowing emotion.He felt like himself again.No anger, no numbness.  He missed his brother, his store.  Was it that the connection had been severed, or that this mad quest had ended?  His time as a cape was over.  There was no going back.Light and shadow distorted, becoming vague impressions of people that clarified into the people themselves.  The Fallen boy was in his room now, bending down to pick up his chair.  The boy looked in Jonathan’s direction.“You really did it,” Cradle said.Love Lost appeared at nearly the same time.  She approached the dais with a quick stride.  She met Jonathan’s eyes, looked down.Jonathan touched the wounds of his arm, his wet beard.  There was no pain as he touched the wound at his neck.The light in Jonathan’s fifth of the room dimmed, then returned to its normal strength.“I don’t get it,” the Fallen boy said.  “I don’t see why you’d die just to hurt me.”“I hope that by the time she and I get to you, you will get it,” Cradle said.“Cradle,” Jonathan said.  “The way we’re going about this-”The lights dimmed as he spoke.“I can barely hear you, Snag,” Cradle said.“It’s not worth it,” Jonathan finished.  He looked at Love Lost as the lights dimmed, strengthened, then dimmed more.  “It’s not worth it.”“We can’t hear you, Snag,” Cradle said.The Fallen boy looked at Snag, then looked down.  There was blood on his hands and clothing.Interesting, the things they brought and didn’t bring into this space.  Love Lost had her mask and outfit, but not the claws.  Cradle was always mundane, always with the scratched glasses.Objects dropped from above.Three pieces of glass, striking the pointed peak of crystal at the center of the dais, bouncing off unpredictably.Two landed in the Fallen boy’s space.  One landed in Cradle’s.  Love Lost ignored them, didn’t even glance at them.  She stared across the dais at him, trying to see him in the growing darkness.She reached up to her mask, and she undid it, pulling the clasp free.She spoke, her voice disused and broken by a throat raw from screaming, “Rest, Jonathan.”He opened his mouth to reply, but he knew it would be useless.“We’ll get your revenge,” she said.“No,” Jonathan said.  “It makes us into monsters.”“No,” the Fallen boy said, echoing him.  “This… it isn’t worth it.”She did up the clasp, glaring at the Fallen boy.“I hope I’m not going to wake up to find my throat slit,” Cradle said.The lights and shadows distorted.  The three others left the room.Snag felt cold fear seize him.  He approached the dais, and found his space empty, devoid of litter, of glass, of anything else.He bent down, searching the space below the dais.  He’d discarded things last night.  Was there anything?  As he got closer to the dais, he felt both sides of the invisible wall converging.The other three areas were growing dim, going dark as the barrier faded.The lights went off, the barrier went down, and he gained something of an understanding of what, not who, was in the fifth space, that had been between his and the Fallen boy’s.With that knowledge, he slipped into dreams of a different sort, knowing that even if they paused or were broken up by visits to the room, there would never be an end to them.                                                                                        Pitch – 6.1                                                                                        Capricorn’s weight tore him out of my grip, helped by the fact that I was lost enough at recent events that I’d almost forgotten I was holding him.He fell ten or so feet and landed in a wet field.  The field was set on a slope and he slid a few feet before his feet found traction.  Ahead of us, Love Lost had already slumped to the ground.  Nothing to do with the fact that I’d hit her- everyone in Rain’s cluster had dropped.I could try as hard as I was able and it was insignificant, whether it was holding onto Capricorn, talking to Ashley, or hitting Love Lost.  It didn’t feel like I was having an impact on things, and I’d cornered and help catch Mama Mathers, the one in charge.I liked things when they were simple.  I could pick the biggest or most important target, remove them from the equation, and things would be better.  It was what I’d done with Mama.  It was what I’d done with Valefor, smashing his face in.It was harder to justify causing that kind of damage to Mama Mathers, when we’d needed her for a trump card against the greater conflict, and when so many long-duration powers kept running when the user was incapacitated or killed.Not that it had worked.  The Speedrunners had her and were escorting her to safety, the hostages were now both hostages and hostiles at the same time, and the fighting was more vicious than it had been before.“Get Rain,” Capricorn said, below me, barely audible over the shouting and the echo of ceaseless gunfire.“On it,” I heard Sveta, just as I started to fly.Her handling it was faster and safer than me taking action.  I dropped from the sky to land beside Tristan, crouching to use the slope for some measure of cover.“In over my head,” Tristan murmured, not hunching over so much as he slid down, resting against the slope with his arm back to prop himself up slightly.“You mean the scale of this?” I asked.“Yeah,” he said.“Yeah,” I said.  I had some more exposure to the really bad stuff than Capricorn did, but I could sympathize.  I’d seen something like this with the Slaughterhouse Nine, but I hadn’t been there for the duration of it.  That situation had been fewer individuals, but the individuals had been worse.  In both cases, it kind of made things easier.I’d been there for Leviathan, but that didn’t really translate to a small-scale war.Sveta returned.  A moment later, she dragged Rain to us.  I pulled Rain close, and reached beneath the collar of his outfit to touch my fingertips to his throat.“Alive,” I said.Something exploded nearby.  Damp ground was sent skyward, and joined the rain in pattering down around us, speckling everything.Sveta turned her face skyward, rain running down face and the curling leaves or tentacles of her mask.  She hadn’t collected or put on her wig again, which made her silhouette seem incomplete.  In contrast, I hunched over slightly, my hood keeping the rainwater out of my eyes.“I know I’m kind of the leader,” Capricorn spoke, his voice quiet, “But I can’t think straight like this.”“I know,” I said.  My eyes scanned what I could see of the battlefield, while my back remained to the worst of the fighting.  March and her group had backed off, the heroes were holding position at the woods to our left, and the Fallen were gathered across two farmhouses and the surrounding structures and fences, the two big buildings about two hundred feet apart.  They were using them for cover, and as a place to drag their wounded.Prancer’s group was having a harder time, further north.  They had some vehicles they’d used to approach this area, but battle damage had rendered the vehicles immobile, and the trucks and cars didn’t offer much when  they were trying to protect themselves from both hero and Fallen.  Compared to the defensive line that Vista and Narwhal could provide, and the actual structures the Fallen had, the vehicles weren’t much, and the group had to work to huddle in the half-circle of vehicles.Not that we were in a better situation.The Valefor-controlled hostages filled the space between it all.  The group was shrinking as hostages charged after one group or another and were incapacitated or trapped.“If we don’t have a plan I want to go to Weld,” Sveta said, quiet.  Her expression was grim, her face paler than usual in the gloom, damp with water.“It’s a plan,” I said.  I tried to sound confident.  “We go to the heroes.  We back them up.”Sveta nodded.Capricorn twisted around, looking at the situation behind us and to our right, where the heroes were.  Orange lights began to flow across the gap, like fat, lazy fireflies.Guillotines of ice or hard crystal flew from the heroes’ side into the mass of hostages.  The guillotines weaved between the hostages, avoiding them, and slammed into the farmhouse the nearest group of Fallen were using for cover.  A moment later, the guillotines disappeared, and the section of wall sagged without breaking.Narwhal’s forcefields.The Fallen cape with the horse’s head mask or helmet was facing Narwhal head-on, again.  He created shadow duplicates, and they struck out at the forcefields as the things hurtled past or toward them.  The effect was minor, changing the courses of the fields slightly, but as each construction tore past them, cleaving shadow duplicates in half, seeming to even hit the source of the duplicates, the guy persisted, and he produced duplicates faster than the fields cut them down.Other capes in Narwhal’s group were turning focus onto him, and yet he was staying in the fight.One of the lieutenants or leaders of a sub-family, it seemed.Capricorn’s wall snapped into place, blocking my view.  We hurried along it, using it for cover against gunfire, with Sveta lunging ahead to the far end of the wall with Rain in one of her arms.  Capricorn lagged behind some, but he had to travel on foot.We reached the treeline.  Two capes knelt by Rain.“It all went to shit,” a cape I recognized as Fluke reported.“I noticed,” I said.I heard a grunt from Bay, a cape younger than me with a tower shield, and saw him struggling.  A shadow duplicate of the horse-head Fallen was perched on his shield, reaching down to grab him by the helmet.  Bay’s mask was meant to open, but the jet black form of the heavyset Fallen’s shadow was gripping it, holding it closed, and making his weight fully apparent.Another cape blasted him, and he dissolved into wisps of shadow.I moved to a tree I could use for cover, and assessed the situation.  I could see a shadow become not-shadow, at the same time the real Fallen became shadow.  He could swap places with any of his active shadows, and he was able to make them quickly, with those zig-zagging cords of darkness.“Sveta,” I said.  “We might need you to do the flag trick.”“Against a human?” she asked.  “I’d hurt or kill him.”“You don’t have to, but-”Two more duplicates appeared.  The cords of energy were dense enough near the frontline that it seemed like he could create duplicates near us at will.“It’s Seir!” Narwhal called out.  “He had a kill order.  If you’re willing to kill, this is a time it’s okay!”Seir.  I’d heard something about him some time ago, but not in the context of his powers or position in the Fallen.  The Mathers family kidnapped people, and Seir had taken a kidnapping victim for a ‘wife’, to use a loose definition of the term.  She was one of the ones who had escaped, and her story had been one of a few things that had marked the turn in the wider public perception regarding the Fallen.  After that, and some similar stories, the public and started to see them less as detestable pranksters and more as the horrific cult they were.And from what little I could remember of her story-“He deserves to die,” Rain said.“Okay,” Sveta said.  Quieter, she said, “I don’t think I can bring myself to kill again.  I’m sorry.”Bay was being harassed again.  Narwhal was flanked by two copies, and a cape used a tinker gun to obliterate one while narrowly missing Narwhal, while a forcefield appeared in a position that bisected the other.Bullets hit trees and pinged off of the forcefields Narwhal had created to give the heroes cover.  Each time a forcefield was hit, it briefly became brighter, the edges and lines standing out in bright purples and blues.“I think the cords are counting as living tissue!” Vista called out, from a point in the group of heroes I couldn’t immediately see.Behind Seir’s living self, Imp appeared.  She jabbed out with a taser, and she touched only the shadow that he left behind.  It swung a punch, and she ducked, backing away as four of the ten active shadows turned on her, surrounding her.The Undersiders were here.  I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.Capricorn’s walls sprung up just ahead of where Narwhal’s forcefields were, and she canceled the forcefields.“Thank you!” Narwhal called out.  When she went on the offensive, it was with more fields and projectiles, less intent on Seir himself, and more intent on cutting through the cords that arced up into the air and down into the ground.  Seir’s numbers began to decrease.A localized storm of power came tearing at us from an angle, like a tornado, but less of a cone and more of a sphere, with a bright green tint toward the center.  Narwhal had to stop her offensive to layer forcefields between herself and the sphere.One of Parian’s stuffed animals marched out into the field just beyond the trees, and was immediately swarmed with three Seirs.“I know I should, but-” Sveta said.“It’s fine,” I said.  After Ashley, I wasn’t about to push Sveta to test a boundary.  I hadn’t known Ashley’s boundary had been as tenuous as it was.  I had more of an idea with Sveta.  I wanted to jump into the fray, but I wasn’t sure what I could do.Rain groaned, to my right.  I turned my attention to him- one cape was helping him to stand.“Do you know Seir?” I asked.“He’s an asshole,” Rain said.“We can’t seem to touch him.  He just dodged an attack from behind,” I said.“What color are his eyes?” Rain asked, too battered and out of it to really stand or focus on the fighting.“Yellow,” Bay called out.“He teams up with another cape in the family, they’ll be someone in the background with glowing eyes.”Narwhal began attacking with a different angle, aiming at one of the farmhouses.  Seir’s real self twisted around to look.Rain filled us in, in a voice that made it obvious he was still hurting from his fight with Snag.  “That’s Ahrima.  She gives him danger sense and boosted perceptions by giving up hers.  She was supposed to be one of Mama’s helpers, she traded and paid for capes who could protect her if she needed it, but Ahrima didn’t work for her.  We still kept her around for others.  Get him while she’s distracted.”Narwhal’s focus was on keeping the thinker-augment Fallen on their heels.  I looked at the battlefield.“Vista!” I called out.  “Open space to the right!  Keep gunfire away!”“Yep!” I heard.I took off.  I flew low to the ground, my soaking wet costume making me feel heavy enough I might be pulled down into a crash landing, even though it wasn’t that big of a difference.As I approached, I could hear the gunfire and see the bullets hit mud, with the occasional eruption of dirt appearing off to the side.  Where the light hit the rain in the right way, I could see the odd slant of rain, and I knew Vista had my back.I used the clear route to get as close as I could to Seir before I changed course and flew at him.Fighting on the ground meant using footing to get the most out of one’ strength.  A punch delivered from a stance with bad footing was ineffectual.Fighting in the air meant using the same techniques one did with a leaping or jumping attack, with whole body movements, use of weight, but it was a constant use.  Delivering an effective attack meant using twists and whole-body rotations, downward or forward force, and timing all movements of the body to work with the flight and where the enemy was at.I was out of practice, but I was reasonably happy with how I delivered my kick.I was less happy that he looked past the eyehole of that hideous horse mask with glowing yellow irises and he turned to shadow the moment before my kick caught him across the small of the back.My kick tore through his shadow’s midsection, and the upper half reached out to catch me by the throat with shadow hands.  It had no lower body, and it was keeping up the fight.Ahrima had given him a bit of help at the right moment.I hadn’t wanted to use the Wretch to hit Seir when Vista couldn’t necessarily protect me.  Now?  I could use it like this.  I let it unfurl, expanding out from me to cover me and extend into my immediate surroundings.  Teeth, legs, arms, hands, feet, without much in the way of rhyme or reason.Fuck you for making me do this, I thought, and I pushed my aura out hard.The Wretch tore through the shadow and several of the surrounding channels of Seir’s dark energy.The Wretch and I began to go on the offensive, adding to the pressure on Seir by removing shadow duplicates and cutting off his power before it could extend too far out.A bullet hit the Wretch, and I felt it disappear.Seconds passed, where the painful weight of the Wretch was lifted.  The danger of the gunfire and powers around me paled in the face of the danger of the feeling.  It was deceptively exhilarating to have the Wretch gone, no longer available at a heartbeat’s notice.  I knew it was temporary and how temporary it was, but when everything else was so heavy, just that one deceptive moment caught me off guard.I continued to go after Seir, chasing his real self in a mad, dangerous game of whack-a-mole, where the mole always won and the person with the hammer could be shot at any moment.  The Wretch returned, and a well-timed punch from a shadow Seir destroyed it a moment later.The yellow eyes weren’t there all of the time, or even ten percent of the time, but Seir was evasive, capable of creating doubles and swapping places with them constantly.  He didn’t need danger sense to give us a one in twelve chance of hitting the real him.Others were joining the fight now.  A Fallen cape or one of the bikers was approaching, grown tall, his flesh alternating between something that seemed hard, like calcified armor plates, and flesh that seemed too soft and fluid.  Another was approaching with arms raised above her head, and she seemed to be the source of pitch black circles that were now dotting the landscape and air around us.I just needed to tag Seir at the same time the danger-sense cape was distracted.  I needed to do it soon, before he had help.Forcefields flew past me.  Narwhal.  The forcefields that didn’t hit Seir’s copies arrived between us and the Fallen capes, then stopped on the spot and rotated, forming a wall of crystal to bar their path.I heard the impact as the big cape hit the crystals, and I saw the colors flare, brighter than they had when the bullets hit them.  The portal cape was running around to try to get around the wall, and was stymied when the wall moved with them.I destroyed two more shadow copies.  A projectile I only barely saw destroyed another two with one shot.We’d reduced it down to three Seirs.  I went after one before more duplicates could spring into being, hit it, and reduced it to tufts of shadow.The big guy battered through Narwhal’s shield.  He broke into a run, long limbs stretching and heavy feet pounding against the ground, charging me.A forcefield hurtled into him, but this forcefield had a passenger.  Narwhal rode it, and she leaped off as the big guy caught the slice of crystal.  She landed, and her hair was still settling around her when the forcefields sprung into being to her left.I punched another two Seirs, well aware I was fighting an uphill battle.They had formed so each forcefield was a foot apart, and the stack of forcefields overlapped with the fluid armor brute, dividing him neatly into roughly eleven slices.But the distraction had bought Seir time to make more doubles.  With yellow eyes glowing, he evaded the moving forcefields and changed just before new forcefields could cut him in half.Two more Fallen and one biker joined the skirmish, jumping onto the black portals, which served to send them flying into the next black portal.  Each portal was a kind of teleportation gimmick, but they littered the area and were letting the Fallen maneuver with ease.  I saw their eyes glow like Seir’s did, and their focus was mostly on me.That focus was partially by design.  My aura still blasted everyone nearby, and that drew their attention.Still… fuck this.“Narwhal!?  Can I leave you!?” I called out.“Go!”I flew away from the scene.  I looked back, saw Vista, and saw her give me the go-ahead.Ahrima was my target.  I knew her general location, and she was too dangerous as a force multiplier.I heard a series of gunshots nearby, and changed direction.  The first gunshots didn’t hit me, because Vista was altering trajectories, but as I spotted the shooter, I saw them firing recklessly, putting bullets in the air at random.  By pure luck, the shooter was able to land one shot and hit the Wretch.My change of direction made me harder to track.  I flew back and down, touched the ground, and flew toward the sound of the gunfire, trying not to move in straight lines.  I saw the cover they were hiding behind and flew around it.Staying low to the ground, I felt the Wretch re-emerge.  Limbs and digits dug into the ground, and tore up the earth below me.  My aura roared, the dirt flew around me, and I was within the center, cold and angry.The shooter had been peering over cover, but the sound of the Wretch carving its way through the ground drew their attention.  They turned my way just in time for me to get in their face.I swatted my hand through the air, and the Wretch followed suit.  The difference was that my hand hit air, and the Wretch hit the shooter’s gun hand.The gun was torn from their hand and sent flying into the dark, wet field behind the shooter, and several of their fingers were broken in the process.I hated guns.I changed course, flying out toward Ahrima again, rising higher as I did.  I could see the rank and file Fallen soldiers, and I could see the Fallen with powers.  There was a concentration that suggested they were defending a car.I flew at the car, and given how my course went from the shooter I’d disarmed to the vehicle, I approached at an angle where they weren’t really expecting trouble.  It let me hit the roof of the car with the Wretch, tearing it off, and between the flying pieces of roof and the aura, Fallen were left ducking for cover.I saw the girl who could only be Ahrima, eyes glowing yellow, her demon mask featuring an eye on the forehead.  She was roughly Kenzie’s age.My hesitation cost me.  Fallen rallied, and soldiers opened fire.  I spun in the air and spiraled down, and not because I was delivering a heavy hitting attack from the air.  An intense pressure caught my arm, and my first thought was that a power had made a black hole open up in my bicep, with the muscle, bone, and skin being sucked into it.I landed in the mud, the pressure mounting in my arm.  I shut off my aura, because I didn’t need to draw attention to myself when I didn’t know for sure what had happened.My heart beat, and the beat was hard like a hammer hitting concrete, and between that beat and the next, I felt the first hint of pain and realized what had happened.Just a normal bullet.  I retroactively strung the events together in my head.  It had been a burst of fire from something that wasn’t a hunting rifle or pistol, three shots, all at once, and Vista hadn’t been able to curve the shots away from me.  One shot had hit the Wretch, and one had hit me.I remained where I was for a moment.  While I had the benefit of shock to dampen the pain, I needed to figure out my next step.I was surrounded by Fallen, I needed to deal with them before Ahrima.If I was a cop, dealing with people with weapons, it would be okay to shoot first.These guys had weapons and worse.My rules weren’t like Sveta’s rules.  She never wanted to hurt anyone again.  I wanted to only hurt people if I thought it through and if it was right, lawful, and if I wouldn’t regret it.Fallen were circling the vehicle, approaching me, and I flew at them.  My aura helped to slow their reactions as I bowled into them.The collision hurt the soldiers.  My attention was on the masks in the group.  I needed to go after the ones with powers.I saw the first one, and I flew at them, fingers dragging against skin until I touched a strap.  I grabbed it, brought out the Wretch, and used the Wretch’s strength to toss them skyward.Bursts of strength, letting the Wretch start to emerge, but not letting it unfold to its full breadth, reach, and intelligence.I flew to intercept and brought out the Wretch for a moment, so their legs would hit the Wretch or hit my invincible self as they descended. If I didn’t break their legs or feet outright, I would at least make it so they couldn’t walk for a good little while.My arm throbbed.  Each time I became aware of the pain, it was doubly worse than before.People backed away and used the car for cover against me, and I threw myself at the car.  I pushed it along wet dirt driveway and I pushed it into the group.Not that effective, but it did make them relinquish their cover, backing up and spreading out.  They had guns, but they didn’t fire.Ahrima was still in the car, which still had its roof torn off.  She slumped in the driver’s seat, draped over the wheel.  Shooting at me would risk shooting her.I hadn’t intended that, but I wasn’t about to complain, either.As a deterrent, it only worked against one select group of people, though.  Prancer’s group opened fire on our area, and a bullet hit the hood of the car.  Mud sprayed as a bullet hit the ground near the Fallen group, and they took that as an indication to retreat toward the house.I flew to pursue, and someone in the group used their power while the others ran.A beam, or a column of energy, transparent.  It enveloped me, and my forward movement stopped when I was only a couple of feet from the group.  I could fly side to side, and even slip out of the column of energy, but as it centered on me again, I couldn’t fly toward the source.That black-hole pressure in my arm made it feel like the muscles in my shoulder and forearm were being twisted up and wrenched into the wound.  I pressed a hand against the approximate location of the bullet, and blood oozed between the fingers.I flew straight down, Wretch out, and I hit the ground with all the strength I had.  The person shooting the beam lost their footing, found it, and centered the beam on me again.Even with the Wretch taking the impact, the vibration and the shift in position doubled the pain in my arm.  For an instant, I wished I could pass out and be relieved of it.Other thoughts flickered through my mind, almost in the same way that idle thoughts ran through one’s mind while they drifted off to sleep.  These weren’t restful thoughts, though.  It was the people writhing on the ground, and the old conservative woman I’d rescued.  It was the graffiti in Hollow Point.I almost collapsed into that sequence of thoughts in a confused, angry haze.  I didn’t.  As I rallied, I felt my thoughts clarify with the images.I couldn’t approach while the beam was locked on me, and I could feel other kinds of pressure mounting, like the head-rush from doing a handstand, but concentrated in my shoulder blades, back, buttocks, calves and feet.I did as I’d done when Amy had pursued me, after the barbecue.  I swung, and I let the Wretch hit the ground.  Dirt and mud sprayed into the air and sprayed toward the cape with the beam.The beam kept the stuff from flying into them, but it didn’t stop the clumps and clods from arcing up and over the beam, landing on and around them.For a moment, they were blinded and left stumbling back by the force of the mud slapping against them.It was a Fallen woman with a mask that hid most of her eyes and left only the mouth visible.  Her costume was molded to the body, erasing lines and features in favor of more smooth rubber expanses of ‘flesh’ like the ones around the eyes.  Only a few isolated symbols and words were carved into the rubber ‘flesh’, painted to be red and angry-looking.I grabbed her by the rubber between her breasts and lifted her up into the air.  One-armed, I heaved her around and rammed her into the car’s hood, hard enough to knock the sense out of her.A demon loomed in my vision.  I tensed- and I saw the demon reach down to the beam demon, applying the taser.Imp.  She was the one who had knocked out Ahrima.  She leaned back, settling into the car’s passenger seat.Right.“We had the same idea,” Imp said.  “Go after this one.  I was quicker, y’know.”My arm twisted in pain.  I looked back, and I saw that Seir was dealt with, as were his reinforcements.“Oh, you’re hurt,” she said.I wasn’t up to talking, so I gave her a curt nod instead.“Go get yourself looked after.  I got her.  We got her, since you saved me the trouble of having to find out who had the car keys.”I winced, in part because of the pain, and in part because it was another thing where it felt like actually changing the course of this greater thing was hard to do.I’d broken the Fallen ranks, at least.  I’d stalled Seir and then played a part in Ahrima being disabled.  I’d have to console myself with that.I gave Imp another curt nod, and flew back in the direction of the others.Capricorn had been busy, raising walls between the various fighting factions.  It was changing the flow of the fight, and for better or for worse, the Fallen were focusing on Prancer’s group because it was the easiest to hurt.Weld had reunited with the others, and the other Undersiders, March’s group, Narwhal’s squad with Vista included, and my team were all together, hunkered down by the wall.  I landed, and I dropped to one knee when it turned out my legs had surprisingly little strength to them.Sveta and Rain were talking to Narwhal.  Sveta glanced at me, shot me a smile, and then returned to the conversation.I was aware that March and Parian were talking, further away from the wall and the group.Given where I’d landed, it was really Vista and Foil who noticed and approached me.  Foil saw the blood, and dropped to my side, reaching to her belt for basic supplies.“Thanks,” I managed.She glanced back at Parian and March, then turned her full focus to my gunshot wound.  The wound sucked at my fingers as I pulled them away from the bloody mess.Vista waved somebody over.  The wave got Sveta’s attention, and she   hurried to a spot behind me, where she could support me from behind and look over my shoulder.“Sorry,” I said.  “I got reckless.”“My fault,” Vista said.  “I couldn’t get something up in time.”“I didn’t leave enough of a gap between me and the people with guns.  Nothing you could do,” I said.The hero from Narwhal’s group had a first aid kit.“That could have hit the artery,” the cape said.  “This is something we can patch up, but you’re going to need more attention later.”I nodded.  “Thank you.”“You’re leaving?” Rain asked, voice carrying.  I followed his line of sight and saw March collecting a bag as her coterie gathered in a group just behind her.She answered him, “It seems I’m not welcome here.  I’m leaving these guys alone, but I’ll be around until this thing is done.  We’ll talk.”“Okay.  We’ll talk.”March saluted, made a sound like she was chuckling under her breath, and ducked beneath a branch as she headed further into the woods.“Good riddance,” Foil hissed under her breath.  In a different, softer tone, she said, “It’s been a long time, Victoria.”“It has,” I said.  I didn’t like how my voice sounded, but I couldn’t devote the focus to sounding more like a proper wounded superhero. “You doing alright these days?”“Present mess and end of the world aside?”I smiled when I probably shouldn’t have.“Yeah.  Surprisingly alright,” she said.  “You?”I turned to look at my injured arm.“Present situation aside?” she asked.“Others said you were invulnerable,” Bay said.“Ran into a power dampener earlier,” I said.  I turned my head to look over my shoulder at Sveta, who had her hands on my shoulders.  “It might have played a role.”“Probably did,” Sveta said.I turned to Foil, looking to change the topic, “What’s the story with this March thing?”“Long story.  We’ll talk later, but- not in polite company,” Foil said.I nodded.  The aborted conversations were rough, when I wanted any conversation at all that could take my mind off the pain.Capricorn, not in my immediate field of view, reported, “Threw up some walls.  Prancer’s not having a good day.”“Stupid to attack like he did,” I said.  I watched as Rachel Lindt emerged from the deeper woods, a mutant dog behind her.Rachel Lindt was not my favorite person, but Vista raised a hand in a wave, and Rachel returned it, her expression dour.  I could let this particular sleeping dog lie, if Rachel was willing to do the same.“There’s more to the attack than it might seem,” Foil said.  “The Fallen are growing too fast.  Thinkers, Tattletale included, concluded they were about to connect with some other groups and lock  up a bigger alliance.  They would have been too big to take down.”“They needed to communicate with the heroes,” I said.  My expression twisted as the hole was pulled closed as part of the stitching.  They hadn’t even taken the bullet out, as far as I could tell.  I was aware that Rachel Lindt was staring me down with abject antipathy, and it bothered me that I was showing pain in front of her.“They couldn’t communicate with the heroes.  The Fallen apparently have allies hidden in the Wardens’ sub-teams,” Sveta said, her voice a whisper.  “By the time thinkers rooted them out, others would have made moves.  Or at least, that’s what the Undersiders are saying.”“Yeah,” Foil said.  “This is bad, but the alternatives were worse.”“We didn’t expect it to be this messy,” Parian added, almost apologetic.  Foil nodded.“You did a good job letting us get Seir, Victoria,” Narwhal said.  “Thank you.”I nodded a bit, head bent in a nod, “That was Imp, mostly.”Weird words to say.“Maybe in part, but there were a lot of Fallen there that were focused on you, not us,” Narwhal said.  In a tone that suggested she wasn’t going to accept any dissent, she repeated the former, “Thank you.”I nodded my acknowledgement, because saying anything would’ve meant having to acknowledge it when it didn’t feel wholly appropriate.  It was Narwhal being a leader and getting everyone in the right frame of thinking.“Do we want to take the opportunity to walk away from this?” Capricorn asked.“You want to run?” Bay asked.“No,” Capricorn retorted, annoyed.  “Retreat.  We have outside resources, ones I won’t detail, not when we were just talking about potential Fallen assets in the Wardens, and you guys are Wardens.  No offense.”“None taken,” Narwhal said.“We can go, hold the wider perimeter, figure out what we’re doing.”A few people talked all at once.  I was one of them.The talking died down.It was Weld who spoke up, clearly enough to be heard.  “This might be our one shot.  Dealing with the Fallen means getting close enough to go after the key members.  We might not get another chance.”“They have a lot of power synergies,” I said.  I swallowed through the pain that radiated from my arm and shoulder, the swallow caught, and I was without words until I could swallow properly and speak.  I tried to sound normal as I explained, “The chaos plays a role, because it means they can’t coordinate one hundred percent.  There’s more room to break up synergies and teamwork than there would be if we pulled back and gave them an hour to talk and sort themselves out.”“I can tell you who the big names are, and who the key lieutenants are,” Rain said.  “I know a lot-”“Rainnnn!”The woman’s voice echoed through the trees, thin and haunting.“Cover your ears!” Rain said, taking his own advice.  “Don’t look!”Don’t look.I covered my ears, but I heard whispers even with all sound blocked out.Mama Mathers.  Awake.                                                                                        Pitch – 6.2                                                                                        Narwhal’s group were some of the more experienced heroes around, hand-picked from teams like Foresight, the Shepherds, and Advance Guard.  They were veterans with years of experience, many of them ex-Wards who had grown up with their powers.  The Undersiders had taken over Brockton Bay’s underworld and had allegedly compromised its overworld, with fingers deep in the pie of government, local business, and the local hero teams.Now villain and hero sat together, crouching and kneeling on wet grass and in mud, hands over their ears, expressions grim.We’d backed off a bit, and now we huddled, with Capricorn erecting more defenses.Rain had moved his hands from his ears, lowering them.  Fluke looked at him and then nervously started to lower his hands.  Rain motioned for him to put the hands back, and Fluke wasted no time in doing so.Rain had put his hands up only to show us and convey the urgency of it.  Now he could be our ears, and he had his phone out of his pocket, his fingers tapping on the onscreen keyboard.The whispers I heard were indistinct, but they came with a return of the white snow in my vision, moving in my peripheral vision and creating shapes that weren’t really shapes, like the way faces could seem to stand out from a pile of leaves or the light and shadow in a cloud.Rain’s head turned, and I followed his gaze to look at Rachel.  Her hands were pressed to her ears, and her mouth was open in an ‘o’.  I saw her stop, mouth closing, her chest expanding as she drew in another breath.  The water from the branches above poured down onto her, and she didn’t seem to care in the slightest.  Her shaggy mane of auburn hair was plastered across her face, and aside from rubbing her forearm across the edge of her eye to move the hair so she could peer between the wet locks, she seemed fine with it.Again, she did the thing with the ‘o’ shape, and I could tell she was putting a good amount of effort into the sound she was making.When the mutant dogs responded to her howl, I could feel the low sound run through me, and it was clear the others could too.  Rain winced in pain, covering his ears again.Rachel was shouting, but I couldn’t hear her with my hands where they were.  The mutant dogs in the woods moved, running off to our right and left.  Around the camp.My arm throbbed, and I wasn’t sure I could keep covering my ears, even when the effort was mild and I was hunched over, bringing my head down to my hand more than the inverse.I chanced a momentary listen, and I could only hear howling.  Mama Mathers was being drowned out.Rain typed out his message, and held out the phone for Sveta, Capricorn and I.  Vista and Foil drew close enough, and so they got a look too.If you see mama you will start to see things.



If you hear… start to hear things.



Etc for touch/thinker senses



She can see/hear/thinker through these thingsI nodded.  I’d known and inferred most of that.Loose color scheme: white is leader/important Mathers“Valefor and Mama Mathers,” I said.Rain nodded, then typed.Bamet mutates with a touch. Permanent physical mental change. Uses stolen features to alter animals and make them smarter.  Would be near stables.“He wears white?” I asked.Rain nodded.He typed, and I felt a pang of irritation at the fact that Rain hadn’t shared this earlier.  I could understand that he hadn’t been able, but some of this would have been really good to know.Coronzon pulls himself into portal and builds up strength. Ive never seen but he comes out messy and big.  Has cancer/is not active much except in sitting in as elder in council“This is the leadership again?” I asked.  “White?”Rain nodded again.He was typing more when a dog came barreling out of the woods, straight for us.  Its mouth was open wide, tongue lolling out the corner, and it howled with the howl momentarily interrupted each time its feet slammed into the earth.Vista’s power increased the space between the dog and us.  The dog might as well have been running on a treadmill, but the treadmill was real ground.I started to move forward, ready to intercept, and I glanced at Rachel to double check.  Some of it might have been that she knew her dogs best, and I could use her reaction to know what to do.  Another part of it was that I knew she had a violent history.I’d already made the mistake of letting that go too easily with Ashley.Rachel, hands over her ears, was approaching.  She shouted something to Vista, but Vista couldn’t hear.I leaned forward, and I used my good arm to pull Vista down.  The level of noise the dog was making was unreal, and I could hear shouting and commotion, including Rachel’s cussing.  I remained ready to shield the others as the dog lunged forward, faster in running than Vista’s distortion was extending.The dog broke free of the distortion and closed the distance.  I saw the slobber flying, the rain splashing off of its back, and I saw the eyes, recessed in eye sockets framed in spiky bone.I threw myself to the ground.The dog leaped over us, and over Capricorn’s wall.The Fallen were in the woods, closing the distance to us while we couldn’t look or see without risking running into Mama Mathers.I covered my ears again, and I risked looking.With my hands over my ears, I could hear my heartbeat, and I could hear the lowest sounds the dogs were making, the impacts when they ran too fast and hit a tree with the broad side of their bodies, and the crashing thumps when they hit one of their targets.The patter of the rain was gentle and the moisture was cool against my lower face, the light from the overcast sky was mild and softened by the branches overhead.   But for the conflict, the monster dogs and the mass of people in costume, it could have been a really nice day for a walk in the rain.It was an odd thought, I knew, but I was struck by the contrast.I wondered if Chris experienced a bit of this, his headphones muffling the outside world, as he took stock of it.Strange, too, to have the monster dogs present, but not to be having to deal with them as a horrific kind of opposition.  I didn’t have to try to get between them and civilians.  I didn’t have to worry about failing to save a civilian from the dog that had maimed them.If and when I heard the howling in the distance, I wouldn’t be reminded that the outskirts of my hometown were being stalked by these kinds of monsters, sometimes with innocents getting hurt.I really didn’t like Rachel, but…Paradigm shift, I supposed.Fuck, my arm hurt.  Pulling me back to reality.  Civilians were still a concern.  The first wave looked like Fallen soldiers.  Others might come.I took flight, going from a position low to the ground to the upper reaches of the trees.  I took my hands away from my ears, and the only sound I could hear was the incessant howling of the dogs and the faint static sound of rain against leaves.Dangerous to use my thinker-one power when Mama could be in the area, but my instinct was that she wasn’t. Now that I was thinking about her, the whispering was back.  The snow was the same as before.The power wasn’t really a power, but the benefit of flying.  A bird’s eye view, being able to see the battlefield from a semi-decent vantage point, provided I could get up high enough.  I could see motion through the trees, but I couldn’t see much else.No white.  Seir had dressed in black – if Rain had continued to talk, would that have been part of it?  How set was it?  I could imagine the Fallen identifying themselves as closer to the Simurgh sticking to white or silver, while the Leviathan-favoring Crowleys might prefer green.No green, no black, no white.  I wasn’t even sure if it was that hard-set, or if my speculations were off-point, but it helped on a level.  It helped validate my assumption that Mama Mathers wouldn’t be part of a headlong rush, and I liked even the idea that my enemies’ costumes might be conveniently color-coded.Valefor and Mama Mathers were scary, or Valefor had been scary, but they weren’t warriors, and they weren’t generals.  Their weakness in this was that they were subtle players and the small-scale war wasn’t subtle.I descended, aiming for the group where the Fallen were more numerous and the one dog was alone.One cape, that I could tell.  She wore a biker helmet, with fragments of helmets worked into her costume.  Her arms looked like melted plastic, swords with the blades curved into hooks on the end.  Weld was fond of the design- what the hell had he called them?  She was using them to climb the dog, hacking at its face, and missing as it shook and twisted its head away.There was a limit to what I could do when my arm was hurt to the point my entire body was feeling it.  I grabbed her by the helmet with the one hand, and pulled her back into a more upright position, until her stomach was exposed.  I drove my knee into her stomach, and felt some resistance.  Light armor.I kept my knee where it was, and flew straight up, twisted around so my bad arm was furthest from her.  She pulled back, trying to get into a position to hit me or fight back, and I used my grip on her helmet to jerk her head down, until her ass was higher than her head.My old mantra, from before.  This was the disorientation.The issue with her weapons was that they had reach, where the more dangerous part of the weapon was the hook, and I was in too close for her to properly use it.  Toward the base of the weapon, the melted plastic was sharp in places and jagged, but it wasn’t going to gut me.Hook swords.  That was what Weld had called them, back when we’d been on a team together.She brought the crude base of the hook-sword against my armor, and it caught on the breastplate.  She used the catch to reposition, twisting around.I could see that her helmet had changed.  It had waves and ripples that looked almost like hair, and it had a melted-plastic emblem as part of the visor, appearing where the eyebrows might meet.  It was no larger than my palm, and looked like a star with the bottom two legs removed, spikes radiating up.It was my emblem.The armor I’d felt at her middle was my breastplate starting to form.  It was completely formed now.Faceless, featureless, biker girl wrestled to get to a more upright position, and she leaned back far enough to catch the hook of her right hand on my breastplate.  She reared back, other arm back, and I did a barrel-roll.The hook came at me as she fell away, a last-ditch effort to catch herself.  I brought out my forcefield just long enough to deflect it, and the hook caught on that instead.  When I put the Wretch back where it belonged a moment later, she fell.Biker-girl was eerie, because of the black melted-plastic look, the faceless visor, and the fact I hadn’t heard her make a sound.I flew after her, faster than she fell, and I was ready to catch her if she needed it.  I watched as she used the hook-arms to swipe at the tree branches, trying to find traction.  She caught one branch with two hooks, and one slipped free of the thinner edge of the branch.  She swung in a quarter-circle before the other hook came free as well.She made her descent, hooks finding more purchase, until she found a branch thick and sturdy enough to catch her body weight.She swung forward, backward, and then lifted the hooks free, performing one flip in the air before landing square on two feet, hooks out to the side.I hit her a second later, literal flying kick to ribs.  She bounced off of a tree before collapsing to the ground.  I winced at the pain in my arm, as the impact from the vibration traveled through my body to the injury.I flew to her side and checked her vitals.  The plastic was melting into black ooze, breastplate included.  I heard and felt her cough and saw her whole-body flinch in reaction.“Ribs?” I asked, as I put my hand to her bodysuit-covered collarbone and felt the already wheezy vibration of her breath.  She nodded, tight.  I asked, “Do you have any fight left in you?”She shook her head.“You’re biker, right?”A nod.“Stay,” I said.  She slumped back.  I checked my directions and used Capricorn’s wall as a reference point, as the wrestling in the air had turned me around.  I looked down at biker girl, “Nice descent, by the way.”“Thank you,” she said, her voice soft but strangled, before she coughed hard, with more full-body flinches.“You guys have got to stop fucking working with the Fallen,” I said.“I-” she started.Then I heard her try to scream, and I saw her try to move, as if to get away from something, only for both things to fail.Mama Mathers.Rain’s refresher- she watched, she heard, and she could pull something like this, to take any of her people out of commission or make them suffer for a perceived failure.Or to mess with us.  Like with the breaker.  Also a biker, now that I thought about it.  They were expendable in her eyes.Nothing I could do except deal with Mama Mathers sooner, or pave the way for others to do the same.I flew to the others, looking for Weld amid the dogs and Fallen, and finding him taking on four unpowered Fallen and one biker.  The dogs kept their distance while Weld fought, barking and howling with a volume like cannons firing.“Go down!” I called out.  “Getting beat by Weld is better than somehow winning and the dogs coming after you!”“Eat cocks, heathen!” a Fallen soldier shouted.I approached at a walk, keeping the guy between Weld and I.  I saw his agitation grow, as he tried to keep Weld in focus while not ignoring me.  He couldn’t run out to one side either, with the dogs around.A face in the corner of my eye made my head turn.  Visual snow.  The guy ran from Weld and came after me while I was distracted, machete held high.I hit him with my aura, and I saw his expression change.  His attack was delayed, thrown off by the surge of emotion, and I flew up a bit to put a foot on his chest, my hand down and ready to smack the blade with the Wretch out if it looked like he’d cut me.I used my foot and my flight to push him in Weld’s direction.  The Fallen soldier landed on his ass at Weld’s feet, and Weld stepped on one of his calves.  I could hear the bone crack.A young ‘punk’ Fallen in the group surrendered, dropping to his knees, hands up.  One Fallen hefted a baseball bat while approaching his surrendering kin, but then backed off as Weld quickly advanced on him.It hardly mattered.  Maybe the bat would have been more merciful.  The surrendering Fallen slumped over and fell to the ground, eyes wide, twitching.  No screams, only a near-immediate catatonia.Those who remained looked and saw, and then they turned toward the most vulnerable target they could see- me.I hit the ground to spray them with dirt and mud, flying back a little, and one of the dogs lunged in, trampling them.Weld and I remained where we were, checking that nobody was going to get up anytime soon.  We relaxed when they didn’t.Well, insofar as I could relax, seeing the person Mama Mathers had taken out.“You get Mathered?” I asked.Weld glanced at me, then tapped his ear.  He turned his head to show me.No ear canal.  He’d welded his ears shut.  It was one way to do things.I gestured, and he nodded.  We headed back to where the others were at the more fortified wall, a short distance into the woods proper.  Another wall was at the wood’s edge- this group had to have climbed it, and beyond it were the two farmhouses that were near.  The denser settlement was a few minutes of jogging beyond the closest farmhouse.We’d have to leave the fallen Fallen where they were.As I rejoined the others, I could see more signs of fighting.  Fallen had flanked this group.Prancer’s group was struggling, but these capes knew what they were doing.  Sveta, Narwhal, Vista, Capricorn- Rain was just about the only cape present who didn’t have a lot of experience in crisis situations.Parian was at the far end of the clearing with Foil.  As she rejoined us, she tossed something at me, levitating it with her telekinesis.  I caught it.Cloth set around beads or something hard, with thread binding it shut.  I saw her tap her ear, and I nodded.The makeshift earplugs fit snugly, and the cords trailed out a bit.Rachel looked annoyed.  She said something, and nobody could hear her.  Imp laid a hand on her arm, indicating her ear, and she gave Imp a more annoyed look.I turned to Rain, and waited as he typed his message into his phone.Missing dog.I raised a hand, then did my best to indicate with gestures that I’d look.If someone or a group of someones was capable of tying up a dog, then there was a chance it was one of the more problematic factors in play.I used the bird’s eye view, moving carefully at first, then checking with more confidence as I verified that Mama Mathers wasn’t close.There was movement.  Something big.  I flew down to where Rachel could see and indicated a direction.I flew to the dog.The dog prowled, the low growls it was making deep enough that I could feel the vibrations in the air, even though I couldn’t really hear.  It was a gangly thing, as Rachel’s dogs went, and the plates were lighter.  I wondered if it had started as a chihuahua.  I was pretty sure breed factored in.I realized it was focused on something, and flew closer.  It snapped at me as I got closer, and I flew back and up.A small movement made the dog jump back.  It saw me and jumped back again.I realized what the movement was- a figure, camouflaged.  The camouflage was dying out, and it wasn’t nearly as effective as it had been.“It’s you,” I said.  I pulled out an earplug.“-get this thing to stop growling at me?  You’re supposed to be strong,” Chris said.“What are you doing this close to the fighting?”“Get this thing off me!  What are you, deaf?”I flew down between him and the dog, and in facing the dog, I could see Rachel approaching at a jog.“Can you call him off?” I asked, gesturing.She whistled, and the dog backed off, going to her side.“Thank you,” Chris said.“What are you doing here?”“Keeping an eye on things, trying to be ready with my next form if we need it,” he said.  His features were almost visible as he moved and the camouflage shifted.I looked over in Rachel’s direction.  “Dog spotted him sneaking up on us.  He’s friendly.”“Hi friendly, I’m Imp,” Imp said.“Ha ha,” Chris said, humorless.  He turned his camouflage-cloaked face my way.  “Should I transform?”I considered for a moment, then shook my head.  In a softer voice, I said, “The form’s slow, you said.”“Yeah.  I could keep an eye on things, though.”“We have someone we’re trying very hard to avoid keeping an eye on, out there,” I said.  “You should get those headphones of yours on before we go to the others, because we don’t want to hear her either.”I heard him rustle.“Besides,” I said.  “We might want to move to a phase two kind of approach.”“I didn’t think you guys made that much progress,” Chris said.“Speak for yourself,” Imp said.  “Please.  I have no idea who you are or what you do, so speak, fill us in.”“Don’t be annoying,” Rachel said.“You have a really bad gauge of what annoying is, for the record, especially when you bring Yips along all the time now-” Imp said, indicating the gangly dog.  “And Yips is your worst dog.”“I’m trying to make him a better dog, like I’m trying to make you a better human.  Don’t be annoying.”“Fine.  You handle this without my help.”“Fine,” Rachel said.  She reached out, then let her hand drop to her side.  She looked my way.  “You found my dog quickly.”I nodded.“Good work.”“Okay.  Thank you,” I said.  There wasn’t a follow-up and there wasn’t really anything for me to say or ask her, so I turned to Chris.  “We didn’t make much headway, but they have a crapton of capes and the Hollow Point guys seem to have crumbled.  I’m thinking phase two, but I haven’t brought it up with anyone else.”“Phase two?” Rachel asked.“Contain,” was Chris’ blunt response.“Okay,” Rachel said.I wanted to explain further, but my eye and ear were somewhat compromised.  Would Mama hear and adapt?That’d have to do for an explanation.  I’d outlined a multi-stage course of action with a list of priorities, and we were already having to skip to the next big phase, without having removed the capes Rain had mentioned.  Valefor was out of action, but Mama was in play, Bamet the animal herder was out there, Coronzon the monstrous changer was there, and then there were the Crowley brothers.As far as I knew, they were the only Fallen left.  The Mcveay’s were kaput, the Behemoth-worshipers with the strong religious bent hadn’t survived the apocalypse.The Crowley brothers weren’t really water manipulators, by and large.  They and their immediate family members tended to riff on the duplication theme, often duplicating things that weren’t themselves.I’d really wanted to knock out at least most of the leadership before moving on to the next phase.  Taking out all of the major leaders would have worked too.“I recognize you,” Rachel said, interrupting my thoughts.“What?” Imp asked.She was talking to Chris.“You know him?” I asked.“What?” Chris asked.  “No she doesn’t.”“I know of him,” Rachel said.“No she doesn’t,” Chris said.“What?” Imp asked, again.  “Wait, the changer thing- this kid is the fucked up bird thing we saw and the crawly skull thing we heard about?  And the tentacle thing from the video Tats showed us?”“Video?” Chris asked.“Is he?” Rachel asked.  “Oh, okay.”“What?  How is that okay?” Imp was incredulous.  “You can’t just raise a topic like that and say oh okay.”“Whatever.  It’s not important,” Rachel said.“You have me on video?” Chris asked, sounding as alarmed as I’d ever heard him.“No big deal,” Rachel said.  “Not important.”“It’s important to me!  I don’t like people recording me without my permission.  I get enough of that with the one teammate.”“Fuck me,” I said, under my breath.  Louder, I said, “Guys.”“You know him?”Rachel shrugged.  She laid a hand on her dog’s neck, and the dog jumped.  She sounded like she was trying to be soothing as she told Imp, “Forget I said anything.  And you’re being annoying again.”“Guys.”“Rachel, you know I love you in the most hetero of ways, but telling people to calm down never works and it’s not working here.”“I told you to stop being annoying, not to calm down.”“It’s the same thing, with me.  I get stressed, this is how I deal.  And I get stressed when you say you know him-”“She doesn’t, by the way,” Chris said.  “Needs to be said again.”“-I have a right to be irritated when you don’t finish the thought.”“Thought’s finished.  I recognize him.  Thought started and ended.”“How?  Who?  When?  Where?  When?  Who?  Explain.”“Too much hassle now that you’re being annoying,” Rachel said.  “I’m fine leaving it be.”“I can and will do horrible things to you without you knowing,” Imp growled.“I’m fine leaving it be too,” Chris said.“Good for you two, but I’m not fine!” Imp retorted.I pushed out with my aura, getting their attention.“We have a job,” I said.“Good,” Rachel said.  Imp, meanwhile, only huffed.We backtracked to rejoin the others.  Chris stuck by me, adjusting his clothes so that the garment he wore in monster form cloaked him like a poncho, the folds covering his lower face.  He wore the headphones, but he didn’t have the braces on.“You’re okay?” I asked.  “Not seeing things?”“I’m seeing lots of things.  I need distractions.”“There are others who are comatose right now because she got to them.”“Emotion powers don’t affect you as much, right?” Chris asked.“Yeah.”“Monsters don’t get to me.”I thought about responding, but we were back where the others had gathered.Sveta was with Weld, Narwhal had most of her team, Foil was with Parian, and Vista was sticking close to her team with Capricorn sitting next to her.  She was saying something in Tristan’s ear, while he held the earplug just slightly out of his ear, ready to put it back in at a moment’s notice.I needed to say something to her.Rain was just far enough ahead of the others that I thought he wasn’t part of the greater group.  He was with the stragglers in Narwhal’s team, Fluke included, and they were coming back from a brief excursion, carrying some of the injured they’d collected.  The biker girl with the broken ribs was one.“Can you hear?” Rain asked.“Yes,” I said.“We grabbed these guys because we need to see if we can shake them free of the effect.  I wrote up more on my phone, to catch you up.”“Snag did a number on you.”He nodded.  “But I want to help.  Take my phone.  It’s a resource.”I nodded.  I took the phone, then gestured to the others.  “Come.  I want to discuss this.”When I approached Narwhal, Vista and Weld, it was with Sveta, Rain and Chris at my back.  Capricorn was already hanging out with Vista, so he had to take only a few steps to join us and be part of our group again.We were missing two members.  We’d soon have another backing us, if Narwhal was game.“I’m thinking phase two,” I said.“If we can’t crack this army of theirs and knock out their leadership, do you really think we can contain it?” Weld asked.“I think we have to change venues,” I said.  “We leave.  We make this a siege.”“That’s phase two?  No,” Rain said.  “They still have hostages, and they have the food to drag this out.  Hostages.”“We’re hurting the hostages by being here,” Narwhal said.  “The Fallen and their allies are being subjected to mental torture the moment they fail expectations.”“We can back off, and you can fill us in so we’re armed with knowledge,” I said.  “The closer we get to them the more we get caught up in their rhythm, so I want to pull back.”“You’re sure about this?” Sveta asked.“I think so,” I said.  “I don’t see a clear other way.  We’re pinned down, and that’s even with us having heavy hitters.  We can’t get close if seeing or hearing one person can destroy us.  The big issue is that they’re united in their horribleness, and we’re… all on different pages.”Rain hissed, “If I can contribute anything at all, let it be me telling you that you can’t let these guys have a chance to regroup.”“Multiple buildings are damaged, Prancer’s group set fire to a number of them.  They’re in disarray,” Narwhal said.“They revel in disarray,” Rain said.  “W- they were the fastest growing settlement to start from scratch.  They’re good at kicking ass when they have nothing going for them.”“I know you’re concerned about the hostages,” I said.“Victoria,” Capricorn said.I moved my hand.  The same gesture he’d given me, before.  Flat, angled so it wasn’t quite a ‘stop’ gesture, not facing the grass and mud beneath us either.“Fuck,” Capricorn said.  “Rain, I get what you’re saying, but you left.  You’re out of the loop.  We really discussed this and planned this, and we took it to the heroes.”“Not that it worked out great so far,” Chris said.“Don’t snark,” Sveta said, quiet.“We’ve been accommodating of your situation,” I said.“You’re playing that card?” Rain asked.“We’ve been accommodating,” I said, again, reinforcing it.  “We’re here, and a big part of the reason we’re here is because you wanted this.”“I wanted to save good people in a bad situation.”“Accommodate us,” I said.  “Please.”I saw him make a fist.“Please,” I said.It took him a moment, but he relented.“I’ll talk to Advance Guard,” Narwhal said.  By her resigned tone, I could tell she didn’t want to pull out.I nodded.“We’re with Prancer, you know,” Foil said, behind us.“I know,” I said, turning around.“If you go, we’re staying.  We’ll do what we can here.”“We’ll have to dodge March if she’s still around,” Parian said, quiet.“Yeah,” Foil said. “This isn’t a good day.”“Be safe,” I said.“That’s the plan,” Foil said.Narwhal called out the order.  Rachel called out another.  Her dogs were guarding the perimeter, and they drew closer.  Some capes took up the job of watching for trouble.I grabbed Rain by the wrist, as we walked away.With Mama Mathers infecting us, there was a limit to what I could do.  As it was, I dragged my finger along his wrist, and I spelled out words.  They weren’t very clear words, only ‘ERIN’ and ‘NO-‘.  I didn’t get to write the ‘W’, because he pulled his hand away.  He stared at me through the lens of his mask.I heard him sigh.I made sure the others were secure and Narwhal’s team was ready to go, and then I flew skyward, until I was high enough up to be safe.  I made a call.“Looksee,” I said.“Oh my gosh, you have to fill me in on everything.”“Soon,” I said.  “Can you do me a favor, though?”“Yes,” Kenzie said, with no hesitation.  No qualifiers, either.“Tell me how things have gone on your end, first.  Distract me.”Sure enough, I could trust Kenzie to talk nonstop at the slightest provocation, and I could use that in the moment.I asked because I needed a bit of cover to give me time to type a message that was easily in my top three messages I never thought I’d write, while not looking at the screen.Shh. Find Tattle. Coordinate with us & undersiders.I heard Kenzie’s voice pause as the text reached her.  She kept talking, but I heard the renewed excitement in her voice.  What kid didn’t love a secret mission?                                                                                        Pitch – 6.3                                                                                        No plan survived contact with the enemy, but I hoped it would at least be recognizable in the aftermath.Phase two.  Contain and besiege.We staggered our retreat, with Capricorn walling off the path behind us before the group moved again.  The Fallen sent some people our way, but I had the impression the people were scouts, figuring out where we were and then getting scared off by the razor-forcefields and antisonic booms.Rain stuck with Narwhal’s group, and even contributed some of the suppressive fire.  As I flew around the treetops to keep an eye on things from above, I saw the occasional tree topple, as Rain’s power and something else hit a tree around the same time.Trees falling was good.  It helped to cover our retreat in the same way Capricorn’s walls did.He kept giving me looks.  I couldn’t read his expression while his mask was on, but I could make assumptions.  He hadn’t liked leaving, or even pretending to leave, and I knew he wanted to help Erin.Mama Mathers was powerful.  It wasn’t that she had the clout some other top tier capes did, but her existence created a blind spot where we couldn’t keep tabs on the Fallen’s side.Another wall snapped into existence.  Fluke gave the call to move on, and the group ventured further into the woods, away from the area where the Fallen camp was nestled.  Narwhal’s offensive team followed behind the retreat, with Fluke staying back to report to her as she caught up with him.  Weld was hurrying forward to stay near the front of the group, taking on a semi-leadership role.With each phase in our retreat, Capricorn’s walls went up faster and bigger.  Vista was sticking by him, and from what little I could see as I used my advantage of mobility to check on everything, they were getting along great.Yeah.  I needed to have a chat with her.Sveta was sticking with Weld, even though they had different focuses in the moment.  Weld was directing people and making sure the coast was clear, while Sveta had Weld’s phone in hand, a brick of a thing with push buttons that she needed two hands to hold.  He would have dialed for her, or answered for her while Looksee called.  Our kid tinker was on the other end.My phone was in my pocket, the cord of my earphones running up beneath my armor and hair to my ear, where it was covered.  I was looped into the conversation.With the rain pattering down around us, cool but not cold, my setup meant I could keep my hands and face dry, without risking that my phone might get wet.“I had my moment of heroism, I even caught some bad guys,” Looksee said.  “It’s probably kind of lame compared to what you guys are doing, but it’s my first win!”“Your first win,” Sveta said.“Mine and mine alone, yes!  I was keeping an eye on everything around the camp and the moment things started, a bunch of people in the town got in cars and raced off in your direction.  I told my friends here and they told Narwhal and her group, but nobody was in a good spot.  So I programmed like lightning, and repurposed the projector box.”“Not too many details,” I jumped in, wincing at the offhand mention of the trap.  “We don’t know who’s listening in.”“Sorry.   But I put up projections of police officers and vans and some heroes.”“What I’m hearing in this is that you’ve taken the time to capture and keep images of police officers, vans, and some heroes,” Chris said.He was in on the call too, apparently.  I hadn’t known before he spoke up.“I didn’t keep anyone’s faces or anything, and I changed up the hero costumes,” she defended herself.  “I even asked most of them if I could take their picture.”“Says the girl who could probably make a camera that steals literal souls if she tried.  Totally innocent thing to ask, and they have no idea at all.”“Could not.  Souls are for God to handle, numbnuts.”“Be nice, both of you,” I said.  “Tell your story, Looksee.”Capricorn was jogging along, with Vista at his side.  He produced orange sparks, and she distorted the space around them.  He shook his head, and the sparks winked out.It was really, really weird to look at the pair and realize they were about the same age.  I’d heard about Vista from Gallant before I ever even met her, and I’d tried my best to take her as a fellow hero first and a kid second, at his suggestion.  But she was seventeen, now.  Crazy.“I finished picking out the code and put up my projections just before they came around the corner.  They rolled up and stopped because they had a bunch of guns pointed at them.  I called the guy Victoria mentioned-”“Gilpatrick,” I said.“Yes!  I feel bad for forgetting his name.  He’s nice.  I really like him.”“You like everyone,” Chris said.“He’s likable,” I said.  “One of my favorite people.”I heard an audible increase in excitement when Looksee responded, simply from the fact I’d validated her impression.  “I see why.  They sent a van super quick and took all the people into custody.  Fallen, hanging back in the town.”“They would have been the ones keeping an eye on things,” Sveta said.“Reinforcements,” Looksee said.  “They had guns.  The assholes.”It was Chris who answered that.  “We know about the guns.  The Fallen and Hollow Point guys have been shooting them all over the place.  Victoria got shot.”“What!?”“I’m fine.  Already patched up,” I said, as I thought,  I might need physiotherapy, and there’s a sensation in the center of this mess that makes it feel like the bullet is still in there, but I won’t die.“I got shot too,” Chris said.  “Not that anyone cares.”“When?” Sveta asked.“I was Dark Introspection.  It didn’t do much of anything, but I still got shot.”“Don’t talk like that, you guys,” I heard Looksee.  “I’m teary eyed even thinking of you guys being seriously hurt.”Okay, we needed a distraction.  “Looksee.  I’m thinking of a plan, beyond what we already talked about.  You’re a key part of it.”“What we just talked about, with our reinforcements?”“Yes,” I said.  Our reinforcements.  Good to phrase it that way.  Tattletale.“I’m looking into it,” Looksee said.“Good,” I said.  “This is separate.  If you’re up for it.”“Reinforcements?” Sveta asked.“Rain or I can fill you in after,” I said.She didn’t respond immediately.  Down on the ground, I saw her look up at me, her Brute-and-gauntlet-wearer class phone still held to her ear.“Okay,” Sveta said.“Looksee,” I said, hurrying to lay it out now that I’d cleared some of the obstacles and interpersonal issues.  “You may have people coming down the road.  It’s the easiest way for them to get out if they want to make a run for it.”“I’ll be ready.  With reinforcements, maybe.  Depends.  They’re not answering.”“Okay,” I said.  “How hard would it be to set something else up?  Gilpatrick is wrangling an awful lot of people.  What if those people were waiting elsewhere?”“Elsewhere?” Looksee asked.“Or… in as many places as you can manage.  I’m thinking we put the evacuees in one place, or spread them out.  They’re people the Fallen have some reason to care about.  We put images of the evacuees in other places, or we fill out the groups.  We give them a reason not to shoot the moment they come storming down that dirt road or out of the woods.”“I’d need to grab images and write some code.  I’d have to change the spectrum angle on the- thing.  There’s a lot of stuff.”“Can you?” I asked.“I can try, but it’s going to be hard, and I’ll be distracted.  I might have to hang up so I can focus.  Um.  Is there anything else I need to do or plan for?”“No,” I said.“I’m going to hang up then!  Will call back soo-” she announced, hanging up before she’d even finished the sentence.There was a pause.“Is the world ending again, or did she really just say that?” Chris asked.  “She decided of her own volition to hang up on friends.”“She’s excited to help,” Sveta said.She was, I suspected, but I wasn’t sure I’d heard excitement, exactly.Hard to pin down.Capricorn was building the next wall within Vista’s distortion.  He turned blue, and the wall turned to water.  There were shouts as people near the wall had to jump back to avoid getting sloshed.  Some couldn’t avoid it and were soaked or partially soaked.Narwhal raised her voice.  I double checked what I could see of the woods, to make sure nobody was coming or passing by our flanks, then dropped from my lookout position.I hung up my phone as I descended.“-of you showing off?” Narwhal asked.  I’d missed the start of the sentence.“No,” Capricorn said.  He was back to being Tristan, and he was drawing out the wall even as Narwhal grilled him.“This is a serious mission.  Your team posed it as such, and you were there- you saw how high the stakes are.”“Absolutely,” Capricorn said.“Yes ma’am,” Vista said.“What were you doing?” Narwhal asked.“Trying something,” Capricorn said.  “Vista saved me time earlier, I thought we could afford to lose some to try this, because it could save us a lot of time.”“Capricorn, I get the impression you’re a good cape, the walls are good, you’ve kept a level head.  But the people back there- they’re the ones who can’t afford for us to screw up or let the Fallen catch up with us.”Rain was standing a bit off to the side.  He’d been with Narwhal before, and he’d approached, because Capricorn was his friend.  He looked at me as Narwhal said the last bit.Soon, I pledged mentally, without saying it out loud.“Yes ma’am,” Capricorn said.“What were you trying to do, powerwise?” I asked.“Seeing what translates when I change out, if there’s a way to have her help make it bigger, not just move the sparks around faster, and keep it big even after she withdraws her space warping.”“You were trying other stuff before,” I said.“Yeah.  Flubbed this one, I think something went wrong.  The plan was to swap out, swap back a second later, so the wall mostly held… one second.”He turned blue.  Byron.“Didn’t go according to plan,” I concluded.“There was a resistance to swapping back,” Byron said.  “Had to push in a way I never have.”“Okay,” I said.Back to Tristan.“Scary,” Tristan noted.  I was already listening for the sound difference between the pair of them, so I wasn’t relying on sight alone, and I didn’t miss that he’d said the word in a voice that didn’t sound like either of them.  Or maybe it was the voice that fell in the venn-diagram overlap of how they were the same, in the middle of their case-seventy situation.Narwhal gave me a long look.  As if I was some kind of judge or voice for the weirdness of the team.“It’s a tricky power,” I tried answering the look.  “If they did figure out a way to save time and let them put up taller, thicker walls, I think you and I would be complimenting them on their ingenuity.  This didn’t cost us much.”Narwhal looked over in the direction of the biker and Fallen we’d collected.  Afflicted by Mama, they were dealing with the worst she could deal with.“We’re backing off anyway, and they aren’t pressing hard.  We’ll figure out another angle,” I added, sounding as confident as I could.  It felt strange to try to convince someone of Narwhal’s stature.  “Maybe figure out how to help them.”“We can try some things once we get far enough out, and that’s why I’m mindful of wasted time,” Narwhal said.  “I miss having thinkers, but we couldn’t conscience bringing them with us, with the risk.  They could crack this and help those people.  It’s frustrating.”“It is,” I said.  I glanced at Rain.And there’s Tattletale, ignoring Kenzie’s calls, doing something out there, I thought.  I don’t know if she could crack this, but she doesn’t seem too interested in trying.Narwhal turned to the Capricorn-Vista pair.“Right now we need steady and reliable, with no surprises.  Please,” Narwhal said, with emphasis on the please.  “And no more small talk.  Let’s stay focused on the mission.  I overheard when I caught up to you two.  We should save the… complex  inter-cape interactions for later.”Oh, so she’d noticed too.“Got it, ma’am,” Capricorn said.Vista didn’t voice her response, and from the way she held herself, I wondered if it was because she didn’t feel comfortable speaking in the moment.  She only nodded.“Vista,” Narwhal said.  “Can you cover our flank?”“Narwhal, ma’am,” Capricorn said.  “She does help me put them up faster and better.  I’d like her to keep helping.  You don’t need to separate us.  We’ll stick to what we know works, and we work well together.”“Vista,” Narwhal spoke in a lower voice, not taking her eyes off of Capricorn.  “From what I know of your power, you don’t need to be close to make it work.”“No ma’am, but I have to put it between the trees and it helps if I’m not too far away, so I can see instead of only feeling.”“I’ve been aligning the walls to work with her on that,” Capricorn said.“No small talk,” Narwhal said.  “You can stand further back and keep an eye on more of our flank while you work, Vista.”“Yes ma’am,” Vista said.Fluke grabbed Narwhal’s attention, and she reached up and over for a forcefield that appeared over her hand, gliding over to him.“That sucked,” Capricorn said.  He was working on the wall again.  “I generally pride myself on being a kickass, professional cape, and I just got told off by someone global in stature.”“I’m on the exact same page as you, Cap,” Vista said.  “Except I was a Ward, not a shill, and that’s my actual boss.”Capricorn didn’t give a visible reaction to being called a shill.  Something they’d talked about earlier?  A joke?“I think she’s nervous,” I said.  “This whole thing is worse than we thought it would be, and we thought it would be awful.”“She’s very nervous,” Vista said.  “We’re all nervous.  So much going on at the borders between worlds and we find out there’s something this rotten this close to home?  Things are supposed to be getting better and these guys seem really fucking committed to taking things in the other direction.”“She’s looking,” Capricorn said, as he turned his head toward his wall.  “And we’re still talking.”“Vista, can we talk?” I asked.She followed me off to the side.“I’m going to be cringing about this for the next five years,” Vista said.  “I goofed and got distracted, and everything went splat in front of my team leader, my team, my old team leader, you, Capricorn… and I think my boss knew why.”I had been able to tell what was going on when I was a hundred feet in the air.“First off,” I started.“Yes?”“The bad moments?  Never as bad as they are in your own head.  You couldn’t predict that.  Take it from the bystander and friend, don’t cringe for five years.”She didn’t respond immediately, but then she nodded, sighing as she did it, like she was letting something free.“Okay?”“Okay.  What’s second off?”“Second… do you want it blunt or do you want it gentle?”“Blunt,” Vista said.  “I’m a fighter.  I can take it.”“You have a problem,” I told her, quiet.  “You have a thing for unattainable guys in heavy armor.”I saw her react, like she’d been punched in the gut, before she steeled herself.  I could even work out the thought process, as she noted that others were in a position to see us and her.  She couldn’t react too visibly.“Dead son of a cunt, I might actually,” she said, under her breath.  “Unattainable why?”“Can’t say.  He’ll tell you soon, I think.  He thinks you’re cool.”“They always do,” she said.  “When things are calmer, you need to help me with this.”“I can try, but before we talk about that-”“We should talk about it another day.”“Okay.  But on this, just to clear things up in a way I can explain, he has a twin brother.  The one in blue-”“Oh.  That’s what that was.”“It’s not a secret, but it’s not something we tell the bad guys either.”“Got it.”“I won’t say go for it, because… messy.”“We’re all messy.”“Messy… in a way beyond the cape usual.  I don’t think they can date, as it is.  And a very different personality.  Brace yourself for that.”“Okay.”“I think he could use a friend, but again, being blunt-”I stopped as my phone rang, the earphone still in my ear, cord hidden by hair and armor.  I held up a finger for Vista.“Yes?” I asked.“It’s Looksee.  So I’ve got a thing.”“Talk,” Sveta said, on the other line.“I’m getting footage of the Fallen evacuees, two cameras out there, one up close to get the people and one pulled back to track light sources and get another angle.  My pulled-back is freaking out.”“Freaking how?” Sveta asked.“Literal ghost in the machine freaking?” I asked.“Yes!  Yes, exactly.  I’ve never heard that term before but it fits exactly.”“How has a tinker never heard-” Chris started.“Don’t look at it, don’t dig into the code,” I talked over him.“Wasn’t.”“It’s Mama Mathers,” I said, loud enough for others to hear.  “With Gilpatrick’s patrol squad.”“She was approaching, not with them yet, I think,” Looksee said.“Looksee, call Gilpatrick!” I warned.  “I’m on my way.”“I’m coming,” Sveta said.I thought of the secret message to Kenzie.  The plan.  I’d pledged something to Rain, too.  “Has Mama affected you at all?”“Barely.  Ears.”“Rain, how hurt are you?”I moved the hand of my uninjured arm at my side, where only he was really in a position to see.  A slash, side to side.“Really hurt.  Snag did a number on me,” he said.With luck, he was lying, and he got my intent.  We needed him as the one person who Mama couldn’t control, operating in a place she couldn’t see- away from those she’d infected.“Situate yourself, cover us to our south,” I said.  Again, I made the slash.  “Be ready to join whoever, but stay put.  Sveta, escort him, then come to us?”“Okay,” Sveta said, looking at Rain.  “Can do.”“Rain?  Fill her in on anything you can on the way.”“Understood,” Rain said, with a slight emphasis.  Rain jogged northward.“C and I will follow, or we’ll hold down the fort.  I’ll call when we can confirm,” Capricorn said.“I’m pretty mama’ed up,” Chris said.  “I’m dealing but it’s distracting.”“Distracting?” Capricorn asked.  He sounded slightly incredulous.“Seeing the surface of everything peeling away to show the shrieking flesh beneath distracts me.  Sue me.”Capricorn turned his head.  “Narwhal’s fighting.  I think the Fallen coordinated things so they’d hit all sides at once.”“She can do that,” I said.  “Seeing what she sees.”“You realize you’re going alone?  Until Sveta catches up with you.”“I realize,” I said, raising myself up off the ground a bit.I flew, zig-zagging to avoid the worst of the branches, ducking my head and letting smaller ones graze my hood.I had a view of the broader landscape, and I could see where the roads formed an almost hammer-and-sickle image, the half-circle of road with forest cupped in it, and the line stabbing through the southeast or east, leading to the Fallen camp.  Gilpatrick’s group was to the northeast.The wind blew at my hair and pulled my hood back as I flew.  Something I’d need to fix.  My arm throbbed with renewed pain, not because I’d moved it, but because I’d changed the angle of my body and that changed how the blood flowed through me.“Are you with us, Looksee?” I asked.“I am.  I called Gilpatrick, told him.  You sound windy.”I sounded windy because I was flying.  Looksee, though- she sounded quiet, and not nearly as talkative as before.“Are you okay?  No effect through your tinkering?”“No effect,” she said.I was especially aware of the fact that she hadn’t verified she was okay, and she didn’t sound okay.“What’s wrong?” I asked.  “Cut the others out of the call if you need to.”“Already did.  Victoria- Damsel is with Gilpatrick.  She’s sitting in the back of a van.”“Yeah,” I said.“What did I miss?  Don’t leave me out.”“I’m not,” I said.  “I haven’t talked with the others about it, they saw, but I don’t think Rain knows yet.  We’re digesting.”“Digesting what?”“She snapped, Looksee.   Not quite like we’ve seen before.  I think- she went there because she needed a time out.  I don’t know what’s going to happen.”“Okay,” she said.I could see Gilpatrick’s trucks.  I could imagine where we’d last seen Mama, and where she might have gone.  I averted my eyes from the part of the forest where Mama might be.“Did someone die?” Looksee asked.“Someone died,” I said.“She looks like someone died,” she said.“I’m at Gilpatrick,” I said.  “I’ve got to focus.  Step back.  Get away, phone her, or-”“I want to help.”“Then work on projections, or try again with our ‘reinforcements’.  Throw yourself into this if the distraction helps.  Just don’t look at Mama on camera, don’t dig into code she’s affected, and listen to the little voice inside you if it has doubts about doing something.”“I’ve got your back,” she said.Below me, a few people fired into the trees.  There was no returning salvo.I dropped out of the sky, landing more softly than I usually did, on account of my arm.No Mama.  The Fallen were remaining in the trees.“Victoria,” Gilpatrick said.  “Thank you for the warning.”“No trouble?”“We had a sudden influx of evacuees.  No guns, no problems.  We cut it off, told them to stay back.”“And?”“And if Looksee is right, I think your problem cape thought she’d conceal herself among hostages and catch us by surprise.”“If you hear or see her, she can affect you,” I said.“Great,” Gilpatrick said.  “Master-stranger!  Noise protection, eyes down!  Yellow for open fire, you better remember the rest!”People scrambled to listen.“Hey!” came a male voice from the woods.“How fast does it take effect?” Gilpatrick asked.“Fast, but limited exposure isn’t too bad.  Hallucinations, auditory and visual.”“I risk exposure, to know what’s going on?”I nodded once.  “I don’t see a better way.  Unless you want me to deal with it alone.”“No.”Gilpatrick looked like an entirely different man, with the tension in his face and neck.  He’d ceased being the tough-but-fair teacher and had become the soldier who had fought real-as-shit monsters.He held his gun in one hand and a small remote in the other.  The active squad members who weren’t managing the Fallen that had already evacuated were standing with ear protection on, caps pulled down with brim blocking some of their fields of view, their heads bent so they stared at the ground a few feet in front of them, instead of looking forward.Some of them looked pretty fucking scared.In the background, I saw Ashley emerge from the back of one of the trucks parked on the road.  Not repainted schoolbuses, but a heavy metal van that might have transported money once.  She walked around to the side and leaned against it, one hand over the wound on her arm.I nodded once.  She nodded back.Well, some sort of backup, in the event of a dire situation.And the guy in the woods was still making noise.  “Hey!”“What!?” Gilpatrick called out.“Don’t shoot!” the guy said.  “I’m unarmed, she wants to talk.  I’m talking for her.”Gilpatrick looked at me.  I wasn’t sure what response to give.  I knew this might be safe in the technical sense, with emphasis on might.  This guy could have powers and he could have powers from the same branch of the family, but odds were that he was unpowered and unarmed as he said.“She might want to talk, but she’s going to use the chance to threaten to do something horrible to hostages,” I said.  “And she’ll do those horrible things.”“Better to open dialogue,” Gilpatrick said.I nodded.“You and you alone, come out!” Gilpatrick called out.The Fallen was a skinny shirtless guy with a beard, tattoos up his neck and tattoos on the whites of his eyeballs.  He stood at the edge of the woods.  We stood on the road, a ditch with tall grass just in front of us, a hundred feet of uneven ground with rocks and weeds spanning the space between the ditch and the guy.  Gilpatrick’s group had made a makeshift bridge with two stretchers side by side, for the evacuees to cross the ditch.The bearded man paused.  “She says her son needs medical attention.”“We can negotiate,” I said.“She says you need to think about the long term.  You might not like her, but you want her in power.”“I somehow doubt that,” I said.“The Crowleys can’t and won’t accept peace.  The guns were theirs.  She only wants to be left alone with her congregation,” the man said.  “They are attacking Advance Guard right this moment.  If you stop her and you don’t stop them or wipe us out completely, they will gather up the remaining Fallen and go to war.”“The hallucinations stop now, and they stay stopped,” I said.  “We’ll take Valefor to a hospital.”“She says he’s your leverage then.  To keep the hallucinations gone.”“Yeah,” I said.  I glanced at Gilpatrick, and he nodded once.“She says she expected to see Rain here.”“Let’s stay focused on one topic at a time,” I said.  “You want Valefor to get help.”“Same topic, she says.  We were talking about leverage.”Erin stepped out of the woods.  She moved slowly, and she stopped, standing just behind and to the right of the man with the beard.  Her expression was drawn.  She met my eyes, and I saw the recognition.I saw her look at Ashley.“Give us Rain, and we’ll give you her,” the man said.  “Tell Rain, and he’ll agree to it.”The trading of hostages, less valuable for the more valuable, maybe.Rain had powers, so he counted as valuable, and he was immune to her powers, so he was a threat.  Hopefully he was a threat who was operating in the background now.Yeah, I wasn’t about to tell Rain.The man continued, passing on Mama’s words, “Prancer’s group is done.  They’re a non-threat now.  They’ll leave with their tails between their legs if we let them, and we’re not ready to let them.  Agree to leave us be, and we’ll call back the Crowleys.”“And you keep your ‘congregation’,” I said.“Even if you killed the leaders of each family, the congregation would remain,” the bearded man said.  There was a feral look in his eyes.  “We’re here to stay, unless you’re willing to kill us to the last man, woman, and child.  Learn to deal with us.  Negotiate.  Do you want peace, or do you hate us so much you’d prefer a mindless war?”“It’s not my place to make deals of that scale,” I said.  “I’d have to pass it up to the people at the top.”“There’s nobody at the top except God,” the bearded man pronounced.  I wondered if he was a preacher, with that passion.  He was a little less enthused as he went on to say, “No government, no law, no kings or queens.  You can decide what happens to Rain and Erin here, you can decide the little things, and we’ll all keep your secret.  That will be the shape of our negotiations today.”“Hi, Erin,” I said.“Hi.”“You okay?”“Not very.”I nodded.“Time matters, ‘hero’,” the bearded man said.“Back off,” I said.  “We need to talk a minute.”“Your loss.  The Crowleys are winning.  Our offer stands.”I looked at Gilpatrick, and at the row of his soldiers that were ready to shoot.  Erin was among the targets, and there were presumably others in the trees behind.  Indiscriminate fire would be disastrous.I looked back at Ashley, who leaned against the van, almost crushing her forearm in her grip, the grip was so tight.“You’re right,” Gilpatrick said.  “This isn’t our call to make.”“They aren’t about to wait and let us call up Chevalier and wait for him to finish whatever he’s got scheduled today, and they aren’t going to let us try to track down someone in government who might have the clout to okay this.”“No,” Gilpatrick said.I wondered if this was even something we could possibly do.  To compromise with a group that was uncompromising and unwilling to change its mind at its core.“Tick tock,” the bearded man said.  Using tactics to make us feel rushed to make a decision.  My mom had employed that on me, once, as something illustrative.  I’d been too young to appreciate the lesson, at the time.  I’d mostly been pissed off.“There’s no clock,” I said.  “Advance Guard can hold their own.  They’re good.”Stupid on a macro scale, but I’d liked how they functioned in a scrap.  I could trust that.  I wouldn’t get pulled into their tempo.“They’re outnumbered.”“They’re good enough that doesn’t bother me,” I said.“Tick tock,” the man said, again.  It irritated, which might have been the point, but it irritated me because it was so stupid and unintuitive.“Valefor has to be dying, with that wound.  If anyone’s feeling the clock, it’s you guys,” I said.  “No mother wants their child to die.”“She says lots of mothers do, but they keep it to themselves,” the bearded man said.  “We have time on our side in more than one way.  He’s dying slowly, she says.  Slowly.”Slowly.  The Speedrunners.They were operating in the background and every time they intervened, they made this whole situation vastly more difficult.The old side of myself wanted to kick their asses.“Tick tock, last chance,” the man said.Last chance?  What was I missing?  My eyes scanned the surroundings.“And it’s done,” the bearded man said.  He turned to walk back into the woods.  Erin looked bewildered, but he motioned for her to stay.“Stay put!” Gilpatrick called out.The bearded man froze in his tracks, his back to us.“I’m okay with dying, motherfuckers” the bearded man said, but he stayed put.  “She’s telling me that one of our powered just got your Rain… and Rain wasn’t where you told him to be.  He was coming up on us from behind.  Secondhand caught him and now your girl in the armor is cornered.  Four against her.”I drew in a breath.“Erin here has outlived her usefulness.”Erin bolted and I flew.  Nothing to lose.  I flew to where Erin had been, and raised my forcefield.  I felt it drop as a bullet hit it, and dropped to the ground.It was because I was at a weird angle and because my peripheral vision was untouched that I saw it.  Two streaks from above, straight down.I heard the metal crash, and saw circuitry and metal housing scatter.The gunman behind Erin had lost his rifle and he held his hand in an awkward way as he used the other one to reach down for the rifle.  Gilpatrick shot him before he could claim his weapon.The metal- pieces from Looksee’s camera.One dropped from the sky to hit the gunman’s hand.  The other-Children and other unarmed individuals emerged from the trees.  A wall of bodies.  the woman behind them was supported by two Fallen.The woman was bloody, a scrape down one edge of her forehead and a messy patch of skin and blood toward the top end, hair already matted into it.  Blood streamed down her face.The blood meant I hadn’t immediately recognized it as Mama Mathers.  The moment meant I hadn’t even realized the hallucinations had stopped.Kenzie had dropped one of her flying cameras on her.And the Fallen – there had been a good number in the woods.  Possibly the bulk of Mama Mathers’ faction.They were charging forth, a wall of hostages goaded to stay in front of them, and they brimmed with all the fury and menace of the legions of hell.Gilpatrick used the remote to flash.  Two red flashes, bright enough that the people looking down at the ground would see the color change.  I knew the code from my training with the patrol block.Get the hell out.                                                                                        Pitch – 6.4                                                                                        With the rain we’d had, there was a degree of slipperiness to the dirt and grass.  Twenty five, maybe thirty people were coming at us- it was hard to count when the allegiance of some of the hostages was so unclear, and some had guns.  All had a loose arrangement of hostages in front of them.  Some of the hostages slipped as they ran, and they were trampled by those behind.Gilpatrick gave me a worried look over his shoulder.  He was using the remote- three green flashes.  I was left to back up, letting Erin go ahead of me.  I crouched by the front tire of one bus.  Erin climbed up onto the bar at the side, so her feet wouldn’t be sticking out below the bottom of the painted bus.The color coding of Fallen came to mind- two were in white, with Mama Mathers being one, held up by two people at the treeline.  Another wore white and hung even further back, peering through the woods while wearing a pale leather animal mask.There were two options there, if I went by what Rain had told me, and both were messy.  Animal Master, likely, and the Changer geyser.One in black- a Fallen that was holding Mama Mathers up.  From the way they were handling her, she was still alive.  They were trying to take her to safety.One pointed at me, lifting his gun as he turned to his buddy, who had slipped in mud and fallen a few paces behind.  I pulled my head back behind cover.People opened fire, but they were our people.  Gilpatrick stood on the wheel of a bus, and fired over the hood.  I peeked at the result with my defenses up- the Fallen who wasn’t in black that was supporting Mama Mathers had created a wall of white-blue material with faces embossed on it.  The material cracked as the bullets hit it, and the cracks closed up almost as fast as they appeared.I’d peeked too long, and one shot me.  It pinged off of the Wretch, and I ducked back behind the front of the bus, where the wheel at least partially protected me.I knew the Mathers were notorious for their involvement in kidnappings and their connections to other families.  It was what defined them as a sect of the Fallen.  Now I was seeing the long term results of that kind of operation.  Rain had already spelled some of it out.Mama Mathers was a nightmare to deal with, and she’d traded for multiple capes who could protect her.  Layers of defenses, and Looksee had slipped past those layers to take her out of action.Rain dripped off of the front of my hood as I hunched over.  My arm was limp at my side, and it hurt all the more because of my position.  Even crouching, somehow, made my arm hurt more, because the angle was different, or because the blood flow had changed.“Captain Gilpatrick!” I heard the voice.Ashley.“What is it?” Gilpatrick replied.  He had his back to a truck much like I did.  Many of his students were crouched in the ditch, the road, another ditch, and a bit of mud and grass between them and the Fallen.“I want your-”A series of gunshots from a handful of the oldest patrol block members interrupted her.“-your permission to fight!” she finished.He hunched over, back to the wheel rim, reloading.  He called back, “I’m not going to do that!”“It’s not easy for me to ask!  I’m trying to respect-”He looked at me, not her, and interrupted, “You don’t need my permission to fight!”I didn’t hear the start of her sentence, as someone else on our side fired a gun.  A Fallen returned fire and shot the bus.“-want it,” she said.“Too bad!” he called out.  “You choose, I’ll be a witness and I’ll testify how you handled it, good or bad!”I looked across the far ditch, furthest from the Fallen, and saw where a stone had been rolled away to make way for the dirt road.  It was large enough a tractor or team of horses would have been involved.They’d be close in a matter of seconds.  I put one hand out, pressing it against the stone, and brought out the Wretch.  I pulled back, and the Wretch held on.  Together, we heaved the stone free from the earth that surrounded it.“Don’t fuck me,” I whispered to the Wretch.  I could hear the fingers and teeth biting into the stone, arms wrapping around it and squeezing until it threatened to break.Two hundred and fifty, three hundred pounds of rock.  The dirt road was constructed so it formed a hump, with vehicles traveling along the raised portion, with rainwater flowing into the ditches on either side, to be reabsorbed or to run off into some larger water source.  It was the cover the patrol block people were using, and it was cover I could use, albeit in a different way.I left the scene, flying low and hauling the rock with me.  The Wretch continued to wrestle with it, mindless, carving into it.  I worried it would break in half.Once I was far enough away I couldn’t see the people, I flew over the road, and flew at them from the sides.Fights were about information first, positioning second, action third.  It was why I studied parahumans, and it was why I favored the faux thinker-one power I had in my bird’s eye view, when I could use it without being shot.Without information, people couldn’t know where they needed to be.  If they weren’t in the right place at the right time, they couldn’t act.  Positioning was second.I was fast, silent, and approaching from an unexpected angle.  I looked for where the people with guns were, and I released the stone.  It hit the ground with no sound but an impact that saw them react.  I pushed out with my aura for good measure.With momentum, it rolled a short distance.  It rolled into the group, and four people toppled, a stone that came up to almost hip height hitting their legs with crushing force.If I was a police officer, I would have been clear to shoot, faced with people that had rifles and handguns.  I considered myself clear to demolish anyone who was armed.  The Warrior Monk would have been fine with it.I saw one person who had a gun I could make out, a rifle painted a dark green with a coarse, grippy texture.  The Wretch and I relieved him of the burden of having to carry a rifle and having unbroken hands.I knew I was risking getting shot by the first person with the presence of mind to point a handgun at me in an casual way, instead of drawing the thing and sticking their arm out.  Risky too, to fight when I didn’t have the use of my left arm, and a good hit to my arm when I was defenseless could bring me to my knees with the pain.The aura helped make people stupid, and I could use positioning in another way, moving fluidly and unpredictably as I ducked and darted between people.I wasn’t about to back off when they were this close to Gilpatrick, potentially Jasper, and others I’d worked with.  Even the pissy anti-cape types deserved to come out of this okay.Handgun?  I brought the Wretch out and slapped at arm or weapon.  Knife?  I did the same.  Bat?  Easy to hit the weapon and send it back toward the wielder’s face.A few braver members of their group pressed in, trying to dogpile me, grabbing instead of punching or swinging.  Harder to deal with, until I brought the Wretch out a bit longer.  I could see them react as it unfolded, like an irregularly shaped bubble around me.I withdrew the Wretch before it could get a grip on anyone or anything.One pointed a gun at me, and I flew past the gun to drive my forehead into his face.  Instinct, not pre-planning, but I was thinking the Warrior Monk would forgive me on that.  My arm hurt, inexplicably, from me delivering a hit with my head, and my forehead hurt.  I wasn’t wearing my mask- it still dangled from my waist, the curve allowing it to rest against my thigh.I didn’t let it show.  I watched the others back off, the recent damage and the aura being ample reason.  One had four bloody marks swelling on his chest, and I realized I’d been too slow to dismiss the Wretch, or it had been too quick to unfold.  She had managed to stab her fingertips into flesh.Hate.  The feeling hit me so suddenly and so unexpectedly that I thought it might have been one of Rain’s cluster-mates.  Hate like when I had been in middle school, arguing with a classmate who had spewed out insane, vile rhetoric that would have made them a perfect fit for Empire Eighty-Eight or the Fallen, and he had refused to listen because I was a ‘pretty, privileged white girl’ and that had somehow meant my experiences and opinions weren’t valid, even though he was an okay looking, privileged white boy.  I’d hated him and I’d hated that I couldn’t talk or shout sense to him and make him stop or even pause in being such a shitty person.Hate like I had channeled at my sister, because she had broken something intrinsic in me.  Because she had torn open emotional doors I had really wanted to protect and be tender with, so soon after I had lost Dean.  She had violated that and staked her claim to what lay beyond those doors, and it was only by twisting devoted, passionate love into devoted, passionate hate that I had briefly been able to retain something of myself and my boundaries.  Only briefly.I hated the Wretch, in that same way.  I hated the blood spots I could see where fingers had dug in, the guy now on his knees, fingers at his chest with blood seeping between them.  I hated the scratches on Moose’s face.I hated the ones with broken hands, arms, and legs, the ones who were lying on the ground screaming.  I hated that when I’d had the ability to be gentle, I hadn’t been, and now that I wanted to be gentle, I couldn’t.To top it off, I hated the Fallen.“Stand the fuck down!” I shouted.  “Or I won’t hold back anymore!”Rain fell all around us.  In the ditches by the road, the water made small trickling sounds.  I could hear gunfire in the distance, and I could hear the patrol block.My aura burned dark and intense, and I knew that they wouldn’t be feeling the pause or the odd mid-fight peace of rain and the ongoing violence being more distant.One of them looked at the hostages, who’d made it to the dirt road and now crouched there.  I flew straight for them, pushing past the people in the way with enough force to knock them over.My thought, my instinct, was that if they had a gun, I wanted to already be there, ready to stop them.  They didn’t have a gun, so I went easy.  I kicked them across the lower legs, the Wretch momentarily active.“Stand down and don’t even fucking look at them,” I said, pointing at the people they’d used as human shields.  “And don’t fucking think of raising a weapon.  I will shatter you, and you can see how well they take care of you here, or you can go to the hospital, get fixed up, and they’ll send you back home.”I paused.  I stared at them, meeting each one’s eye in turn.  Roughly half their number were on the ground.“Do you really think the Fallen are going to look after you when the weather gets colder, food is short, and you can’t be a farmer or a soldier?”I saw movement.  A blur.  I moved away, ready to raise the Wretch, and as much as I could raise my defenses as fast as I could put my thoughts together, the attacker was fast and I hadn’t anticipated being blindsided.The hit was hard, and the only reasons it wasn’t harder were that it hit my armor, at least partially, and I was moving back and away.I winced, my hip aching.  Maybe it was telling, that I’d been driven to get back and away before I’d thought to make myself impervious.Mama Mathers had kept bodyguards close, but she either had reinforcements from the other family, or this mob had more powered Fallen in it.It was a Fallen woman.  She was younger than me, going by stature and frame.  A Leviathan theme to her mask, but with a fin on top and at the sides.She came at me again, and this time I had the Wretch up.  She hit it hard, winced, and turned pitch black, freezing in space.She got me from behind, a cord encircling my neck, pulling tight.  With my breastplate set up the way it was, there was a little flare of spikes, a few inches in front of my chin, pointing slightly outward.  The cord or wire caught on that, and I brought my good hand up, gripping the wire.I pulled to get free, and I met resistance- at the same moment the obsidian black figure in front of me resumed motion.  She hit the ground with one foot, and launched herself at me.I activated the Wretch and tore through cord, catching on something solid enough that the Wretch flickered out.Metal wire, it seemed.  A garotte, no association with my friend and teammate.  In the course of moving away from the attacker, I moved closer to the unfrozen woman, and put her off her rhythm.  She changed, freezing in place, and the attacker I hadn’t yet seen attacked me from behind, hit me sufficiently hard to make me crash into the frozen woman.  The hit was enough that I’d bruise, but the residual impact made my gunshot wound explode with pain.I twisted around, exerting force against the immobile obsidian statue, and she came to life, stumbling back, just as I saw the attacker behind me freeze.One attacker, with two bodies.  Whatever one wasn’t active was immobile and apparently invincible.  Whichever one was active had enhanced speed and the strength that came with hitting things very fast.The scholar in me wondered for a moment about just why so many Fallen were such massive pains in the ass, with such a solid crop of powers.Conflict drive?  Close associations with other powers?  Careful selection and sharing of powers through breeding, insofar as powers were inherited that way?Wretch out, I punched one woman- hit statue.  I pulled the same arm back, elbowing the one behind me- only for her to become statue just in time.  The one in front was already moving out of the way of any follow-up attack, the Wretch grazing her, making her stumble a little.  She still moved too fast for me to give chase.She attacked relentlessly, and with a speed sufficient that the Wretch only blocked one in three hits.  I could use some basic fighting sense or flying away to protect myself against another one in three, but it still left a gap.  One or two hits made me stumble.  Another cracked me hard enough across the side of my head that I momentarily couldn’t make sense of what I could see.I connected one hit, then followed up with a swing, Wretch active, hitting the ground hard enough to send a spray of stones, dirt clumps and mud at her.  She went statue and attacked me from behind with her other self, but when I retaliated, the original self had to shake off the residual mud.I heard Ashley use her power.She sailed over the heads of Fallen, landing with a bit of a skid.  Her hair was wet and slicked back, and her eyes were wide with the extent of their whites showing.  No pupils.I wasn’t sure what to say, so I stated the obvious.  “You came.”“R needs help.”He did.  That he’d run into trouble had been the window Mama Mathers had needed.  I would have helped him already, but I could hardly leave my patrol block.Sveta had been with him, too.The lizard-demon Fallen came after me.  I fended her off, flying a bit away to position myself closer to Ashley.“Is it alive?” I asked the Fallen.  “Your other self.”The lizard-demon Fallen charged after me again, in lieu of answer.  I lashed out, and she became statue.  It was like hitting something Clockblocker-affected, from my hometown’s old Wards team.  No result, nothing got through.“I’m giving you one chance to-”Ashley’s power misfired.  She stumbled.The lizard Fallen went after her.  Another cord.  Harder to get it around Ashley’s neck, when Ashley was bent double- Ashley brought her injured hand up, and the wire pulled against her forearm, cutting into flesh.  Blood welled out.Power welled out too.  The power flared, and the cord broke.  The Fallen stumbled back, and became statue as Ashley turned to look at it.“If you’re a pair and not one cape with a gimmick, you’ll both want to stand down, because my friend hits pretty darn hard.”“I do,” Ashley said.  Long, wet white hair had fallen across her face while she was bent over.  It stuck there.The lizard Fallen cackled, but didn’t respond.She went after Ashley, instead of me.  Two of her at once, but never acting at the same time.  One became a statue the moment Ashley looked like she might have her bearings and be able to respond.  I flew over, and the Fallen girl moved around behind Ashley, shoving her in my direction, maneuvering to never give either of us a clear shot or angle.She hit Ashley in the midsection, and Ashley reached out, putting a hand on the Fallen’s collarbone to steady herself.  She was hit from behind, one hit to the kidney.She used her power, and it tore through the statue, ripping it apart.  Ashley was thrust away by the blast, and she landed not very far from where the lizard Fallen had dropped to the mud and grass, sitting there in shock.Ashley hadn’t been lying when she’d suggested her power could hurt me.It had been the final test, in a way.  The group of Fallen soldiers were hanging back, the patrol block having emerged, guns held up.  One or two in the Fallen still had guns as well, or had picked them up, but they were badly outnumbered.Had the lizard Fallen won, I wondered if they would have pressed the attack, even faced with equal numbers and more guns.  I wondered if they would have had a choice.Choice.  I looked for the instigator and leader.  Mama Mathers had disappeared into the trees, along with the Fallen in black, the one who had conjured the blue-white wall of faces, and the beast-masked Fallen in white.Gilpatrick’s group began to disarm, arrest and manage the Fallen soldiers, some tending to the wounded, others hanging back and keeping their guns raised.“R is in trouble?”“I overheard,” Erin said.  “One of Bamet’s animals came to relay information.  R was attacked.”“Rain,” another of the human body shields said.“I was leaving the full name out, dad.”“Don’t betray your own, Erin,” the man said.“Our so-called own betrayed us!” Erin shouted.  “Fuck!  They never cared.  We were only tools to use.  Shields to get in the way so they could get up close.”“No,” I heard his response.  I cut him off before he said anything else.  There were other priorities. “Attacked where?  How?”“I- I don’t know.  I’m sorry,” she said.  And in that instant, she didn’t sound like the confident girl I’d talked to.  She was shaken.  “It- bad.  Bamet’s animals, they barely speak English.  But his situation is bad.”I frowned.“If you find them, don’t kill the animals?” Erin asked.“The animals?”“There’s something human in there.”I frowned.  I had to go.“You good?” I asked Gilpatrick.“Yes,” he said.  “An awful lot of wounded, but- we’ll manage.”I looked at Ashley.“I’ll stay,” she said.  “Call if you need me, but-”But she’d turned herself in?Did she cut herself off because she couldn’t bring herself to say it?“I’ll protect these people if they need it,” she said, instead.So many people didn’t look like the ones I’d known.  Erin and Ashley both lacked the confidence they should have had.  Gilpatrick looked more like the grizzled soldier than the teacher.  Even the Fallen- well, they’d been threats and now the most aggressive and armed of them were on the ground, defenseless, making noises of pain.I didn’t look like the me I wanted to be, probably.  So soon after donning my new, pretty costume.This other me took to the air, flying against the falling rain, so that the gentle patter became something sharp in the brief ascent.Rain, Mama Mathers, and the remaining leadership figures of the Crowley and Mathers branches.Roughly in that order, anyway, as far as priorities went.I could see Capricorn’s work, and he had raised walls in a way that left the Fallen with far less in the way of places to go.  Some reached as high as the treetops, most others were shorter, speedbumps and momentary obstacles, such that going around was probably easier than finding a way through or over.I reached for my phone and dialed.“-n’t find him,” Capricorn’s voice came through.  There was a whoosh of air on his side of the conversation, stopping as he finished talking.“I can’t do much,” Looksee said.  “Victoria’s on the line now.  She was fighting.  Are you okay, Victoria?”“Fallen to the Northeast were arrested.  One powered among them.  Erin’s okay.”“Rain will be so happy to hear that if we can actually find him,” Capricorn said.  Still with the whoosh.“Mama Mathers got away.  But she’s out of action,” I said.“She’s alive?” Looksee asked.“Last I saw,” I said.“Okay,” Looksee said.  She sounded funny.  “Damsel?”“She’s staying behind.  Protecting them, she said.  But she wants to stay in custody, I think.  I think it’s a good idea.”“Okay,” Looksee said, barely audible.“It makes sense,” Capricorn said.  I heard Vista’s voice, and still with the whoosh.“Are you flying?” I asked.“We caught a ride,” Capricorn said.  “Traveling Narwhal style.  We’ll be coming around your way soon.”Narwhal style?“Okay,” I said.  “Sveta, Chris?”“Gone, same as Rain,” Looksee said.  “And changing.  He thinks Keen Vigilance might be able to hear something.”“Traveling up the east perimeter,” Capricorn said.  “Vista says she would appreciate a lift down to solid ground.  She’s not super confident of her ability to land.”“Land?  You’re actually on a Narwhal forcefield?”“Doing loops.  They travel in straight lines, but Vista can bend straight.”Okay.  I wasn’t just catching my two friends, then.  I was doing it while they were surfing on a flying, crystalline cleaver.Fuck me.“I’ll use my power.  Tell me when you start to feel it,” I said, my attention all over the place, as I looked for any sign of Rain, Sveta, Mama, Capricorn, and Vista.“Feeling it,” Capricorn said.I spotted them, and flew to match my trajectory to theirs.  “Only one working arm.”Vista’s power warped space around us, slowing their speed.  It took me a second to adjust.  I let the thing catch up to me, and rested my foot against it, leaning back and moving with it.“Catch him, catch me after,” Vista said, her voice briefly doubled on both phone and in person, slightly out of sync.I caught Capricorn’s hand.  I couldn’t use the Wretch, and the strain of my arm carrying him reached across my shoulder to my injured other arm.“I’m okay if it’s rough,” Capricorn said.It was rough.  He landed hard, clipping a branch on the way down.  He didn’t react or seem to mind, letting go and pointing.Vista had jumped, and she was descending slower, the space between her and the ground extending.I flew to intercept.  I caught her hand in mine.  Again, my arm complained.Not as heavy as Capricorn.“Thank you,” she said.I lowered her to the ground.  Capricorn put his hand out, catching her by the upper arm and helping with the final couple of feet.“Mama knew where Rain was.  If we track her, we might be able to find him.”“I can’t help,” Looksee said, through the phone.  “Both of my active cameras broke.  I’ve got another covering myself and Tattletale, I could send that.”Vista seemed confused.  I motioned for her to come closer, fished in between my armor and my top for my other earphone, rubbed it against the edge of my hood, and offered it to her.“It would take time to get here,” Capricorn said.  “Don’t worry about it.”“Shouldn’t I very worry about it?” Looksee asked.  “I should send them now in case they’re needed.”“Cameras broke?” a voice came through the phone, hissing.“Yes,” Looksee said.  “Don’t get on my case about it, vigilant dumbnuts, I’m not in the mood.”“Wondering… how?”“I dropped one on Mama Mathers and I dropped another on someone with a gun.”“It worked,” I said.  “I don’t know how you aimed that without looking through the camera-”“I didn’t.  My cameras were already fritzing out, so I sent them a slice of program, with facial recognition.  I centered it over them, accounted for wind, and when things sounded worst I had my cameras stop hovering.”“You weaponized… cameras?”“I told you not to get on my case about it,” Looksee said.“Am not.”“I didn’t weaponize the cameras, just so you know.  I’ve said I’m not good at making my cameras function like weapons.”“I remember,” Chris’ snakelike voice came through the phone.“I weaponized the off switch, obviously.”“Obviously,” Capricorn said.  “Send your camera.  If Mama Mathers is out-”“Pretty sure she is,” I said.“We can use all the help we can get.”“It’s not like Tattletale is responding,” Looksee said.“Victoria, can you give us another set of eyes from above?” Capricorn asked.I nodded, taking back my earphone from Vista.“I really hope he’s okay,” I heard Capricorn, the tail end of the sentence almost inaudible as I was already flying.The weather seemed to be easing up.  I noticed the precipitation wasn’t as sharp as I flew up into it.  Not like it had been minutes ago.Capricorn’s walls to the southern end of the camp had served to funnel the Fallen in other directions.  The road seemed untouched, the settlement was almost half and half for buildings that had been abandoned and leveled, and the fighting seemed concentrated at the north end, Crowleys and Advance Guard, and where I’d been helping the patrol block to the northeast.The northeast was a starting point.  I imagined they would want to go to where there was help.  That meant they’d either head for the center, through open space where I would have to be able to see them, or they’d cut north.  The latter would let them move through the trees.I reported it to the others.I spotted the first of the animals.  A man with a hunched back and the head of a pig, his body heavy with muscle that didn’t match an ordinary person’s.  There was a horse, too, but its normal long face had been replaced with a human’s, folding around at the sides in a way that distorted the mouth and made the eyes bug out.  Mama Mathers was draped over the back of the horse.My pulse pounded as I approached.  I turned sideways to appear less threatening and held my good hand up for the animals, trying to get them to ease up.  My only experience with horses had been at Dean’s family’s place.The pigman made noises, and I winced.  It sounds like a stuck pig.  An animal in pain.I’d wondered how the barnyard cape had blended in with the Fallen aesthetic.  I wasn’t wondering anymore.“Is she alive?” I asked.“Uuuuuhrh,” the horse moaned, in a halfway sound between a moan and a whinny.I held my hands up, easing them as I drew nearer.  I hesitated, then put a hand at her neck.  I felt for a pulse, felt one, and then pried open one of her eyes.  I watched it dilate in the light.I didn’t consider the administration of first aid or medical know-how a strength of mine.  I’d taken a class in first aid, and I’d learned it, a long time ago, and I’d refreshed myself when I had joined the patrol, but…Suffice to say, that base had been covered, for most of my hero career.The animals reacted, heads turning.  I glanced back.  the others had arrived.  Capricorn, Vista, and Chris as a broad mountain of hair and layered plates with massive ears and huge eyes, a foot taller than Capricorn.“Mierda,” Capricorn said.“Erin said there’s something human in there,” I said, staring at the animals.Chris started to approach.  The animals shied back.He sighed.“We’ll help if we can,” I told the animals.  “But can you show us the way to the others?”“You don’t want to do that,” yet another strange voice came through the phone.“I’ve been trying to get in touch, Tattletale,” Looksee said.  “You’ve been ignoring my calls.”“The fact you’re saying we don’t want to do this is a pretty good motivator to do this.”“Don’t be a child, Victoria.  You’ve got the Mathers leader in your hands.  Good one.  Now leave.  Or go help Advance Guard, because they really need it.  Your friend Rain is done for.  He was always going to be done for.”“Even if I was willing to accept that-”“Which we aren’t,” Looksee interrupted.“Our friend was with him.  Sveta.”“Garotte,” Tattletale said.“Sveta,” I said, more firmly.Capricorn and Vista were lowering Mama Mathers to the ground.  The ‘animals’ seemed more relieved than anything to have that taken care of.  The existence of human mannerisms and expressions on animals was disconcerting.Capricorn began creating a cage for her, to encase her body.He apparently deemed it better to contain her and risk that she wouldn’t be okay than to rush to give her medical care and risk other lives.  We’d already tried the more merciful route.“Okay,” Tattletale said.  “I don’t think it matters at this stage.  You don’t need Bamet’s beasts.  I’ll tell you where you need to go, if you promise not to stir up shit with Cradle and his friend.”I glanced at Capricorn, then back at Chris.“Promise,” I said.“That’s a lie.  Whatever.  I’d remind you this is me being nice again, but you don’t care.  There’s a barn southwest of you.  You overshot when you approached.”I looked.  A barn, in the middle of pen fields, with some stone-and-mortar fences separating fields from road, so no car would drive off the road and into the field without meeting an obstacle first.The rain was only a trickle now.Vista warped the space, to bring everyone closer.  It only served to make my trip there even faster, as I flew.The first thing I noticed was the blood and the bodies.  Animals had been slaughtered, and their parts made for a macabre, eerie picture, with human and animal mixed and blended.  The two Fallen bodyguards were dead, and there were a few others, besides.The second thing I noticed was Cradle in the rafters.  His robot was large enough that its hands could touch multiple walls, grip the rafters and touch the ground at the same time.  Cradle was perched on the back of one hand, crouching as he stared down.  Another parahuman, dressed in black with a red handprint on his mask, was gripping one finger, dangling.  He had a cleaver in his hand.And in the corner, almost impossible to see, Sveta was huddled.  Her body was damaged, and tendrils snaked out, gripping herself, none long enough or positioned well enough to do more than snake around her shoulder and chest, twisting at cloth to reveal the painted shell beneath.  She was glaring, hate, and in the moment she looked at me, the hate broke, and she looked like she might cry in relief, or in grief.She held what remained of Rain in her arms, as he gasped out short breaths, like a fish out of water.  The damage done- it hadn’t been her.“Let’s not make this a thing,” Cradle said.It was going to be a thing.                                                                                        Pitch – 6.5                                                                                        The weather had relaxed some, but the barn we were in had a corrugated metal roof, and each drop that hit it snapped against the hard, hollow surface.  The sound was like dull static, punctuated by Rain’s gasps.Nobody around.  Most of the fighting had moved to the fringes and perimeters.  Whether it was upside or downside to our secret plan to get behind the fighting and hit them somewhere vital, I couldn’t be sure.Had to admit, after seeing Rain, I really would have liked to hit something.  It might have been nice to have some regular bad guys around.  Something told me Cradle wasn’t about to let himself get smacked around.He was smiling slightly.  Asshole.I kept an eye on Cradle and his assistant as I got closer to Sveta.  She adjusted as she could to put Rain closer to me and further from the crack in her shell where the tendrils were licking out.I knew the rule that the badly wounded weren’t supposed to be moved, less because of any medical knowledge I’d picked up, and more because I’d seen an awful lot of people with injuries over the year.Rain?  The rule should have applied.  It was the kind of badly hurt that made me worry that any further tampering would break him.He had a cut on his face that parted his mask and the bridge of his nose, extended through his upper lip, through the lower lip, and down to his chin.  His mouth was open as wide as it could go, bloodstained teeth showing, and the cut on his chin was open wider than his mouth.  There wasn’t darkness beyond that wound- it was the opposite, with the white of bone showing.Sveta cradled his head with one hand and arm, even after moving him some, and her hand pressed against the chin, blood getting into the gaps of the prosthetic, the fingers doing very little to hold the wound closed or staunch the bleeding.I knelt at her side, felt Rain jerk his head as I moved her fingers.  I pushed the wound closed, then moved her fingers with my hands, positioning them, holding them firm.  I took my fingers away, and it was sticky enough I felt her fingers move as mine did.  They didn’t move so much that the wound opened again.  Better.There was another cut at his eyes- eyelid, bridge of the nose again, and the orb of the other eye.  Shallower, but the damage to the eye made for a lot of fluid.  His good eye was closed, a mixture of blood diluted in damp settled into the creases and cracks.  He pried it open, jaw chattering a bit with the effort, and stared at me with one eye that was shot through with blood, but not bloodshot.More moisture.“Come on,” I said.  “Hang in there.”“We should go,” I heard the man with the red handprint on his mask say.“If you try to walk away from this, we’re going to have a problem,” I said.“Don’t be unreasonable,” Cradle said.“Thinker,” Sveta whispered.  “Combat focused.  Cradle hit me with something I couldn’t see.  It might have been a laser not visible to the naked eye.”I nodded, trying to divide my attention between the villains and Rain.What was I even supposed to do?  In any other situation, I would have picked up Rain and flown him to the nearest hospital.  The reason I wasn’t was that I was genuinely worried that a firm shake would make what little blood he had in him fall out.A mercy, maybe, that Capricorn, Vista, and Chris all turned up.  Less a mercy that they had to see.“What did you do?” Capricorn asked.“And they all turn up,” Cradle said.  “You swapped one member out.”“Oh no,” Vista said, as she moved close enough to see Rain.  She hurried to my side.“There’s no point,” Cradle said.I was undoing my belt, a faux-gold band that I’d used to add some color so my costume wasn’t too top-heavy.  The process was hard, complicated by the fact that my left arm had a hole in it and my hand wasn’t cooperating as a consequence.I needed to refresh myself on things- I’d learned about tourniquets from the patrol block, but in the moment it felt like half of what I’d learned was that tourniquets were a complicated, complicated thing.  Compartment syndrome, damage from long-term use.“You bastard,” Capricorn said.“I’m not the bastard here,” Cradle said.  “He is.  Everyone we’ve told the story to has agreed it’s fair.  When the bad guy is shitty enough, it stops being revenge and starts being justice.”“That’s not right at all,” Sveta said.Cradle sighed.“Does ‘everyone’ include Tattletale?” I asked.“I don’t see how that matters,” Cradle said.  “This is done.  He’s done.  Things have come full circle, telling you would only…”His machine’s hands moved.  Everyone, myself included, tensed.One hand moved, palm upward, elbow pointed down.  A one-armed shrug.“…Multiply the grudge,” Cradle finished his sentence.Rain’s hand and one arm were my focus here, as I grit my teeth and tried not to be distracted.  He was cut up pretty badly- defensive wounds, with the degree of damage hard to discern.  The way cloth draped and the hand-coverings he wore obscured things.  Like his teeth, the blood ran between the decorative elements of his glove.His other hand had cuts, ones I might have called serious, if not for the fact that I was having to look at things in totality.  If Crystal had cut her hand like that on an ordinary day, in some hypothetical universe where she tried and failed to use a real knife, I would be rushing her to the hospital.  As it was?  Low priority.There were cuts on his chest- I’d look at those after.  Vista was tending to his leg, which was as bad as the arm.“Multiply the grudge?” Capricorn asked.  He stood between us and Cradle.“You’d walk away wanting to kill against me and against any co-conspirators I named.  You go after me, after them, and assuming they have friends and contacts, assuming you succeeded, those contacts would go after you.  Each time, it becomes something bigger, until one side gets wiped out.  Let’s end it here.”“What do you think is going to happen, Cradle?” Capricorn asked.  He was incredulous as he asked, “You really think I’m going to walk away when you’ve done this to my friend?”“What I want to happen, is for Operator Red and I to walk away.  You walk away, and leave the Fallen asshole here.  Your friend killed my friend and clustermate, the scales are even, we can resent each other and still never see each other again.”Capricorn barked out a laugh.“I hate that kind of life-death calculus,” Sveta murmured.  Not loud enough to be heard by Cradle.  Her focus was more on Rain and on herself.  Her tendrils kept groping at the more ragged edges of her shell, then pulling away, sometimes bending them in or twisting them around.I focused on Rain’s more damaged hand and arm as I attached the belt.  He fought me, struggling as I tightened the belt, which made the pain in my left arm all the worse… but the fight wasn’t nearly as intense as I wanted it to be.  A more intense fight in response to what had to be agonizing pain would mean there was more life in him.This tourniquet would have to do.  I was pretty sure I was good to go if the risk from blood loss -real and present-outweighed the damage from amputation.“I don’t think they’re going to do that, boss.  They look ticked,” Operator Red said.  He was still holding on to one of the Cradle-machine’s fingers.  He dropped, and fell about ten feet to land on his feet, legs bent.  He straightened, and Chris moved forward a step.Chris looked back with one bulbous, dark eye.  He had no expression to read.  There was only armor and coarse hair, and a long snout with eyes set on the side, the head more fishlike in dimension than mammal.  His eye protruded and narrowed, more conelike than round as it pointed in Rain’s direction.“Let me turn the question back on you, Capricorn,” Cradle said.  “How do you want this to go?  A fight?  You all fight me and Operator Red, you get your vengeance on behalf of your murderer friend, and this makes it better?”“Might help,” Chris hissed the words.  Broad blades with a swirling damascus-style blend of white bone and steel were emerging from his various armor plates.  Retractable weaponry, but not in a quick way.The ‘Keen’ part of Keen Vigilance.“It might,” Capricorn said.  “But if you really think it was justice, how about we… leave?  We arrest you, we go talk to authorities, and if you’re right, if it is justice, you’ll be free to go.”“Free to go.  I’m sure,” Cradle’s voice was quieter, not because he was quieter, but because he’d shifted position, turning his back to us as he straightened up.  He turned back to us, and his voice was stronger,  “You don’t see the hypocrisy?  How wrong it would be for him to be free while we’re in custody?  He killed people.  He laughed about it, to my face, to Love Lost’s, to Snag’s.”“He turned himself in,” Capricorn retorted.  “He tried.  At the first opportunity, he left the camp and went to confess.  He was so twisted up about it he wasn’t coherent.  They had him talk to people, but he couldn’t say much.  I guess because of Mama Mathers.”“He tell you that too?  I was always fifty-fifty on it being a lie,” Cradle said.  his tone was so casual and conversational, even pleased with himself.  Maybe he was, with Rain bleeding out.“It’s true,” Sveta said.I focused on what I could do.  Cuts marked Rain’s upper chest, shoulders, and stomach, until there wasn’t much of his top that wasn’t wet and shiny with blood.  In one place where the cuts ran in horizontal parallel, the flesh had come away in a ribbon, the ribbon dangling toward the ground.  I fixed it as best as I could, pressing a hand down on the wound.It felt futile.The wounds to his right leg were as bad as the defensive wounds to his hand.  I could assume they were early wounds, intended to keep him from running.  Vista was bandaging them with strips of cloth.There was only so much I could do.  I could go through two first aid kits and still run out of material to to bandage and tourniquet this.  I staunched the wounds with my hands, as best as I was able.“Capricorn,” I said.  He turned his head.  My voice was tense as I asked, “Can you use your power?  A cast, or something to seal the wounds?”The first orange lights appeared.Cradle kept talking, like we weren’t trying to save a life. “He killed Love Lost’s daughter.  The girl’s friend died too, and another one is devastated, even after a year.”“He knows!” Capricorn said, raising his voice.  “He went to the authorities!  He wants punishment!  He wanted jail, because it would at least get him away from this, except you all were coming after him, Mama Mathers had him locked down with her power.”And because there wasn’t necessarily room, I presumed.  If it was as serious as Cradle was saying, though…“That way doesn’t work, this way does,” Cradle said. “Tidier.”Operator Red clicked his tongue, “Tidy is high praise.”“Oh, fuck you,” Capricorn said.“This is a fucked up way to go about it,” I growled the words, adding my anger to Capricorn’s.  “This is barbaric.”Cradle, despite being younger than I was, managed to sound condescending.  “The Fallen are barbaric, and your friend was right there with them.  He locked us in a shopping mall and let us burn.  Snag lost the last mementos he had of family and the old world.  Snag was left with nothing, no escape, only his life… and your teammate got around to taking that from him too.”“Move your hands,” Capricorn said, glancing back at me.I took my hands away.  The orange solidified into an encasement around Rain’s arm and hand.  I put my hand to the edge, felt the gap- too much space.  It wasn’t a tight enough fit to staunch the blood or keep things contained.  I looked at Capricorn and shook my head.“You suck at first aid,” Chris hissed.  He cleaved at his sash, and the contents fell to the ground.  The containers were like tupperware, but metal, with rubberized lids, apparently color coded.  I reached for the nearest one.“Careful what you touch,” Chris hissed.  “Green lid.  Open.”I grabbed it, prying the lid off.  It was a tight fit.Syringes.  There was colored tape around various syringes, no labels, no words.  A foam insert had been carved at in a rough way, to give the needles places to fit in.“Red band.  Coagulant.  Use little.”“What are you doing?” Cradle asked.“How little?” I asked.“Maybe half inch.”A half inch as a unit of measurement for a liquid?“It won’t save him,” Chris hissed.  “Might help.”“Why do you have this?” Sveta asked.“One day I change, come apart instead of changing back.”I prepared the needle, holding it over Rain’s heart.Chris nodded.“Stop,” Cradle said.“The man said stop,” Operator Red said.“Didn’t want to use,” Chris was quiet.  “I like him more than most of you.”I plunged the syringe in.“Operator,” Cradle said.“Yeah,” Operator Red said.Operator paced forward.  Chris put himself in the guy’s way, the eye I could see opening wide, ears going back.I pressed the plunger down.  Half of an inch.  I pulled it free before anything could happen to make me put in more than was necessary.“Combat thinker!” Sveta called out.“Aw fuck,” Capricorn swore.“Cradle has invisible weapons!” I added.“Fuck!” Capricorn said, as orange trails surrounded his hands.  He gave Cradle a nervous glance.Cradle, at least for right now, was hanging back, letting his hired assassin do the dirty work.Operator reached behind his back, drawing another meat cleaver.  He flicked it around, so it rolled off the back of his hand, and he caught the handle, with the blade beneath his fist.Capricorn created his weapons.  Two swords of the stone material.  He thrust one in Operator’s direction, and was almost immediately disarmed of it.He held the other out, to keep Operator more at bay.  Orange lights danced around us without any seeming rhyme or reason.  I left Rain behind and took flight, going high above Operator.“Put the needle back,” Chris hissed, more insistent than before.“Are you serious?” I asked.“I need it,” he said.  He put his arm in Operator’s way.  The cleaver bit deep into an armor plate.  Operator ducked low, swinging under Chris’ arm.A blade at Chris’ elbow extended as he clenched a large, brutish fist, and he drove his elbow back.  The two cleaver blades caught the elbow-blade, and Operator was pushed back toward the door.No sign that he’d lost his balance or been caught off guard in any way.I reversed course, dropping to the ground.  I placed the needle in the foam insert, and then started to replace the lid.“Victoria!” Capricorn called out.I looked to Operator first- the most immediate threat, and then I heard the crash.  Metal fingers and hands reaching up to the roof, finding a grip where it had been bolted or hammered to a broader wooden beam, and then crumpling it.Water poured unevenly throughout the barn as hands that could have wrapped around a small car brought down the roof.  Beams cracked and split.I flew for the largest, most pressing part of the roof, and the beam that was attached to it.  The walls were shuddering in a way that made me think the entire barn could come down.Cradle had apparently lost patience.The Wretch and I hit the roof in Cradle’s machine hand with enough force that it would take a couple of minutes to walk to wherever it landed.Sveta, Rain and Vista weren’t in the building anymore.  Sveta had dragged them out through the open door.  Capricorn and Chris were facing down Operator Red, and Cradle loomed in the hole in the roof he’d made, looking up at me.He swiped a hand in my general direction, coming almost ten feet shy of connecting.  I put the Wretch up anyway.  I glanced at what was happening below- Vista was distorting space, keeping Operator Red in the building and giving Chris and Capricorn time to escape.  Chris was delaying his escape.Something hit me like a truck, knocking the Wretch out and knocking me almost twenty feet through the air, before I could right myself.Cradle turned, his attention on those on the ground.  A lot of strength in those mechanical hands.  There had to be a good fifty feet of armspan when the two longest arms were extended, and he had a lot of arms.  He hopped over to one of the shorter arms- almost just a wrist that connected to the central hub, and stepped onto the hand, where he crouched with the hand cupped around him.I flew at him before he could do whatever he planned to do to the others, my aura down.  A hand came up, intercepting me, and I hit it.  The building creaked and crumbled as hands twisted and wrenched at wood to maintain his position.  He turned his attention back to me.Another swipe of the hands.  I flew down, away from the direction of the swipe, and again, something collided with me, knocking me downward at an angle this time.“Looksee,” I said,“Mm?” was the response, small and emotional.She’d seen Rain.“Can your cameras see-”I flew to evade as the hands moved.  They weren’t moving my way, but to get him oriented, as he closed on the others.  I changed course, flying more toward Cradle himself.Two hands came up, one to either side of Cradle himself, as if they were going to slam together, catching me in the middle.They didn’t.  I hit something, a field or barrier between the hands.  It didn’t hit the Wretch so much as it dashed the Wretch to pieces, with me bouncing fifteen or twenty feet back.  The hands came after me, and I flew to evade.“Can you see what he’s doing?” I asked.“I think so,” Looksee said.  “I need the projector disc, and you need to connect it to my camera, it’s easy to do, and I need to get it ready.”Operator Red had exited out the far end of the building, and was circling around.  I wondered if Capricorn’s power had given him pause.  Chris was only just now going out the door that the others had left by.  He had the cloth bundle with his boxes and things.A… mess of emergency measures, it looked like, for a boy who thought he might fall apart with any transformation, but who had no choice but to transform.I had to get past Cradle to get to him, and I had to get to him to get the projector.Sveta hauled Rain a distance off to one side, his back to her chest as she used herself almost as a sled, for the easier ride.  She pulled herself to a fence.I could see Cradle’s thought process, as he considered going after her, as he turned his mind to the others- to Vista, to Capricorn, and more specifically, to Chris.The hand came down, a good distance from Chris.  Chris, a mound of armored, furred flesh, hopped, ducking and rolling, as the entire area around him was demolished.  Dirt and soil became a cloud of particles and mud, as something smashed into it and sent the destroyed ground up ten feet in the air.And as it settled, splattering against one outside corner of the barn, and everything around them, Chris was there, moving slower than an ordinary person might run, with short, heavy running steps.Vista was using her power to create distance.  Cradle crossed that distance by leaping, each hand pushing against ground or the edge of the barn, with one hand up and outstretched, ready to come down on top of them.I flew after him, and it was easier to close the distance when Vista was using her power.I reached him just as he’d almost reached them.  Then his hand came down early, touched ground, and his entire form rotated, a second hand grazing the ground, turning the landing into a cartwheel, one of the longer arms coming around my way.Whatever he hit me with caught me and knocked me down into muddy field.  The landing reawakened the pain in my arm, to the point where I felt the sensation swell, my body telling me that passing out was a possibility.Not a possibility, body.Chris having run off to one side and Cradle being fixated on Capricorn and Vista meant I could reach Chris.  I flew to him, landing.“You can see what he’s doing?” I asked.He gave me a single nod, and his eyes opened wide, ears twitching.“Of course,” I said.  “Projector disc?”He tapped the sash he’d made with the cloth bundle.  The disc was a belt buckle, as large as a dinner plate, as thick as a textbook.“Looksee wants it,” I said.Operator Red was on the approach, jogging our way with cleavers in hand.  Cradle- fixated on the others.  Vista was trying to keep both opponents at bay by increasing the distance between them and everyone else.Chris managed to get the disc free.  He passed it to me, then turned toward Operator Red.The thing with Vista’s distance power was that the closer two people were to one another, the harder it was for her to utilize the distance that remained.“Keep backing up,” I said.I flew straight up.“We have a teammate who needs help,” Looksee said, in my ear.“I know,” I said.  Sveta still had Rain.  He wasn’t moving much.  She could have left with him, but I wasn’t sure that kind of movement was any good for him.  “But if I leave with him, I’m not sure I won’t come back to more of the same.”It was already so dark out.  The clouds were heavier, even though there was barely any precipitation anymore.  In the gloom, Capricorn’s lights and the glowing points at the joints and knuckles of Cradle’s robot were eerily bright.Equally as bright, Looksee’s camera flew to me.  Football sized, with a round lens on the front.“How do I do this?”“Attach it on front.  Press it on, rotate.  Like a smoke detector.”I wasn’t sure I’d used a smoke detector with that setup, but I could guess how it was intended to go.The entire thing thrummed as the connection was made, the small, quarter-sized lens in the middle of the projector disc illuminating.“Not much battery,” Looksee said.  “You can let it go.  There’s going to be a time delay.  It’s not accurate.”“Okay,” I said.  I dropped it.  It fell a short distance before taking flight on its own.“Help- help everyone.”“I’ll try,” I said.“I wish I could do more,” Looksee said.So did I.I flew after Cradle.I could see it now.  Cords or cables, normally transparent, were illuminated in red light.  There was lag, the light tracing one cord that extended from each fingertip, snapping to another position when it fell out of sync.“Annoying,” Cradle said.  “Doesn’t change anything.”He raised a hand, bringing it down from overhead, in Capricorn’s direction.I flew in, and I used the wretch to hit and deflect.Again, that unreasonably intense force, exploding out and away, as the impact hit the Wretch and the aftershock cascaded out to thrust me away in the air.The attack was off course- not so much it couldn’t have hit Capricorn, but he’d seen me coming and had moved away.Vista was a short distance off, using her power.  They’d decided being split up was better, and I knew her power was best when she was alone.She wasn’t using her ability on Cradle’s robot.  Was it immune?He kept going after them, trusting his robot to deal with me.  I didn’t have a lot of tools.  Some ideas, now that I thought about it, but…I’d try for the most basic, tried, and true option.“Cradle!” I called out.He glanced back at me, but he continued to ignore me.I grit my teeth, scowling briefly, and flew in.  His hand came out, and the red lights showed me the rough path of the cables.  They moved like a flail would, delayed, swinging out in a lazy arc, the five cables fanning out as they cut through the air.I could evade, draw closer- and the hand itself got in my way.  As I moved, so did it, staying between Cradle and I.I was quicker than the hand, and I could change my path and catch him off guard, but other hands moved, complicating things.  It would be too easy for hands to close in around me.Above me, cables were swung up, and they connected to another hand, extending from the fingertips of one hand to the fingertips of another.That’d be the barrier I ran into, then.As I flew around, they broke free, snapping out with more force than a swing would provide.  They hit me- hit the Wretch, and knocked us off course.I shouted at a volume that made my throat hurt, “You left yourself out, Cradle!”Again, another glance my way, before he turned his focus to other things.“He did all that to Love Lost and Snag, he didn’t do anything to you?”I chose those words with some intent.  Not just to ask what Rain did, but to imply there was nothing, and invite the retort.“He took people and things from them!” Cradle roared out his response, so he could be heard.  “He took me from me!”With that last exclamation, it was an actual show of emotion- not that he hadn’t said emotional things, but it was the first time he’d put the emotion out there.Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Chris sit down rather heavily, clawed hands raised.  He was bleeding in multiple places, and he didn’t have any fight left in him.Operator Red turned toward the rest of us, and walked away from Chris, cleavers in hand.Combat thinkers.  Worse in a lot of ways than fighting someone like my mom, with her energy weapons.  She could slice a grown man in half with her weapons.  A combat thinker?  There were ones who could hammer at you psychologically by mirroring mannerisms of people you knew or feared, ones who could hit your nerves or arteries any time, with any strike or weapon they had at hand, and there were ones who could win most fights without trying, because they had the fighting skills without working for those skills, combat precognition, or they saw the fight move at a hundredth the speed.I was mentally slotting this asshole in that broader ‘win without trying’ category.  There might have been some of the former, though, if Snag’s team been drawn to him.  The awareness of biology and weak points could both help in combat and in torture.“He took you from you?” I asked Cradle, keeping one eye on Operator.  Cradle was looking up at me.I did have his attention now.  Objective achieved, I guessed.“I was getting everything set up, finally living the life I wanted to live, and he fucked it all up.  He pulled me into this, he infected me, and now I’m different!”I opened my mouth to respond, to retort, bait out more and keep Cradle’s attention, so we could figure out a way to get Rain away.  If Vista could get to Sveta and Rain- and it looked like she was heading that way-“He violated my self!” Cradle’s words were more raw than any others I’d heard from him.  Angrier.My train of thought stopped where it was, as Cradle’s words entered my head and overrode everything else.  In those four words, I got Cradle.There were so many responses I wanted to give, about everything from the preceding events, the event, and everything that followed…It was upbringing.  Really questionable upbringing, sometimes or even a lot of the time.He was in a bad place, desperate, with nobody to turn to.He regrets it.  He’s trying to do better.  He was willing to turn himself in, even though that wasn’t what Cradle wanted or needed.He didn’t want any of this any more than Cradle did.It wasn’t him that screwed with Cradle like that.  It was the power, acting according to some alien programming.No.There wasn’t one response I could give without feeling like I might be compromising my integral self.Well, there was one response.“Yeah,” I said.  “I… yeah.”He was too far away to properly hear me.I nodded, instead.“If you understand, let him die!”This time, I shook my head.“No,” I said, knowing he couldn’t hear.That would violate my integral self too.  Just as much.  More.He moved a hand, and the red-highlighted cables swung out, and connected to the ends of other cables, which separated from other fingertips.  One hand now had cables of double the length.He repeated the process again.Arming himself for combat.Chris was okay, it seemed, limping toward the fight.  Operator was crawling toward Capricorn and Vista, who had reunited, and who were only a short distance from Sveta.  Vista was more focused on making the way between Operator and them as steep as possible.Operator’s cleavers periodically stabbed into the earth for handholds, as he trudged through muddy field at a forty degree incline.Cradle swiped his cables at me.  I flew back and away, evading.  He swiped again, a backhand, and I barely needed to evade.Not meant for me.  He’d swiped at the camera.The camera dodged.The hand shook, and cables reconfigured.  The one at the middle finger was longer.One swipe, angled to connect with either me or the camera.  I hit it with the Wretch, and saw the crimson highlighting twist and distort, as the camera struggled to keep up with the outline of the cable.The cable hit the ground around the base of Cradle’s robot, and the soil exploded with the impact.  Again, that surrounding force.His version of Rain’s power.  Or something he’d begged and borrowed for, maybe, another tinker’s tech, modified to work with his gear.  That was a thing tinkers could do- a thing that drove them into tinker enclaves or the PRT.  Past tense ‘drove’.That effect meant I couldn’t catch it, but I could still deflect.  Where things got harder was that I wasn’t sure of the fallout now.  The cord was over a hundred feet long now, the arm was twenty five or so feet long, and even if I knocked the cord to one side, I couldn’t be sure it wouldn’t land in a way that put it near teammates.I closed the distance.  There were still other cables, and if I couldn’t control the whip-The hand came up.  I flew to intercept, and hit the back of the hand as hard as I could, before it reached the momentum necessary to flick the whip.  The impact dented the surface of the hand, but didn’t stop it from raising up, catching me as it rose.  The movement was too slow for the impact to hurt, but it was an impact, and that impact made my gunshot wound hurt more.  Again, there was that suggestion that I could pass out if I let myself.I maneuvered with more care, aura blasting to try to distract Cradle, for all the good it did.A tinker who’d had a year to prepare, a team funneling him resources, and apparently a bit of talent to boot.A hand moved to shield an attack from the side.  Something crashed against the hand, and Cradle turned his head to look.Capricorn’s power.  Water had splashed against the hand and then turned to stone.A moment later, there was another.The hand closed, and the stone broke.I flew back and up a little, to get a better vantage point.Capricorn was with Vista and Sveta.  Capricorn was creating a sphere somewhere between the size of a beachball and basketball, though spikier than either.  Sveta grabbed it, used her power to fling it from fifty feet behind her to Cradle.Stone became water, which became stone immediately after impact.Operator’s advance had been stymied, as the top of the hill folded up and overhead, creating a ridge he couldn’t climb. He was going around, which only served to give them more time.Cradle moved his whip hand.  I smacked it down, then evaded the various cables that swung in my direction, while I waited for the Wretch to return.Chris was closing the distance, slow as he was, approaching the hands.  Capricorn unleashed another shot.  The shot clipped the top of a finger, splashing well over Cradle’s head, and then the water became stone.  Each bit of water was now a stone smaller than a fist, raining down on Cradle’s head.Vista shouted something.Good.Good, this was the part I liked, that didn’t make me miserable.  Having a team.  Finding a way to work together and mesh, solving problems.I just wished it wasn’t at the expense of time.I struck an arm again- getting past the endless barriers was next to impossible, especially when the cables were whipping around and I was vulnerable right after any impact.  This hit was aimed at destabilizing, putting him on tilt, so he had to adjust, shift weight, and move arms around.Capricorn and Sveta had been delivering the projectiles at a fairly steady rate.  Now there was a pause.“Above,” I heard through my earphone.I got out of dodge.One shot, larger than the others, fired so high it had disappeared into the clouds.  Now it came down, and the descent was guided by my favorite space warper.Cradle put a hand over his head.The stone became water at the last moment, but the impact was still enough that the hand came dangerously close to the top of Cradle’s head.  Water filtered between the fingers in streams- and then froze, like the bars of a cage around him.I flew in, straight for him.He hurled himself at the bars, at the same moment hands moved apart and the stone shattered.  The bars had broken just in time that he didn’t collide with them.  A hand moved to provide footing below him as he descended, bobbed to absorb the impact of the fall.Was that intuitive sense of how to stay steady on his contraption his mover power?It had cost him time, and he was purely on the defensive.  Chris was climbing up one arm- something Cradle could have easily dealt with, if he wasn’t dealing with all of us.I glanced at Operator, thinker-one bird’s eye view at work, and saw that he was at the edge of Vista’s wave-shaped crest of earth.  A few more steps and he’d be able to walk around it and charge them.  Vista had been too distracted guiding the stone from above to keep tabs on the guy.“Operator incoming!” I shouted.An arm moved- not the hand or the arm itself, but the elbow that came at me.  I deflected.Every second we couldn’t end this was a second Rain was bleeding.  I was worried at how long it had been already.  I could have flown, but I would have been leaving the others at Cradle’s mercy.I renewed my efforts, taking more risks, as I flew in closer.“Don’t dodge,” I heard another report.  Looksee.Don’t dodge?Capricorn and Sveta hurled another projectile.  A hand blocked it, then shook off the stone.  Other hands were warring with Chris, who was slowly climbing, stabbing, and doing a better job than I was at keeping tabs on everything immediately around him.  It was another distraction for Cradle, but I doubted our changer would manage to get in close if I couldn’t, situational awareness or no.Speaking of- what was I not supposed to dodge?“Looksee?” I asked.“One second, fiddling!”Fiddling.I got within ten feet of Cradle, only for a hand to block me.  I flew around it- and he wasn’t there anymore.He’d hopped down to another hand.The whip hand moved, and I moved to counter.  I struck it, closer to the elbow than the hand, and the hand slapped down toward the ground.I went straight from that hit to flying for Cradle, to keep him on his toes and create room for a mistake.A blur of red in my peripheral vision gave me pause.The long whip?  It was falling down on top of everything.  Cradle saw it too, moved hands to provide a shield.I trusted the Wretch, and used the opportunity to hammer him.The red line passed through everything.  Projection.  A feint.  Cradle had an intuitive sense of where things were, but seeing the red lines had preconditioned him, toyed with that perception as an optical illusion, and with that deception, I could get close enough to make contact.I grabbed him by the fabric at his back and hauled him up and away.“Victoria,” I heard Tattletale over the phone call.“Stop breaking in, please,” I heard Looksee’s reply.I flew Cradle away from his machine, and dropped him harder than was necessary, relatively close to the others.Operator was still trying to navigate the Vista-modified battlefield.  He’d managed to dodge some traps already, ground cupping over him like a dome, pitfalls.“Call off Operator,” I said.Cradle was silent.“Call him off!”“I need him intact and free,” Tattletale said, over the phone.“Get bent,” I said.“I’m willing to negotiate,” she said.“Set him in stone,” I suggested, to Capricorn.  “Leave him for the Fallen when they come back.”Cradle tensed.“You’re not going to do that,” Tattletale said.  “You’re too righteous.”“Wah!” was the distant shout.I turned to look.  It was Chris, and Cradle’s robot was still operating.  The whip hand was moving-I flew to intercept, as the whip came around.  I knocked it away.“Again… we can leave you for the Fallen,” I told Cradle.  “Or you can call Operator off.”“Red!” Cradle called out.  “Enough.”That meant the assassin wasn’t an immediate concern.“How’s our guy?” I asked.“Not good,” Sveta said.  She pressed her forehead to Rain’s.  “He’s not really breathing.  He’s cold.”“Advance Guard.  They have a healer,” Tattletale said.“I know,” I said, annoyed.  “Go away.  You led them right to him, didn’t you?  Through our video and phones?”“Yes, but not like that.  It doesn’t matter.”“It matters,” I said.  I bent down by Rain.  Capricorn gave me a hand in scooping him up.  I checked to make sure the robot was being good.“We can handle this now,” Capricorn said.  “Get him help.”I nodded.I flew.  Advance Guard had been to the northern end of everything, where a road exited the settlement.  There were some sparse buildings in that direction, but it looked to be mainly for logging and maybe some quarrying as well.“Victoria,” Tattletale said.“I can kick her off,” Looksee said.  “I think I figured it out now.”“I’ll talk to her,” I said.“The Crowleys came out ahead in this.  I know they’ve got a reputation that makes people underestimate them, but their own people were just attacked.  They’ll be out for blood, and the Fallen have far more reach than you’d imagine.”“I don’t know what you’re getting at,” I said.  I checked my charge.  Rain was limp.  No fight, no response to anything.“Let Cradle go.  I’ll keep him and Love Lost out of your way.  He promised to help me after I helped him here.  Do that for me and I will help you.”“You were talking about the Fallen.”“I’ll coordinate.  I can get you March and what’s left of Prancer’s band.  The Crowleys are already on their way out, they’re hitting the road, we can hit them before they get where they’re going.”“I don’t know what games you’re playing, Tattletale, but one of mine might be dead.  Someone I pledged to help and keep alive.  You pointed the killers to him.  You were a cog in Snag and Prancer’s thing, and that turned out pretty shitty.  How much of that was intentional?”“That’s the kind of conspiracy thinking that gets you put in an institution,” Tattletale said.“Either you’re incompetent or you’re malicious,” I said.  “Neither lends themselves to us working together.“Or I’m wrestling with bigger things, Victoria,” she sighed out the words, sounding exasperated, annoyed.I spotted the first glimmer of color in the trees.  I flew closer.“I made my offer.  Feel free to accept it,” she said.“She’s gone,” Looksee said.There was a pause.“Is he really that bad?” she asked.“I don’t know,” I said.  I wasn’t willing to spare the time to check, either.  “But if this doesn’t work-”I didn’t finish the sentence.If this doesn’t work, thinking about all the responses I couldn’t give Cradle… would I be willing to try another route?Another healer?I dropped down the rest of the way, through the largest gap in the foliage.Not Advance Guard.  Prancer and his team- half the size it had been, and that was after the defection of Beast of Burden.Prancer had no Velvet at his side, and he had no Moose.  He did have a dark expression on his face, one that darkened further as he recognized me.“Advance Guard?” I asked.He pointed.Northeast.No fight, no resistance.  I just hoped he hadn’t lied.He hadn’t lied.  Advance Guard was with the patrol block, and the patrol block was trying to corral a hero team and somewhat hostile evacuees who outnumbered them four to one.I landed in the center of the camp.I spotted Mayday with Gilpatrick.“Healer?” I asked.I saw the hesitation, and my heart sank.  The sick feeling was worse.“Is your healer hurt?” I asked.“He’s- he’s here,” Mayday said.  “Unhurt.”“But?”“But everything went to shit,” Mayday said.  “Come.”I followed, giving Gilpatrick a look over my shoulder.  He was already talking to others, the moment Mayday was gone.  Things to do, people to coordinate.  It looked like other leaders of other patrols, that he was helping to coordinate.One of the buses had the remnants of Advance Guard around it.  Mayday hopped up and hauled on the lever to open the emergency door of the bus.  Capes converged, ready to guardThe cape wore a goat mask, golden, and a black costume.  He sat on one of the benches of the bus.  There were others in the bus, men and women in cuffs.Now that I looked, the cape had cuffs on as well.“This is Scapegoat,” Mayday said.  “He can heal.  Sort of.  It’s complicated.”“It always is.  What happened, Scapegoat?” I asked.  I used flight to stead myself as I dropped low.“I don’t know,” he said.“He went Fallen,” someone supplied.“He’s not the only one,” Mayday said.  “We had one other, who died in the scrap.  A lot of people were looking for answers after the end of the world, and the Fallen were promising them.”Scapegoat shrugged.Reach, as Tattletale had put it.I wanted to ask him things, to shake him, to push for more than a shrug.  I imagined a lot of people did.But I needed his help.I draped Rain out on the road.  Scapegoat looked down at him.“Hey,” I said.  I pressed a finger to his pulse.I couldn’t tell if there was something there or if it was my feeling my own pulse reverberating through.But he moved.  His head shifted slightly as he looked at me, eyes flickering as he tried to open them – but one was cut and the other was crusted with blood.“I want someone to heal you,” I said.  “Okay?  Hey.  I need your okay.”I saw his head move a fraction, then again.When he tried again, there was more of a nod.I looked up at Scapegoat.  He looked away, looked at Mayday.“You want to play games, Scapegoat?” Mayday asked.“Not games,” Scapegoat said, voice soft.  “But I’ve helped you a lot already, and it doesn’t seem like my situation is any better.  My power sucks to use.”“I got a message from Tattletale,” Looksee reported, coming in over the phone.  “Tell Scapegoat Tattletale says to, and that he needs the goodwill.  He needs a lot of it.”I didn’t hesitate.  “Tattletale.  She says to.  You need goodwill, here.”He paused.A tense moment later, he nodded, crouched, and held his hands over Rain.  He looked up at Mayday.  “Can you get him warm?”“We have blankets,” Mayday said.  “Shortcut, grab some.”I didn’t look for my would-be nemesis; my focus was on Rain and on Scapegoat, making sure Rain was safe, as flickering images overlapped with him.“You’ll need help too?” Scapegoat asked.My gunshot wound.  He’d seen the bloody bandages.“No,” I said.  “I’ll heal it naturally.”He seemed to take that in a matter of fact way.There were more things to handle.  Tattletale wanted to cooperate to wrap this up in a better way, and I was not ready to forget or forgive her role in this.  I didn’t want to engage in life and death calculus, as Sveta had put it.I pressed a hand to my ear, so it was clearer that I was talking to someone.“Looksee, I’m not sure if you can see-”“I can’t.  My cameras are down or repurposed.”“I think he’s getting the help he needs, okay?”“Okay.”The minutes passed as the injuries disappeared.  Ashley joined us, with Gilpatrick standing behind her.  Her power sparked a few times, and Scapegoat said something.  She moved to situate herself further back, in a place where she could still watch.I wasn’t sure what to say or do- a smile felt wrong, I couldn’t think of what to say that wouldn’t be too casual, too personal, or too confrontational.I raised a hand in a bit of a wave.  She did the same with her good hand.For now, I could put everything out of mind for the moment.  At the very least, I’d stand watch over Rain like nobody watched over me.“Looksee,” I said, hand at my ear.“Yeah?”“Tell Tattletale I’m willing to consider it, but I want something else on the table.”“Yeah?”“We’re going to need more explanations.  I want to know what the hell is going on.”                                                                                        Pitch – 6.6                                                                                        Narwhal faced down the Fallen, standing in the middle of the road.  A crowd of patrol block soldiers stood behind her, with the buses lined up.The soldiers with guns were only slightly less intimidating than the array of forcefields she’d conjured up, arranged above and to either side of her with the blades pointing forward, each one slightly tilted in angle compared to the one next to it, so they all pointed at the one point ahead of us.I floated above her.“It’s over,” Narwhal called out.  “The Crowleys are running, the Mathers leadership is gone.  Half of your town was leveled and legitimate authorities are going to be staying there to make sure everything’s healthy as people move back in.”And we’ll provide some resources to anyone that wants out for good, I thought.  I hope that pans out.“Healthy,” the Fallen woman in the lead said.  “Healthy food is stuff you have to choke down.  Healthy body means doing grueling work.  That’s you saying it’s going to fucking suck.”Yeah, she didn’t look like someone who ate her vegetables.“I’ve done this kind of thing before.  I fought warlords,” Narwhal said.  “I helped the villages after.  I delivered supplies to isolated settlements.  A lot of people want this to have a happy ending, and experience tells me that ending is possible.”A guy called out, “The only happy ending I want is the kind you use your hand for, bitch!”There was some raucous, tense laughter from the group.I felt such disgust, looking at them.  It wasn’t the joke- I could imagine Chris or Rain saying something like that and it being something that pushed the envelope.  They wouldn’t have said ‘bitch’, though.I couldn’t understand them.My phone buzzed.  I flew to the ground, off to the side of Narwhal, and brought my phone to my ear.“Tattletale here.  Can we talk?”“Standoff with the remaining Mathers Fallen and Narwhal,” I said.  I assessed the situation.  “I think Narwhal has it handled.”“I’d think so.  I’ve found the Crowleys, they covered their retreat, and now they’re on the move.  They borrowed a fleet of cars from a town north of here, and they’re heading east.”“East?  Boston?  New Brockton?”“I’m betting the Boston district of the Megalopolis,” she said.  “They’re taking a route using roads that are barely roads, they’re so rustic.  If you take the major highway, you could get ahead of them with time to spare.  Give me what I need and we’ll help.”“We being?”“Undersiders.  I can twist Prancer’s arm, promise to help him bounce back if he’ll lend me people.  I could also give you the information for March.  She’d help, but it would have to come from you, not me.”“Do I want her help?”“She’d do the job and she’d do it well, if she thought it would help Rain.”“But?” I asked.  I was still keeping an eye on the situation with Narwhal and the Fallen.“You know the Graeae twins?  They’re part of her group.”“A bit.  They helped Rain out.”“They were two of three, originally.  They had another brother, and they’re triplets and cluster-mates at the same time.  Big bro went off the deep end.  Kiss and kill are messy enough when you’ve got family bonds, but the brother went full kiss, full kill, at the same time, like where the venn diagram overlaps.”I felt my skin crawl, and darker thoughts bubbled up, as I drew some parallels.  I kept my voice level as I said, “I’ve read about that.”“Whichever order that goes in, it’s… it’s not good, Victoria.”“Thanks,” I said, my voice curt.  “Let’s speed along to the explanation.”“With my power, I can usually figure people out.  With March, I can’t.  When that happens, it’s because there is no answer, or I’m asking the wrong question.”That was more information than I’d ever had about Tattletale’s power and its limitations.“You should know I’m baring my throat and showing you some weaknesses as a gesture of good faith,” Tattletale said.Or as a manipulation tactic.I watched the Fallen advance a little, but kept up my end of the call.  In a pinch, I would fly in and stall.  I drew out the thrust of Tattletale’s explanation, something that I seemed to have to do with regularity.  “You think you can’t figure out if March is one or the other because she’s both?”“Or neither, but saying it’s neither would mean it’s so far afield it’s not sensible.  Which would fit her.  Either way, if she really likes someone, that isn’t a good thing.”“You’re saying not to rely on her, then?”“Know what you’re getting into.  She’d be useful to have if you pick this fight.  It’s a lot of Fallen and they’ll be going to somewhere there are friends.”“Understood,” I said.  I was distracted as I replied; the Fallen were more agitated now.“We know they’re projections!” the Fallen woman jeered.Narwhal looked at one of her team members.  I imagined it was the kind of disappointed look that went with a sigh.She looked at me, and I nodded.My phone beeped, loud.  I twisted my head around, burying my eyes in the crook of my elbow, bringing out the Wretch.The flash was so bright I could briefly see my bones through my arm, with everything else being a mottled pink.The Fallen were left partially or wholly blind.  Some screamed, others opened fire.  Narwhal already had her barrier up.  The forcefields glowed as they absorbed the fire.Our trap worked.“Sounds like you’re busy.  We’ll meet, and you can bring some of your people this time, if you want.  You can glare at me, I’ll fill you in on the why and the what.”“That’s only if we agree.”“Let’s keep this simple, Victoria.  I’m trying to play ball.”“You were ops for an assassin that came after my teammate.”“I’m trying to play ball with this.  If you put him in jail, I might have to break him out, or he’s going to break out on his own.  He’s a tinker, among other things.  The places they’ve got aren’t that good, trust me.”“If you or your people help him, we’re actually going to have a problem,” I said.  “But whether we release him in exchange for your help isn’t up to me.”“I’ll send you some stuff.  Use it to convince others.”⊙Captain Marcial scrolled through my phone logs.  Another captain, Gaymon, was standing next to her, arms folded, watching the screen.“Using this phone is a hassle,” Gaymon said.“I’d have given you better if I had better,” I said.  “She texted all that to me, and I don’t know how to put texts on a laptop, or where I would even get a laptop out here.”“Whatever,” Gaymon said.I frowned a bit, but I didn’t want to make an issue of things.  I knew some of the patrol blocks were more anti-cape than Gilpatrick’s, and Gaymon had given me that vibe and cemented it in place with his attitude.Gilpatrick, Sveta and Chris were next to me.  Ashley was a short distance away in the company of ‘Jester’, the both of them sitting on a rock by the ditch.  Rain was lying across the long seat at the rear end of a bus, resting and avoiding any and all disturbances after the attention from Scapegoat.Shortcut from Advance Guard was lurking around the periphery.  Thankfully, he was staying quiet and sticking to the background.“This Tattletale, you trust her?” Marcial asked.  She was a slim woman, with a nose that had been broken at least twice, and a thin old scar that parted her eyebrow.  Like Gilpatrick, she was ex-PRT.  She wore a raincoat that was open in the front, because it couldn’t close around her body armor.  The hood kept the drizzle off of her face.“No,” I said.  “I don’t really trust her.”“Not so compelling, then,” she said, looking back down at the phone.“It’s… not a point in her favor,” I said.  “But I’d rather operate under the assumption that she’s telling the truth about where the Fallen are and what they’re doing.  I’m going to go after them and, if she turns out to be right, put myself at risk.  If she’s wrong, I’m flying for a few hours when all I want to do is get my gunshot wound looked at.  Take that for what it’s worth.”“So you do trust her.”“I trust that the Fallen are dangerous.  That trust means I’m willing to accept the hassle and the risk.”“That Tattletale is yanking our dicks?” Captain Marcial asked, her voice about as uncaring and dry as was possible.“Yeah,” I said.“Children present,” Sveta said, quiet.  Her arms were folded, and one finger moved, pointing at Chris.“I don’t care,” Chris said.“I don’t care either,” Marcial said.  “If they can fight, they can hear some bad language.  This feels like a wild goose chase or a trap.  We’ve already been stung a few times.”“We know they went somewhere.  Our tinker thinks there’s reason to believe Tattletale is right.  They used guns today, multiple witnesses can testify they put civilians in the line of fire to use as human shields, and tortured others.  There’s a chance they bring that behavior to a settlement.  I think it’s worth using the only lead we have, after they slipped our perimeter.”“They being the Crowleys?”“Yes,” I said.  “Possibly with some scattered Mathers, and the Clans, and the remaining Bikers.”I wasn’t sure how keen the Bikers would be when it came to playing along, but I wasn’t going to bring that up.  Marcial’s approach wasn’t warming me to her, and I was reluctant to give her fuel for her suspicions and delaying tactics.  It was her call when it came to her patrol group and what they were prepared to do.  She had authority over her group in the field like Gilpatrick had for the Bridgeport patrol.I was keenly aware of Captain Marcial’s geographical position, as well.  She was in charge of the patrol block from New Haven.  They were the closest neighbors to the Mathers camp of Fallen.  The same town with the shop where I’d picked up the donuts, and with the people who’d been camped out watching for trouble, that Looksee had fooled and helped bring into custody.If anyone was going to turn out to be a Fallen sympathizer, a thing that was happening with some frequency, I wouldn’t be shocked if that anyone was Captain Marcial.“Crowleys aren’t on paper as being a big threat,” she said.“Crowleys aren’t on paper as having gun toting soldiers either,” I said.“We took the same road they did when we came here,” Chris said.  “You can smell the gunpowder in the air, mixed with the smell of cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline and body odor.”“You can, Chris,” Sveta said, stressing the ‘you’.Gaymon’s superior approached.  I’d caught the man being called Captain Bash, but I wasn’t sure if it was a nickname or real last name.  He didn’t look like a Bash, with a shorter than average stature, skinny physique and a bit of a receding hairline- I could imagine it being the sort of thing where a tall muscular man was nicknamed Tiny.  The PRT director in my hometown had confided in me at one point that she’d been nicknamed Lady, and from her lack of grace and finer manners, it might have been the same sort of thing.Bash indicated the phone, “What’s this?”“Villain says she knows where the Crowley bunch went, after Scapegoat helped them push past our perimeter.  Gilpatrick’s cape says they want to follow up on it.  If this is to be believed, the Fallen went north, to the Meridian stretch, and then they’ll go east.”“To a populated part of the city,” I pointed out.“And?” Bash asked.“We’re trying to decide if it’s worth going after the jackasses,” Gaymon said.“It’s more complicated than that.  We can get better info, but it costs,” I said.  “And I need the approval of my whole team on this, first.  I want to make sure we have the other resources we need if we’re going to pay this cost or convince the rest of my team.  If we can work with what we’ve got, though, that’d be ideal.”“I’ll defer to Gilpatrick and Marcial,” Bash said.  “You make the call, we’ll help, whatever happens.”“Again,” I said, trying not to let the combination of Chris and Bash sidetrack things too much, “We have witnesses.  They came armed and they fought hard.  This wasn’t the prankster, pain in the ass, public nuisance Crowleys.  This was something more vicious.”“Because they were defending their home?” Marcial suggested.“I trust her, Liz,” Gilpatrick said, speaking just a moment before I said something I would have regretted later.  “If she says it was serious, I believe her.”“This is your girl from the community center?”I frowned.“She is,” Gilpatrick said.“The wrecking ball.”Fuck me, was she trying to push me?“She kept my people alive and safe.  She protected civilians.  Considering the fudge-cluster that was, I’m happy with how she handled it.”“Disaster follows in your heroine’s wake, huh?” Marcial asked, still in that same dry tone.I closed my eyes, then measured out my response, “It’s my feeling that when you have powers, it’s your responsibility to take action in the face of disaster.  So yeah, you’re going to see me a lot on the scene of bad stuff going down.”“Cluster fudge, bad stuff,” Chris said.  “You don’t need to censor for my benefit.  I promise you, I’ve heard worse.  I’ve said worse.”“Don’t interrupt,” Sveta told him.“I understand that you’re defensive, Victoria.  You put a lot on the line,” Marcial said.“I’m not-” I started.  I clenched my fist.“It’s okay.  This is how I function.  Ask anyone who works under me.  I’m asking the questions others are going to ask after we’re done.  Why do this, are we sure, wasn’t there some indication it was a trap?  Succeed or fail, they’re going to wonder, and I intend to have the right answers for them.”“Okay,” I said, though I didn’t feel okay with it.  The annoying thing with how she ‘functioned’ was that I had a hard time going back and finding the thread of the conversation again.  Chris’ commentary didn’t help.  “Defending their home, you said.”“Mm hmm,” she said.  She looked at Gaymon as he nudged her.“The supporting images aren’t very clear,” Gaymon interrupted, holding up my phone.  “Especially on a screen this small.”“Yeah,” she acknowledged him.  “I don’t think anyone has satellite footage that’s worth three fucks, yet.”I pressed, “They were armed and ready for a small war.  This isn’t limited to the guns people brought with them and the rifles they had for hunting.  There were assault rifles and whole groups with a matching gun in each person’s hand.”“I bet if you asked them, they’d say it was a good thing they were armed and ready, since a small war came to them,” she said.  When she saw my expression, she added, “I’m anticipating the responses we’ll get, that’s all.”I took a deep breath.  “Okay.  Do you have any questions?  Do you need anything?”“Do you want your phone back?” she asked.I started to approach, and she tossed the phone my way.  I had to fly a bit to catch it one-handed.“We’ll let you know what we decide,” Gaymon said.I turned to walk away, and Gilpatrick told his peers, “I’ll be right back.”He walked with me, as I walked up to Sveta and Chris, put a hand on Sveta’s shoulder, and had us all walk over to where Jester was talking to Ashley.  From there, I indicated we should walk a little further away for our pow-wow.“Sorry,” Gilpatrick said.  “That is how she operates.”“She make a lot of friends with that ‘function’ of hers?”“No,” Gilpatrick said.  “I’d never pretend she has many allies or friends.  She was New York PRT, and if you ask the New York PRT, they’ll say- they would have said that they were the best in the country.“A few PRT teams would have said that,” I replied, with a sigh.  “Does she live up to her own hype?”Gilpatrick gave me a one-shouldered shrug.  “Her ass is so covered it’s bulletproof, and that’s a skill a lot of people overlook.  People who matter trust her when she talks because she is very good at explaining things to people who know nothing.  Again, a skill.”“That definitely doesn’t make friends if she wins important people over to her side when multiple others try and fail,” I said.“I won’t comment,” Gilpatrick said, in a conspiratorial way I wasn’t sure someone else would catch.  I was right.  It was something that had happened.“That’s politics.  Is she good at her job?”“Depends on what you see as her job.  I’d like to think I’m a better teacher and shaper of our youth.  She’s better at going after the bad guys.”“Worrying.”We met with Ashley, where she’d found a rock to lean against.  Jasper put the phone down beside her, then walked over to stand by Gilpatrick.  I really wondered what he’d been talking to Ashley about, and why he’d even gone to talk to her in the first place.“How’s everyone?” I asked.“Patched up,” Sveta said, patting her prosthetic shell.“Good,” Chris said.  “Did what I wanted, mostly.”I raised an eyebrow at that.  He’d seemed slightly dissatisfied earlier.  He only shrugged.“I’ve been talking to Jester and Looksee, getting caught up,” Ashley said.  “It’s a good distraction.”“Ooh, she’s into archery,” Looksee said.  The phone rested on the rock between Jasper and Ashley.  “Badass.”Ashley raised a hand, indicating the phone, “See?  Distraction enough.”“Wait,” I said.  “Say again, Looksee.  Who is into archery?”“Marcial.”“Why Marcial?”“Because she’s our biggest obstacle, and I was looking for clues.”“Looksee, you can’t spy on people,” I said.“Please,” Sveta said.“Is it really spying if the information is a mouseclick away?”“Yes,” Chris said.“Oh, hey, Creepy Kid.  Tattletale was asking about you.  I didn’t say anything, of course.”“I’m apparently Creepy Kid now,” Chris said, to Sveta and I.“I told you, you need to pick a name, or it’s going to get chosen for you,” I said.“I don’t have good ideas,” Chris said.  “The good names are taken.  The shortlist is Dramaturge, Cryptid, Cryptozoo-”Looksee snorted audibly over the phone.“Don’t laugh, Looksee,” exaggerating her name.“Looksee is good!  Victoria said you can make any name work if you do good enough, and I did good today.”“Well enough,” Chris said.“Everyone did well,” I said.  “You included, Looksee.  I know that wasn’t as close to the frontline as you want, but the camera drop, outlining the cables-”“Threads,” Looksee said.  “With force around and to them.”“Okay,” I said.  “And the fake cable coming at Cradle.  It was good.”“She was telling me about it,” Ashley said.“It was good,” I said.“If you keep saying that, she’s going to blow a fuse,” Chris said.“Oh, completely changing the subject, Capricorn is coming back with Vista.  He’s a couple of minutes away.”“I’ll go say hi in a second,” I said.“This whole thing is dizzying,” Jester said.  “I don’t know how you do it.”“In a way, I grew up with it,” I said.  “Was different, back then.  I dealt with more known quantities.  Or I thought I did.  No Marcials.  I never thought I’d miss having my mom as team leader once I flew the coop.  I considered it a good day when my aunt was the one in charge, and I still found it stifling.”“It’s not all people like Marcial,” Gilpatrick said.“I know,” I said.  I had to make a three-quarter turn to lightly punch him in the arm, because my injured arm was the one closer to him.  “We’ve got people like you and Jester.”“The fact that you’re using that name and you’re putting us in the same sentence pains me,” Gilpatrick didn’t move his lips as he murmured the words.Jester cleared his throat, looking at Gilpatrick.“I’ll give you one thing,” Chris was saying in the background, “The camera thing was a good play.  Brutal.”“Thank you, nice of you to say,” Looksee said.“It was,” Sveta said, “But I don’t like how that was worded.  Brutal and good shouldn’t be put together like that.”Chris went on, “I wanted to make a joke before, but speaking takes concentration when you don’t have the mouth you’re used to.  Now it sounds dumb, because I’d be saying it out of nowhere.”“Say it.  Say it,” Looksee said.“Looksee?  More like look out,” Chris said, and he chose the most deadpan tone of voice he could manage, in a way that sucked any of the residual humor out of the line.Looksee laughed all the same.“I hate to be a wet blanket,” Sveta said.  “But, please, almost caving in someone’s skull was an emergency measure, not a thing to be encouraged.”“Seconding that,” I said.“You seem to have your hands full,” Gilpatrick said.“Feels like it,” I said.  Even if I had perfect control of the Wretch, every hand available would be full.Ugh.  I didn’t like thinking like that.“You guys talk,” I said.  “I’m going to go see Capricorn.  He should be there soon.”“He paused to rest,” Looksee reported.  “He’s a minute away.”“Good enough,” I said.“I’ll come,” Ashley said.I hesitated.  I’d wanted to fly.  “We’ll walk fast?”She nodded.We skirted the larger meeting, where Mayday had joined the discussion with Marcial, Bash, and Gaymon.  Gilpatrick took my leaving as an excuse to go, too, but he took a separate path.Only Ashley and me.“What did you talk to Jester about?” I asked.“We didn’t talk much.  He brought the phone, and he managed it so I didn’t have to, asked how you were doing, we talked briefly about you.  He was curious about powers.  Looksee did most of the talking.”“Talking about me?”“Nothing bad,” she said.I looked back over my shoulder.  The group was still gathered.  “They’re doing better than expected.  Sveta’s quiet.”“They’re relieved that Rain is okay,” Ashley said.  “And they’re resilient.”“And you?” I asked.  “Are you okay?”“You said everyone did a good job.  I didn’t,” Ashley said.  She walked with her hand clasped around the injured portion, but the posture looked defensive.“I really liked how you handled things with Gilpatrick, turning yourself in, asking him if you could join the fight.  They’re the right moves.”“If I end up imprisoned and unable to see or call her, someone needs to look after Kenzie.”I looked at Ashley.  Her hair had dried somewhat, but it still had the wet hair look, where it webbed into thicker locks.  She was wearing the new dress- the one she’d bought in Cedar Point, but it had been melted at the side, near where her wrist dangled by her leg.  Since the capture the flag game, I’d thought of Kenzie looking after Ashley in a way, but I wasn’t so sure I’d seen Ashley looking after Kenzie.  Defending her, maybe.  Being there-“Being there for her?” I asked.“It’s part of it,” she said.  “She doesn’t have anyone.”“Doesn’t she?”“I mean someone who will be there a year from now.  The team is wobbly, none of her classmates want to be her friend, and very few people spend time with her without wanting something from her or having to be with her.  When I get in trouble for blasting Beast of Burden, make sure she has someone.  You or someone else.”I nodded.  “Her parents?”“Go to that dinner at her house or ask the others if you want an answer to that question.”I tilted my head a little, trying to see more of her face.  “Usually I can count on you for straight answers.”“Not about this.  She’d be upset with me and things are hard enough.  She’s upset with me and I’m upset with her.  The talk on the phone, with a bystander there, we were dancing around being upset with each other.”“Did I miss something?” I asked.Ashley shook her head.  She moved her injured hand, bouncing it up and down briefly, then clenched her other hand at her arm as a muffled use of her power erupted between her fingers.  Agitation.“I could have screamed at her.  It’s why I wanted this talk.”“What happened?”“I’m not sure, but she was trying to reassure me.  She said the situation was bad, there were lots of people hurt, Rain killed Snag, he was almost killed by Cradle, and even she almost killed Mama Mathers.”Ashley gave that last bit some emphasis.“You think it was intentional?  To connect, or…”“I don’t know.  She said it and I can’t get it out of my head.  If it was intentional, even if it was accidental, if she killed someone, if she ruined herself like that, for something so stupid, or because she was careless, if she’s even capable of making that kind of decision-”She was getting agitated as she talked.“I get it,” I said, interrupting the speech.  “I get it.  We’ll figure something out.  I’ll talk to her.”We walked for a short bit in silence.  I heard Ashley whisper something, but it wasn’t aimed at me.I chose to ignore the whisper, in the same way I hoped someone would ignore me communicating something to the Wretch.“She needs someone to look after her,” Ashley said.  “Now that someone can’t be me.”I looked up.  The sky was still overcast, the light of the sun fighting to shine through in a way that made it look more like the heavy clouds had faint energy glowing from within them, rather than a distant burning orb sending its light to us.“I don’t know what’s going to happen to the team,” I said.  “I think people are more shaken than they’re saying.”“They are.”“There was a lot there that was rough.  There’s still stuff out there- angry people with guns, who just saw their own get attacked, or who were forced to act by Mama Mathers.  Good people got really hurt.”“Bad people got really hurt too,” Ashley said.I paused, feeling the weight of that short statement.  “Yeah.  We’ll see how that goes.”Water pattered against my hood, and I thought the rain had started up again- it was only the wind stirring the droplets from the leaves above.I saw the distorted space before I saw Capricorn, Vista, and Chasmal.  Capricorn had one of his stone constructions over his shoulder, something that looked like a coffin, but was obviously made of Tristan’s power, with hooks and such.  Interestingly, though it looked like the sort of heavy something that would have required Tristan’s attention, it was Byron in the blue armor who was hauling it, holding up the thicker, wider upper end, with the bottom end dragging in the path behind him.Vista was shortening their path.  Chasmal would be making the coffin and the person inside light enough for Byron to drag, while simultaneously phasing Mama Mathers partially out of reality.He had a costume that sported Advance Guard’s geometric future aesthetic with a deep blue color scheme with orange trim.  The aesthetic and design seemed to be intended at invoking the dark, vigilante style.I was really hoping that a measure like that would sever her connection to others, for any point in time that she woke up.“You got her?” I asked.“Yeah.  We also pointed Mayday’s cape and the patrol crew to the building we sealed up,” Byron said.  “Hi, Damsel.”“Hi.”“She’s still unconscious or asleep in there?” I asked.“Has to be.  I’d have felt her struggling, or we would have heard her.”“She could be dead,” Damsel said.“Let’s hope,” Chasmal muttered.“I’m hoping she isn’t,” I said.  Damsel nodded her agreement with me.“I used my power to sweep over the area,” Vista said.  “I can get a general feel for when there are people somewhere and as far as I can tell, most of the town was evacuated.  We sent some people to rescue and retrieve.”“Armed, armored people,” Byron said.“But I think we did it,” Vista said.  She offered her fist out.  After a moment’s hesitation, Byron bumped it.  I was a little quicker to respond.Vista offered her fist to Ashley, and Ashley shook her head, flashing a small smile instead.Vista seemed to take it in stride.  “There were two groups that left.  One to the south-”“Handled,” I said.  “Projections stopped them, even though they knew they were projections.  They lined up to face down our defending group, and we blinded them.”“And the second one that tore through Advance Guard and the Hollow Point villains as they left by the north road.”I wished I had a better answer for her.  “We’re still figuring that one out.”“I hear Prancer’s group skedaddled?” Vista asked.“What’s left of it.  They took a few bodies with them.”“Eesh,” Byron said.“Eesh is right,” I answered him.  “They’ll go back to Hollow Point and they’ll probably find one of the Wardens’ teams waiting there.  The Shepherds or Foresight.  With luck, they’ll be so tired they won’t want to fight for the territory, or they’ll lose that fight if they pick it.”“We’re not invited?” Byron asked.I shook my head.  “We weren’t invited, we’re battered and weary, and I think I’d rather deal with the Fallen, if we were going to do something.”“Alright.  That’s almost a relief.  Come on,” Byron said.  “Let’s get this creepy woman somewhere more secure.”“Hardly a way to talk about me,” Vista said.“Ha ha,” Byron said.“We’ll take her to the patrol block leaders,” I said.  “See if that sways them any.”“I can take over dragging it if you want,” Vista said.“I’m good,” Byron said.  “I like getting to pretend I’m the one with enhanced strength.”“What did you get, if he got that?” Vista asked.“Resistance to temperature extremes,” Byron said.  He grunted as he started dragging.  “There was a time I made ice.”“Really.”“Uh huh.  There have been other things.”“Can you change back?  Is that a thing you could do if you tried, or could you change to something new?”“I could,” Byron said.  “But I don’t want to go back, and I’m worried about how I’d get somewhere new.”“I’m happy my power’s simple,” Vista said.“Gross distortion of dimensions, simple,” I said.She smiled and winked at me.She was happy, it seemed.I was- I was almost happy too.I had my concerns.  I had plenty of worries about what was going to unfold as authorities decided to go after the Fallen or to let them go, and even the simpler joy of being a heroine had been tainted by Wretch and the horribleness of the people I’d been dealing with.  I could ask how everyone was doing, keep tabs on things, and help people out, and there wasn’t anyone who was positioned or invested enough to do the same for me.A reminder to myself that I needed to call that therapist.But I could put it all aside, put it out of mind.We had Mama Mathers.  We had Operator and we had Cradle.  It was a win, and a win we’d thoroughly earned.⊙Son of a bitch, I should have known.“Why?” I asked.“We couldn’t come to a decision, so we talked to the administrators who coordinate the patrol blocks,” Captain Marcial answered me.  “They said no.”“We’re leaving the remaining Fallen?” I asked.“We explained the guns,” Gilpatrick said.  “The degree of violence here, the boundaries that were crossed.  They’ll have people on the lookout for violence, if the Fallen lash out or try something, but the sentiment expressed was that they didn’t want to punish others for getting away from a violent situation and standing down.”“They’re the Fallen,” I said.  “They don’t back down.”“They don’t back down, but they do get tired,” Marcial said.  “We have problems today, occupying heroes and patrols.  The Fallen are a problem for tomorrow.”“That’s the word from above,” Gilpatrick said.I retrieved my phone and checked the time.According to Tattletale, the Fallen would get off the road in two hours and get into the Megalopolis again, somewhere on the east coast.  They were obscuring their retreating convoy with powers, allegedly, and once they were in the city they’d connect with others.  Again, allegedly.Two hours.We’d have to deal with Tattletale to know what location, or where they were if they did get to the city.   We’d have to achieve something of a win, and we’d have to have a way to deal with the defeated Fallen.  Here, we could put them on a bus in shackles, or dedicate whole teams to managing the powered ones.  It helped that most of the powered had injuries that slowed them down.It wasn’t doable.“I’m sorry,” Gilpatrick said.  “We mitigated the damage.  We met most of the objectives, even in the face of much greater numbers than we expected.  Today was a win.”“That’s not much consolation,” Capricorn said.  He was back to being Tristan.  “We were there in the thick of it.  We saw them and talked to them.  Lives are going to be lost if we let this go.  They’re pissed.  They’re heading into a population center.”“Our resources are exhausted,” Gaymon said.  “We have limited personnel and that personnel has been tied up for the better part of the day.  If they go there and stop, we intend to let them.  Otherwise, it ends up as one prolonged engagement where both sides get tired and sloppy.”“This was already sloppy enough,” Bash said.  “Unexpected numbers, the violence.”It was so maddening, that the desire for peace and a stop to conflict would provide the flammable material needed for the fires to spread.I didn’t let that show on my face.“You’re still standing,” Capricorn said, “There’s gas in your vehicles.  These people are unreasonable, dangerous and desperate.  You can’t let this go.  Others can’t afford for you to let it go.”I wished Narwhal was around.  I wished Mayday would speak up.I shouldn’t have been surprised.  I’d had an impression of Marcial almost right away, that she wasn’t on our side.  She’d proven it.  Gilpatrick- I wanted to imagine he’d tried and failed.  In my time with the patrol block, I’d seen decisions from oversight that had definitely been this dumb.“Thank you,” I said, as diplomatically as I could.  “I understand your hands are tied, if your bosses are saying no.”Capricorn’s head snapped around.“They are,” Marcial said.  Had it come from anyone else, I might have been more inclined to believe it.Capricorn was giving me a hard look through the eyeholes of his helmet.“There’s no changing your mind,” I said, for his benefit.  “We’ll figure out what our course of action is in the next while.”“It was a good collaboration.  A good effort, even with everything that went wrong,” Gilpatrick said.  “Be safe, take care of yourselves, and let me know if you need anything.”I nodded.I left the scene behind, feeling like I might have said something regrettable if I’d stayed a moment longer.“This is where we part ways, I guess.  We’ll meet, talk,” Vista said.  “You have my number.”I nodded.  I clasped her hand in mine.“Kick some ass,” she said.“We’ll see,” I said.We were a group as we walked away.  Me, Capricorn, Sveta, Chris, Ashley, and Looksee had joined us, coming from New Haven to our powwow.One more member to get.We filed into the bus.  Rain was awake, a phone that wasn’t his in his lap.“Cradle?” he asked.“In custody,” I said.  “Which is something we need to talk about, because it’s you that makes the final call.”                                                                                        Pitch – 6.8                                                                                        “Snuff?” Tattletale asked.  She glanced back at the hooded brute.  “Can you take Chicken Little for a walk?”“Can do,” the man in the hood said.“Chicken Little?” I asked.“That’s a good name,” Looksee said.  “The sky is falling, the sky is falling!”I could hear Chris sigh.“I make it fall,” the boy with the birds said.  His voice was small and far away.  On a rooftop to our left, birds took off, flying through the light rain.“Perfect,” Looksee said, giving him a thumbs up.Chris sighed again.The birds swooped down to settle at the foot of one of the blocky, concrete office buildings.“Bye,” Chicken Little said.“Bye,” Looksee said.The birds took off, flying over and ahead of the kid.The fact that everyone was waiting for the hooded executioner to lead the kid villain away gave me a chance to observe and think- he wasn’t good at projecting his voice.  His frame was more similar to Kenzie, but he slouched some like Chris did.  Chris, though, had a natural volume, possibly because of subtle changer effects.  I felt an urge to coach him, and correct something that seemed so obvious, which might have been why I was fixated on it.It was disconcerting to picture my giving him some tips, having him standing up straighter, having him put his hands in his back pockets as an example of how far back his shoulders should be, and having him speak.  My mom had done it with me, once upon a time.Rain pattered down beyond the lip of shelter that extended out over our portion of the plaza.  The sound of pained breathing wheezed in and out in the background.“Chicken Little,” I said, again.“I was pushing for Hitchcock,” Tattletale said.  “Cardinal was good too, but taken.”“I was pushing for Unkindness,” Imp added.  “It went over everyone’s heads.”“Then it’s not a good cape name,” I said.  “It’s going over my head.”“High bar,” Imp retorted.“I was a pretty good student, actually,” I said.“Were you, though?  I was a terrible student and I got it.”“An unkindness of ravens,” Ashley said.  Her voice came from Looksee’s camera, rather than from the projection.“Thank you!” Imp said.“It’s not very good,” Ashley said.“Ugh!”“He controls a swarm of birds?” I asked.  I arched an eyebrow.“It reminded me of a friend, believe it or not.  He needed a mentor, and it seemed natural.”“Naturally,” I said.“Trying to do right by him,” Tattletale said, “Letting him pick his own name, which you should never let a pre-teen do-”“Ahem,” Looksee said.“Damn straight,” Chris said.“-Teaching him what he needs to know to get by as a cape in this crazy world of ours, and, you know, not making him stand there while you parade around a projection of a horribly maimed teenager.  The little things.”“I’m his age and I put that projection together, you know,” Looksee said.  “I had to look really closely at the images I was rendering.  This is good work!”“You appear to have mentors who are fine with exposing you to that kind of thing, Looksee,” Tattletale’s reply was as smooth as anything.“Maybe I’m a badass,” Looksee said.  “I took out Mama Mathers.”“Speaking of,” Tattletale said, perking up and looking past Looksee to Capricorn.  “She’s dead?  No.  Contained?”“She’s contained with physical constraints and some power stuff,” Capricorn said.“Partially phased into another reality,” Rain clarified.  “I talked to the heroes.  She’s kept an eye on the Crowley clan for years, twenty-four seven.  She might not sleep.”“Tranquilizers don’t work, she’ll fake it,” Tattletale said.  “You figured that out.  Good.  Phasing her out should break the connection as long as it lasts, if it can be maintained.  It might even force her to reset all the connections.”“That was the line of thinking,” I said.Rain spoke up, taking advantage of the fact he’d had an opening in the conversation again, “I’d really like to hear how you can know how she works, know how she keeps people under her thumb, and then sign off on hurting the innocents caught in the mix.  Doing this to me.”“I’d like to hear that too, Tattletale,” Foil said.“Please,” Parian said.“Please,” I said, echoing Parian’s word, but in my brightest, nicest tone of voice.  I smiled at Tattletale.Tattletale fixed me with her best ‘are you serious’ look.“You said you’d help Cradle, but you didn’t want to know what happened to the kid,” I said.  “We thought you needed to see the consequences of your actions.”“That is pretty ripe, coming from the princess of damage and her troupe of walking disaster areas,” Tattletale said.  “I have looked you guys up, read files, you know.”“Deflecting?” Tristan asked.“A bit, yeah.  But I think it’s important for context, because you guys don’t get to act high and mighty here.  The Fallen kid locked people inside a mall and let them die from trampling, fire and smoke.  The junior half of Team Reach crashed and burned after you got up to your antics, Capricorn.  Damsel of Distress had an invite to the Slaughterhouse Nine.”“So did I,” Rachel said.“Shh,” Tattletale said.“Are you saying you’d do the same for any of us?” I asked.“I’m saying you guys are really not the ones who should be throwing stones here.  I know how you got together, even if I don’t have all the individual details.  The institution that looks after Creepy Kid barely sees him and they’re scared enough of him when he’s there to let him do what he wants.  There’s a story there.”Something to look into, then.Tattletale went on, “Garotte, honey, you had my team’s back at the Cauldron HQ.  I don’t want to sling mud at you, but anyone who knows you knows you’re dangerous and you’ve hurt a lot of people.”“Anyone who knows her wouldn’t fault her for it,” I said.  “I can fault you for knowing full well what you were setting in motion.”Sveta spoke, “I have never, not once, wanted anyone to die,” Sveta said, her voice firm, even tight.“You and I both know that’s a lie,” Tattletale said.“Death happened,” Sveta said.  She was glowering.  “If I’d had the choice, I would have spared even her.  My body was wounded, I was as freaked out as I’ve ever been, and someone needed to die.  I’ve made peace with the fact that I was able to make that someone be her.”“Convenient,” Tattletale’s word was barely audible.“Honey,” Sveta replied, and the word was only venom.  “Don’t say you don’t want to sling mud at me and then go for the jugular.  We’re not stupid.  If you’re going to be vicious with someone who has saved the lives of several people here, don’t coat it in that ‘honey’.”“Throwing everything you’ve got at the wall and seeing what sticks, Tattletale?” I asked.  “Desperate.”“I’m tired,” Tattletale said.“You skipped me, by the way,” Looksee said.“I skipped you because you’re prepubescent and I’m not that big of a bitch.”“I can take it.  I don’t want special treatment.”“I’m tired, Victoria,” Tattletale said.  “I’ve spent two years trying to do my part to keep the world standing upright.  Parian, Foil, Imp, Rachel, you guys know the kind of thing I’ve been doing.”“Ignoring me is bitchier than whatever you were going to say,” Looksee said.“What if I told you there was nothing?” Tattletale asked, exasperated.“I’d say you were being condescending, which is super bitchy.”“Kiddo, you fucking raised the bar by not only blazing an accelerant-soaked trail of destruction through your cape life, but your civilian life too.  You did more damage casually than some do intentionally.  There’s a reason I ignored your calls.  You proved me right when you bricked my good phone with the incessant attempts to get my attention.”“Can confirm,” Imp remarked.  “Tats went mute mid-mission while she scrambled to get a new phone.  She was pissed.  It was great.”Looksee paused, digesting that, then answered Tattletale at a lower volume than before. “I automated it, so you know.”“I figured.  Point stands.”“It’ll unbrick if you reply to one of the messages.  That was the point, if you read any of the warnings or the last message sent.”Tattletale shook her head.  “Where was I?”“You’re tired, so you took a shortcut by striking a deal with a guy who was really good with blades and the guy who really wanted me cut up,” Rain said.I glanced at the Undersiders.  They weren’t moving much.  Foil was bending down so Parian could whisper something in her ear.  Both of them were fixing their eyes on Tattletale, even while Parian whispered.“Not a shortcut,” Tattletale said.“He knew where to place the blades for maximum effect, drawing it out,” Rain said.  His fingers touched one of the wounds.  “That’s why they hired him, you know.”“It wasn’t a shortcut, and it was never intended that they’d go through with it,” Tattletale said.  “So please, off the high horses, stop crawling up my ass, and I’ll explain.”“That you made a mistake,” I said.“Oh my god,” she said.  “If they didn’t hire me, they would have hired someone else.  The benefit of them hiring me?  I had every intention of steering them away.  I offered Cradle something he wanted more than revenge, last minute, after I’d proven I could deliver what he wanted.  Well, it wasn’t last minute.  Last thirty seconds, because I had to take thirty to put my card in a new phone to repopen communication after someone bricked my good phone.”Tattletale frowned at Looksee as she said that last part.“A mistake, then,” I said.  “You were tired and you made a mistake, is what you’re saying.”“Someone else got to Cradle in the meantime, I think.  If we had this conversation in five days, I could give you a definitive answer.  For now, best I can do for explanations?  I figured it out and someone steered him onto a more determined course.  I didn’t make a mistake, and no, grab bags aren’t some inexplicable thing for me.  I wasn’t shooting blind, thank you very much.”“Are you saying that because you’re for real or because you’re trying to cover your weaknesses?”“Gee, Victoria,” Tattletale said.  “I could hardly be blamed if it was me covering my ass.  The last time I gave you a hint about the strengths and weaknesses of my power, you went full offensive with this bit of theatrics.  But no.  March was and is an isolated, special case.”“In so many ways,” Foil murmured.“Theatrics are one of the best part of being a cape,” I said.“One of them,” Capricorn said.“Okay,” she said.  “But you’re wrong that I’m covering my ass.  No, sorry.”I was right that Rain had her agitated though.“What was the plan?” Rain asked.“Had all gone as intended, you would have walked away.  A lot depended on whether your three fellow grab-bags were there together, or which one or two were there, but there was no way I could make the offer earlier.”“Why not?” I asked.“How do you think that would go, Victoria?  Hey, guys, I’ll give you this thing if you promise not to go after this member of the Fallen you have really good justification for hating.  For no reason, I promise, I’m totally not on his side.  Come on.  They do have some humanity.  For Snag, a few choice words at the moment he was about to pull the metaphorical trigger, as that tiny part of him screamed that it didn’t want to do it?  Would’ve worked.”“Love Lost?” Rain asked.“Angrier.  Hurting more.  You would have needed to bleed first, but it wouldn’t have been nearly as bad.  It’s why I told Cradle that if he and Operator went after you, she shouldn’t be there.  She would have been too hard to hold back, and what I told him was that she would have snapped and killed you in a very unsatisfyingly quick way.  I could have steered her away with the right words, right timing, but I didn’t want to gamble it.  Cradle is pragmatic.  He got it.  She wasn’t invited along.”“And Cradle?  He was there and you couldn’t stop him.”“Like I said, I needed to prove I could deliver, to maintain the professional relationship, but I didn’t have to deliver if I could make a better offer.  I think someone beat me to it, offering him something.”“Who?  What were they offering?  What were you?”“I don’t know who or what.  They exist in hypothetical.  As for me, I was offering a way out.”“A way out,” Rain said.  “Of the- the rotation.”“There’s a cape by the name of Goddess.  Also the Blue Empress, Blue Lady, the Woman in Blue.  Once situated on Earth Shin, she was brought here for the fight against Scion by a strange, unnamed player who has since been classified as a threat on par with any Endbringer.  Or with Goddess, as it happens.  Unfortunately, this anonymous figure didn’t put her back.”“A strange, unnamed player?” I asked.“So it happens,” Tattletale said, with a grin.  “With only a select group of top Wardens and major players really tracking what really happened.  But we were talking the woman in blue.  She got powers and was relocated to Earth Shin before she could… grow to full potential.  Relocated by a certain secretive agency.”“Cauldron,” Sveta said.“Yep.  She proceeded to take over earth Shin, with all other parahumans acting as her lieutenants.  All other parahumans on that world, mind.  No exceptions.  Which the organization deemed fine, because they got to keep her in their back pocket, even while they couldn’t control her.  She is, or was, a grab-bag, she found a way to pull free of her cluster, and she came out of it with a set of powers that would each be world-class on their own.”“What happened to the others?” Rain asked.“Dead?” I guessed.“Alive.  Four of them, anyhow.  A fifth killed themselves because they couldn’t fill the void where the power and feeling powerful once were.  None of them were left with more than whispers of power after.  But they had their lives and their particular dynamic was stopped in its tracks.  Not all clusters have a schtick, but they did, like the mall group does, and Goddess taking all the power brought an end to it.”“You were going to tell Cradle how to do it,” Rain said.  “How to get all the power and leave the rest of us with nothing.”“Can you fault me?  He’s the most level headed, and out of the rest of the group, one was an raging asshole, my second choice of the bunch by the way, one can’t take her mask off because if she does she can’t help but scream, and the last member of the group kept the door locked while a mall full of people were trampled, burned, and-or suffocated.”“He would have gotten all the power for himself?” I asked.“The last time this worked, the parahuman was way more than the sum of the individual parts.  I’ve tried to sell Foil on it, but she isn’t too keen.”“I don’t want to tamper,” Foil said.“I don’t either,” Parian said.“She’s happy, see?  Cradle, though?  He was one hundred percent the type to go for it, all signs pointed to yes, and he said no.”“Because he’s a cluster cape,” Chris said.  “You had a bad read.”Prodding her.“No.  Because then I would have had a capital-N-slash-capital-A, underlined, for my thinker read on him.”Prodding her and it worked.“There’s an issue with this,” Capricorn said.“A few, actually,” Sveta said.“The one that springs to mind is that you wanted to repeat the process that, the last time it worked, saw a whole Earth being taken over?” Capricorn asked.“He would have owed me one,” Tattletale said.  “I don’t think he would have been as strong.  Four powersets baseline.”“I think the last thing the world needs is more over-the-top parahumans,” I said.“I think you’re situated on in your own little peninsula,  with your own little team, while I’m the one who has spent the last two years trying to help the peace stay peaceful.  Like I said, there are a lot of people trying to keep things upright, but they aren’t communicating, they can’t, and the guys on the far side of everything are pushing really frigging hard to keep things from toppling, and something’s going to give.  Over here?  We can’t push back.  We don’t have muscle.”“That’s why you want Cradle?” Rain asked.  “To be your muscle?”“No.  That’s my last ditch move, believe me.  For now, there’s another player who’s pushing on things.  Someone we tried really frigging hard to kick down an metaphorical elevator shaft, as it happens.”“Ha,” Imp said.  “That asshole.”“We broke his legs and we scared him away, and he’s good at hiding.  He likes tinkers and he’s interested in complex powers.  If I could have a tinker I can trust with the right emotion power for the task at hand?”“Cradle,” Capricorn said.“I’d need to have a conversation with him.  A long one, so I can figure out what went wrong back there.  If he wasn’t too compromised and my idea of giving him all the powers was tempting for him, he’d go run this errand for me, spend about a year in a completely different Earth with no access to your Fallen boy there.  I’d figure out what to do with him by the conclusion of it.”“If he was compromised?” Ashley asked.“Cross that bridge when I come to it,” Tattletale said.Ashley made a gun with the fingers and thumb of her good hand.  A glitch manifested at a fingertip as she ‘fired’ it.  The projected image flickered violently, presumably where her power was kicking in, the effect tracing around her hand as she lowered it, joined by a plume of more artifacting and glitches at the damaged spot of her arm.  The sound was muted, and the camera whined.  A dog barked.“My dogs don’t like that sound,” Rachel said.  “Stop.”Looksee thumped the camera.“Assuming you’re suggesting I kill him, it’s not out of the question,” Tattletale said.  “I’m not as shy as you lot pretend to be.  I can’t push that hard on things as a whole.  I don’t have the muscle some of the major players do, and that’s just reality.  I can try to open channels and hamstring the ones who aren’t helping.  I need Cradle.  Give me him, I can help you guys with the Fallen.”We exchanged glances.“I’m not happy you were keeping this secret,” Foil said.“I’ve offered to rope you guys in.  You’re making and distributing clothes and doing your mercenary thing,” Tattletale said.  “If you only join for the big stuff, it gets hard to get you up to speed, especially if I don’t want to tip off someone like Cradle.  If you insist this is my thing and that you want no part in it, don’t get so upset if I do it in a very Tattletale way.”“She’s lonely,” Imp said.“I’m irritated,” Tattletale said.  “I’m tired.  We’ve got the lady in blue trying to get up to full strength again, a guy who wears fucking sweaters is pulling at the threads that are holding everything together while maintaining and expanding the institution side of the old Cauldron.  A handful of others are running the ideological end of Cauldron.  Both of those groups are strong in their own way and yet they aren’t doing a tenth what Cauldron used to do in forestalling disasters and containing the most… unproductive capes and cape-related messes.”“They’re rebuilding Cauldron?” Sveta asked, horrified.“The day the Cauldron cracked, they were there moving in with what would be hundreds of employees.  You were there at one point.  You had to have seen the empty offices and rooms.  Every last one of those offices have people now.  Are they doing things on the level of what they did to you guys?  No.  But only because they lack the opportunity.”“Oh my god,” Sveta said.“And again, there used to be an awful lot of really fucked up parahumans, powers and power-related things that would have top tier capes moving in to relocate or destroy, before those things were even a problem.  Those guys aren’t doing that clean-up anymore!  I’ve taken some of that on my plate, in the course of my regular business.  There’s a war starting sometime this week, a Machine Army that’s literally on the horizon if you can see between worlds, warlords, broken triggers, and yeah, the Fallen are a mess unto themselves.”“They have reach,” I said.  “They’re hooking people in.”“I know they’re a thing.  They’re a relatively manageable thing.  Let’s not forget that, you know, if every single last one of these manageable and less manageable problems I’ve mentioned were magically handled, this city would not be in an especially good place.  Okay?  That’s what I’m doing.  Could I have handled this particular thing better?  Probably.  But I’m not the bad guy.”“Sounds major,” I said.Tattletale shrugged.  She shifted position where she sat on the table, crossing her legs.  She grabbed her ankles with her hands.“Thank you for doing what you’ve been doing,” I said.“It’s nice to get that from someone,” she said.“But I can’t help but notice that through all of this, explaining yourself, you haven’t actually apologized for your part in it.”Rain was very still, to the point that I wasn’t sure if he’d glitched out and frozen again, with the camera needing more percussive maintenance.But his hair moved.  The breathing continued.Tattletale replied, “Whatever I say, you find fault in it.  Forget words.  Look at my actions here.”Capricorn answered her.  “Your action is that you’re giving us help, but it’s help in exchange for this person you need, someone you’ve shown you can’t keep on top of.  That person wants my friend dead.  If the tables were turned, would you consider that gracious?”“Tattletale,” Sveta said, adding her voice to his.  “You have to know those Fallen are going to hurt people.  You can’t want that.  When everything went to shit and the world ended, there was an implicit trust.  Can we take a step back toward that?  Give us this.  Then we’ll talk, we’ll bring others into the discussion.”“Spies and moles.  Some with thinker or changer powers,” Tattletale said.  “Have to limit who we bring into the discussion.  Look at what happened back outside New Haven.  I’m deeming you guys, like, sixty percent safe, which I normally wouldn’t work with, but if I don’t deal with you then I might lose these guys.”She jerked her thumb at the Undersiders.“If you think you’re getting rid of me for good, you’re deluded,” Imp said.  “Though I have to say I was pretty disappointed at the start there.”“Have I redeemed myself in your eyes?” Tattletale asked, sarcastic.“You’re okayish,” Imp said.“I’m so glad.”Tattletale answered Imp, but I could see that her attention was on Foil and Parian.Rachel could apparently be assumed to be fine with things.I could see the pair mulling things over.  As they whispered, Tattletale’s focus still pointed in their direction, it became harder to say that she wasn’t waiting for a verdict from them.“Can we trust her?” Capricorn asked.  He’d drawn closer to me, and now spoke in my ear.  Sveta was already situated near enough to me to hear the question.I couldn’t give an immediate answer.Looksee approached us.  She brought the camera, which struggled to keep the projections stable as it bobbed, but it seemed to serve to allow Rain and Ashley to join our conversation.  Chris was the last to catch up with us.“I trust her,” Looksee said.  “I asked her to dish dirt on me and she did.”“That’s the worst way of telling,” Chris said.“Being treated crummy is way better than being ignored,” Looksee said.“That’s not right,” Ashley said.  “Don’t ever let someone who should care about you treat you badly.”“Yeah?  Okay.  Then don’t talk to me right now.  I’m mad at you.  I’m mad at mostly everyone but especially you.”“Especially me?”“Especially you.”“Fair.”“Everyone’s input is important here,” Capricorn said.  “But Rain, you were the one who was hurt.  Victoria, you know Tattletale best out of all of us.”“We need to help those people,” Sveta said.“I know,” Capricorn said.  “But I think if Rain feels conflicted about releasing Cradle, even with this new information-”“Which may or may not be true,” Chris interrupted.“It’s understandable, isn’t it?” Capricorn asked.“Conflicted is understandable,” Sveta said.  “I had to face down the person who changed me in a life-altering way.  I know you’re connected to them.  You can’t get away from them.  I see it’s similar in a way and I understand.  I really do.”“It’s a question of what you’d regret, I think,” I said.“Meaning you think Rain should release Cradle to buy Tattletale’s help,” Chris said.“I don’t think that at all,” I said.  “I think… you can help the most people possible, and you can still end up with horrible regrets and serious consequences.”“She got to you.”It took me a second to connect to who had spoken.  Sveta.She was partially focused on Tattletale.  Imp, Rachel, Parian and Foil were talking in an animated way, with some henchmen on the very periphery.  Tattletale hadn’t budged from her seat, her attention focused on nothing in particular.“Tattletale,” I finished the thought.  “Maybe she did.”“You trust her?” Capricorn asked, again.“No,” I said.  “But I think I believe her.”“Fuck,” Rain said.All heads turned to face his projection, except Looksee, who looked at the camera instead.“If it comes down to regretting deaths five years from now or saving lives and maybe not living through the next five years, I guess I’ll save the lives,” Rain said.“You’re sure?” Capricorn asked.“No.  But I spent my whole life as a believer.  I’ll believe this is the right thing.”“Come on,” Capricorn said.As a group, we walked over to the Undersiders’ huddle.  Tattletale rotated herself on her seat atop the concrete slab table with a push of her hand, to stay facing us.The Undersiders broke away from their cluster to face us as we drew nearer.  One of the dogs growled, and Rachel shushed it.“Tattletale,” Parian said.  “We think you should make amends here.”Tattletale’s eyes roved over our group.  She fixed them on Rain.She knew.  She knew what we came to say.  That Rain had come to the conclusion he had.“Amends,” she said.  “I’ll point you at the Fallen.  You don’t have to give me Cradle.  If I really need him, I’ll discuss it with you and get permission first.”⊙Boston.  New Boston, but all attempts to make that stick had failed, in a stark contrast to how Brockton Bay had been so ready to rechristen itself as New Brockton.Boston wasn’t a city, really.  It was more of an Über-neighborhood, one set of tiles in the vast, disappearing-into-the-horizon expanse of city that was the megalopolis.  It wasn’t really Boston, either.  Attempts had been made to make Boston resemble its former self, but materials were different, everything was new, and the golden patina remained.Fenway Station.  A transportation hub, surrounded by quickly thrown-together homes that attempted to stay hidden or camouflaged among the brownstone and brick fixtures with gold-tinted windows.The Boston neighorhoods had heroes of their own.  Independents, and small teams separate from the Wardens.  With Tattletale making the calls, we had their help.  There were others, but Tattletale felt they were a risk, with a chance of moles and troublemakers, and I believed her.Everyone was finding a location.  Looksee had one working camera doing sweeps, and the laptop beside her showed the figures.  Some were highlighted in red.  Strange body shapes, statures, or more muscle than the usual.  When they clustered, we could know that the people on one floor or one set of floors of a building were likely capes.People from the Clans were out on the street.  Not many bikers.  There would be Fallen too.I sat on the edge of a roof, and Looksee sat with her back to the lip of the roof beside me, her laptop placed where the both of us could see it.  Sveta sat beside me, and shifted position to rest her head on my shoulder.  Like old times.“Capricorn?” Looksee asked.A pause.“Red pickup, rust at left wheel.  A bit ahead of you.  It has guns in the back,” she said.Another pause.“Sounds good,” she said.“How’re you managing your end of things?” Sveta asked.“It’s pretty easy,” Looksee said, without turning around.  “Facial recognition, tagging everyone that’s a possible problem.”The cooperation of everyone we needed to cooperate.  We had a secured perimeter, there were civilians inside that perimeter, but if we timed our attack just right, then there was a good chance we could evacuate them out.  Sveta and I were in the wings.  Capricorn could bar the path to bystanders.The team was missing Rain, who was still recuperating.  Ashley was waiting for proper transportation to a secure facility.This was, in a way, a microcosm of the conflict we’d just weathered.  We were tired, hurting, and pushing forward purely on the energy that came from this being something we really wanted to do.Sveta, Kenzie, Tristan, Byron, myself.  We wanted to be heroes.  I liked to think we were heroes.Chris- he was out there, at one of the distant corners of the perimeter, being Chris and keeping an eye on things.  He’d told us that he could change twice a day, but he’d also implied it wouldn’t be a problem if trouble headed his way, that he’d be okay.Hard to tell, sometimes, when parahumans could be so foolhardy.Chris wanted- not to be a hero.  He seemed to want something out of being a hero.Rain and Ashley- I was pretty sure they needed to be heroes, but it wasn’t a need in the same way I needed to be a hero or I wasn’t living up to some fundamental part of myself.  They needed to be heroes in the sense that someone who was freezing to death needed to start fires.Rain had taken a giant step forward in that regard, and Ashley had fallen back.I knew what I needed to do.  I’d keep tabs on them.  I’d go to dinner with Kenzie and ensure that she knew that if the team did in fact fall apart, it didn’t mean the relationships were gone.  I’d check on Chris’ situation, because what Tattletale had said concerned me.  I’d follow up on Tristan.  I’d continue to visit Sveta at her place, and see Weld.  I would check in on on Ashley and Rain, whatever path they had ahead of them.  If that meant making sure they had visitors in jail, then I’d handle that.“They want the go-ahead to attack,” Looksee said.I had a bird’s eye view of everything.  I surveyed the situation, checked the laptop.“They want it soon.  People are getting into cars in the parking garage.  Some of those cars have guns.”I gave her a thumbs up.“Attacking,” she reported.Cars pulled out of the parking garage.  They skidded through puddles, and the puddles solidified.  The first truck lost the rubber from three of its wheels, skidding forward on the rims and one corner of the front end.  The one behind it stopped abruptly, with the vehicles behind it crashing into it, in a three-car pileup.I saw the colors as capes descended on the scene.  As more left the bottom floor of the building on foot, and yet others climbed out by way of the fire escape, it quickly became an all-out brawl.It was weird to be removed from it, to not be leaping in.  I was reminded of how I’d felt when I’d been on the patrol block.  I’d handled the research, tutored the kids, gave presentations on key things about parahumans, and I’d handled the routine errands like taking water out to tent cities and out past the portals.A part of me had wanted to leap into things, and that part of me had stopped because it had known that leaping in had meant using the wretch, and I hadn’t been ready to do that.I’d gone from stark nightmare to vague, new reality and I’d struggled hard in the transition.  I’d thought I was getting better, settling for the vague reality, no longer fighting it.  Staying still and going easy had meant letting myself heal, hadn’t it?Then the attack on the community center.  The reality check.  Then finding out that this world didn’t really have a place in it for me, if I really wanted to be me.Then the therapy team.Even that had felt indistinct somehow.  When I’d introduced the topic of being heroes, hadn’t I talked about the kinds of hero?  The ways money came in- we’d started to do that, but indistinctly.  Heroes were ideological, or they were about money.  They could be heroes for a cause or specific mission.Indistinct because we’d been a mix of heroes at heart, heroes to serve ends, and those who needed to be heroes, but who, at the time, weren’t.Looksee was struggling with saying goodbye to people.  I was telling myself I could keep the people, but I struggled with saying goodbye to the idea.“Fire,” Sveta said.The jackasses were spreading out, and I saw the orange tint of flame, the black of smoke.  They were setting fire to the trash that had been set out, to a dumpster, and to the contents of one ruined truck bed.I heard Capricorn’s voice through my earphone, even though the earphone wasn’t plugged into my ear.“He says he’s got it.”I adjusted my earbud to bring the attached microphone closer to my mouth.  “Careful of any explosives in the truck bed.”“Got it,” I heard his reply.“Group leaving the corner of the building,” Looksee said.  “It might be major capes, using the big fight for a distraction.”Sveta lifted her head from my shoulder.“Who’s on it?” I asked.“Nobody.  There’s a perimeter that should catch them, they’ll get there in a few minutes.”“And nobody stopping them from hurting anyone on the way?” Sveta asked.“No, I guess not.”I lifted off, floating away from the edge of the roof.“Keep the camera close,” I said, putting my earphone in, before adjusting the flap at the base of my hood to hide the cord.  “We delay them until others come.  Looksee?  Point those others our way.”“On it.”Best to include her.  Things breaking apart would hit her hardest.  It was just so hard to do without actually having her in the field.Sveta grabbed something and hurled herself off the rooftop.I could see the bright colors, as I drew closer.  The exposed skin of arms sticking out of sleeveless shirts was heavily and brightly tattooed.Jackasses, maybe.  It was almost motley.  I saw two of them ran with their hands tucked in their jackets.  Holding something out of sight.And among them, someone who wasn’t a twenty-something in bright color.  A guy, long-limbed with long bleached hair with dark roots and a goatee, jogging and moving with languid ease that belied something else at play.  He wore black.Sveta grabbed onto the light pole near me and pulled herself to it.  I floated next to her.“Grab the tall one?” I asked.  “If there’s trouble from others, I deflect.  If it’s trouble from him, I hit him hard enough he stops doing it.”She nodded.Her hand grabbed at the guy’s arm as I got to the group.  I went straight for the jackass with his hand in his jacket, knocking him into the ground with enough force that if he wasn’t unconscious, he was broken enough to not be a threat.The other one whipped out a gun.  His eyes widened as he saw me flying, and then he turned, pointing the gun down the street.  There were people.  Distant, but people.I caught his arm and shoved it down as he pulled the trigger.  I leveraged the wretch, used the strength, and snapped the bones of his arm.The tall guy- Sveta had grabbed him, but now the other four jackasses were splitting into ghostly images- each was distorted, and each pulled away from the source jackass with an acrobatic leap or flip.  They were massing on Sveta’s arm and glove, weighing it down.She pulled and she drew the guy in, but it was slow and sluggish.Instead, I grabbed the guy from behind, hauling him backward.  She let go of him, and with her hand free of that grip, it began to pull and slip back through the group.The duplicates.  This was one of the Crowley leaders.His eyes were wide and showing too much white as he turned my way.His own faded duplicates swarmed me, hands and faces and the press of the physical.  They came at me hard and fast, like they were propelled away from him by some motive force.  When they made contact, they weren’t strong.But I felt myself losing even though the strength wasn’t all that.Where they overlapped.I met them with the Wretch, pushing them off and away with some violence.  I struck at the overlapping portions, where one swing could hit multiple.He’d broken free of my grip in the midst of the storm he had created.  Now he backed away.  He moved his hands, and all around me, mailboxes, light posts, trash and individual pieces of a nearby car broke away, becoming a storm of shadowy projectiles.Were it one projectile, I could have dodged.  Were it a handful of meaningful ones, it would have been easier.  As it was, it was a hundred inconsequential projectiles, and where they converged or overlapped, they were solid or more solid.I was forced to fly at an odd course, up, back and away, so I wouldn’t fly into any of the incoming images.  The stream changed course, everything flying toward my new location.  I moved from point to point, to make getting a bead on me as hard as possible.And between me and him, it was a veritable wall of flying images, concrete and glass peeling away from the sidewalk and nearby windows like paper from a stack that never ended.  Only these papers crashed and shattered on impact.“You think you’ve won,” the Crowley leader said.Sveta was free of the jackasses, as she clung to the wall.  She’d grabbed a gun from their midst and held it on one hand.  She seemed to have found herself in a bind in the process.  The gun couldn’t be dropped without delivering it to the same people she’d taken it from, couldn’t be thrown away because it was a gun, and she didn’t have the dexterity to put it in a pocket where it might stay for good.  At the same time, while her hand held the weapon, she was limited in mobility.I put my hands out.She launched the gun.“You haven’t won,” the Crowley brother said.I smacked the gun with the Wretch hard enough to shatter it.“We haven’t lost,” I said.  “The Fallen aren’t going to have a lot going for them when most of you are in custody.  Today was a pretty bad day for assholes.”“You think we’re broken, bitch?”Sveta reached out, seizing him by the neck.He created shadow-selves, and they pulled away from his body in a way that broke her grip.  The initial momentum still yanked him back and off his feet.  He climbed to a standing position, shadow-selves appearing in crouching positions, forming people for him to lean on as he climbed up to his feet.I’d known Eric to do the same kind of thing.  Crystal’s brother had been good with forcefields.This guy was more of a forcefield creator than a duplicator, if I thought about it.  The forcefields were just very detailed simulacra of whatever he was spawning them from, and there was utility in how they emerged and flew out.It was easier to fly and flow between them.  Thinking about it all like that, I could fight him.  A shift in mindset.He still concentrated a lot of them near him.  That was the barrier.I could also wait for the reinforcements.I wouldn’t.  I’d take him with one hand.“The fire’s handled, but they have friends in the neighborhood,” Capricorn said, over comms.“Noted,” I murmured.The jackasses were spreading out.  Several made a run for it.  Sveta snatched at them, holding and pulling long enough to break their stride and keep them from getting way.The Crowley brother saw, and he smirked, showing teeth so white they had to be fake.“If this comes down to a fight, you’re leaving on a stretcher,” I said.  “I’m all out of patience.”“Can you fight?” he asked.I hit the ground hard enough to crack it.  I’d pay the neighborhood back for that.  But the impact was enough to upset his footing, and as his frame of reference changed, so did the angle and flow of the phantom images.   He tipped back, and there was a clearance of a few feet off the ground in front of him where the images weren’t.I dove, flying, and slid through that clearance.  It was a maneuver that put me within a few feet of him.  I reached out, striking with my good arm, and I felt the impact.  No strength, but a smash to the nose.A phantom’s nose.  He’d projected one out from his face as I’d swung.I followed up, hitting, kicking, and then doing the same thing but with the wretch, for the extra force and the ability to tear right past them.  I could see him press back, until his jackasses were right behind him.  Sveta yanked on the jackasses, hauling them away, and the Crowley brother tipped backward onto his back.“Stretcher or surrender?” I asked, amping up the aura in a subtle way.  Too big of a push could scare, but it also was a thing.  Something people could push back against.I could use it here to play it subtle, drive the moment home.“Fine then,” he said.  He smiled, and he dismissed the images.  The transparent detritus, trash, objects and figures faded out.I remained tense.  What was the catch?“Bro,” one Jackass said.“We’ll surrender if you give us a seat to enjoy the show,” he said.I didn’t respond, only glancing at Sveta.She was as lost as I was.“I’m not that faithful a man, that’s not a secret,” he said, still smiling with those too-white teeth amid the wiry goatee.  “But I do believe this is going to be a hell of a thing, tonight.”                                                                                        Pitch – 6.9                                                                                        “Looksee,” I said.  “Are you there?”“Always,” came the reply.“I have someone with me that I’m pretty sure is one of the Crowley brothers,” I said.  I noted the slight nod, and the almost satisfied expression from the man.  It wasn’t him faking me out, I was pretty sure.  Instead, he seemed to like the recognition, even to the point that he was willing to give up information to bask in it.  “He says something bad is up.”“Capricorn and Sveta are dealing with people with guns.  That’s bad.”“Something big,” I said.“I’ll call everyone.”“Please.  Start with authorities.  Wardens.  Then the team.”The Crowley brother still had his hands up in surrender.  It didn’t really mean a lot, a lot of the time.  There was no position or way of being that would make a parahuman a non-threat.This was where we needed the help of the patrol.  I had one Crowley and a bunch of Jackasses that had surrendered, they apparently had guns, and… what?  I had nowhere to take them, I couldn’t drag the leader off without the others causing trouble or hurting someone, and I couldn’t easily cuff them with one hand.I was forced to wait if I didn’t want to let them go.“Writing a text message to send to Wardens since their phone lines are garbage awful.  I’ll have Capricorn on the line.  The connection died when he switched.  One sec.”I could hear the background noise over Capricorn’s voice.  Byron’s voice, against a backdrop of shouting.  “Victoria?”“Something big’s happening.  I caught one of the leaders and he’s smug,” I said.The Crowley brother smiled.“Bait?” Chris asked.  “What’s the context?”Sveta approached, standing beside me where she could keep an eye on some of the Jackasses.“I threatened to break his arms and legs.  He surrendered, arms up, and said he’ll cooperate if he gets to see the show.”“If you threaten to break someone’s arms and legs, I’m pretty sure they’ll say anything,” Chris said.“I like how you say that like you have experience on the subject,” Looksee said.“I’ve met some shitty people over the years.  You can learn a lot from shitty people.”“Focus, please,” Byron said.  The shouting was louder.  “One-”“He cut out,” Looksee reported.  “He changed and the connection didn’t translate.  I thought I jiggered it right but this is really not my area of expertise.  I think it’s because of my phone box…”She went on, saying more, tinker talk.  While she talked, one of the Jackasses turned to his boss.  “We don’t have to put up with this, Vince.”“It’s fine.  Stay put,” Vince Crowley said.Middle brother.  It made sense that he was here.  The other brothers were supposedly present, but this was the guy who was looped in with the Mathers.  The Mathers family traded family members to and from other branches, connecting families and cementing ties.  The Mathers had also kidnapped kids.  Vince Crowley and his sister had been the ones handling the Crowley end of the deal.  They were smugglers, thieves, and general assholes who had dodged the reaching arms of the heroes, while providing shelter to the real monsters, and implicitly accepting some really fucked up stuff.The McVeays had been murderers and zealots, the Mathers were kidnappers, among other things, and Vince and Sabrina Crowley had been enablers.  They were smugglers, they’d kept kidnapping victims and sheltered murderers while there was too much attention and heat on them, and they’d almost gotten away with it, despite being up against the whole PRT.Sabrina had been caught, as were several sub-cells and supporters of that particular family unit.  They’d disappeared, they’d reappeared after Gold Morning, Sabrina back with her brother, and I knew about them because the patrol blocks were keeping tabs on them.“Capricorn’s back.  I’m doing stuff,” Looksee said.  “I’m checking- I don’t see news.  No rise in phone activity.  No posts online.”“He said tonight,” I said.“We’re getting closer to ‘night’,” Capricorn said.  Tristan.“Looksee,” I said.  “You had something keeping an eye on the phones in Hollow Point.  Your phone box?”“Yeah.”“Can you go backward?  See who these guys have been talking to?”The Jackass next to Vince whipped his head around.  Vince didn’t react much, but it was telling.  I added, “We know where they were in the building.  Can you use that to place the calls?”“Yup.  Well, not to who.  But I can figure out where.”“Perfect,” I said.  I met Vince’s eyes, trying to gauge what he thought.  Too hard to read.  “How hard will it be?”“Not hard,” she said.  “It’s already set up.  I punch in the location data.  Already half done.”“Already half done,” I told Sveta, my thumb on the switch to the microphone on the earbud’s cord.“Good job, Looksee,” Sveta murmured.“And done.  Gimme a minute.”I smiled.Part of the intent of my statement and the whole intent of the smile was to see what reaction it got from Vince Crowley.  It was provocative, yes – I knew I might push them to do something.  The real reason was to try and assess how serious of a thing this was.I could see the agitation of a couple of the Jackasses’.  Whatever they were, borderline sociopathic, brave to a fault, dangerous, they weren’t actors or bluffers.  Vince tried, but I could see a faint frown line between his eyebrows that hadn’t been there before.“Calls were made from the building they were in, just after they arrived.”“To?” Chris asked.“To… there was a flurry of them to a place that’s- it’s not far away.  I’m trying to find a map online to overlay and the webpage is glaaaacial.”The heroes who’d been at the perimeter were approaching now, jogging our way.  They would’ve been the final line of defense had the Crowleys kept running.  Three heroes local to Boston.  All wore bright colors and impractical costumes with extra flaps, layers, and extraneous bits of cloth that made them very ‘costumey’, in a way that made me think of a superhero in a kid’s show.Magic Knight Crash wore a high-collared top that hung off of him, leaving everything from armpit to pelvis exposed, while his front and back were covered.  He had four belts, not including straps at his arm and thigh, and he had a spiked shield mounted on the side of an engine that had a handle at the back and other side.  Seafoam and purple.Mystic Magic Impaler was similar, but she wore an eyepatch with a smiley face on it, a drill bit running through the smiley’s head.  The same icon was painted on the bare skin between cleavage and collarbone, and her outfit and hair were predominantly blue with some orange.  The entire setup had far too many ribbons for someone with power drill lances mounted on her wrists, the bits columns, not cones.  If the color scheme didn’t sell the image, the combination of power tools, long hair and loose clothing did.Dynamite Warrior Dash Fantastic was the most sane of them.  She at least avoided having twenty-plus things on her costume that her enemies could grab, and had some body armor, as paradoxical as it was to have her belly bare beneath a crop top with armor panels on it.  She was curvy, with a round face, and war paint on her cheekbones.  Her hair was short and pulled back in pigtails that were only an inch and a half long.  She didn’t have a weapon, unless the assault to the senses from the orange and purple camo counted.Yes, I had some loose clothing, and I had my hair out, but I also had the security of the wretch, and I’d made some effort to practicality, with the armor and coverage.  These guys treated practicality like it was the enemy.That wasn’t me jumping to conclusions.  I knew of the M.K.C. and M.M.I. pairing from before Gold Morning.  I’d been aware they’d made it through that, and their names had come up during the planning for this thing.  They’d been a ‘we’ll call and see if they’ll help’.  Despite appearances and past history, Tattletale had insisted they were trustworthy.  I’d secretly hoped they flake out like they’d been known to in past crises, even at the same time I’d known we needed all the assistance we could get.Uuuuuuuuuuuuuugh.“Working, working,” Looksee could be heard in the background.  “I’m finding more calls but Cap keeps blipping out and I’m trying to stay in touch with him.  I think my phone box is too far away.”“Sorry.  Keep it up,” Capricorn said.I closed my eyes.  I had to focus on the immediate present, and helping where I could help.“Who’s in charge?” I asked.“Me,” Dynamite said.“Who did you talk to before coming?”“Imp.  She called in a favor.”I hesitated.  Sveta nudged me.“He says something else is up.  We’re chasing it down.  Can you keep them in custody?  At least one has powers.”“It’s why we’re here,” Magic Knight Crash said.  He had colored lenses that masked his pupils and irises to make his eyes teal from corner to corner, and his mask covered his eyebrows, making it hard to read his expression.  He sounded confident, but the problem with these guys was that their entire persona was over the top confidence.“The guy with the beard is Vince Crowley.  Duplication of self and objects.  The duplications launch out, and he can put out a lot of them.  They don’t have much substance unless they overlap.  He’s usually not far from his sister, Sabrina, and we haven’t seen her.  She’s a mover on a mass scale.  Raider and getaway.”“That’s Empusa,” Dynamite said.“Yes,” I said.“She’s been seen around here.  She’s strong but she hasn’t done much.  We can deal with her.”“With a five hit drill punch combo,” Mystic Magic Impaler announced, floating off the ground.  She stabbed at the air with her drills.Fucking why was this a thing?  I felt embarrassed and it wasn’t even me saying it.“You can deal with him?” I asked, indicating Vince.  “Flood of projections?”“Would firepower work?  Cut or blast through it all?” Dynamite asked.  At my nod, she asked, “Can we kill him if he’s too much of a problem?”“Or maim?” Impaler asked.I felt something inside of me die at the question.  Yes, I’d threatened maiming, I even used maiming as a necessary tool, when there wasn’t a polite way to remove someone from a fight.  Impaler was trying so hard to celebrate it and make it her thing.“Leave him alive if possible,” I said.  “He might be one of the only ones who knows about this thing that’s going on.  If you get any inkling about what’s going on, call us, let us know.”“The deal was that I surrender only if I get a view,” Vince said.“A view of what?” Sveta asked.“Take us up to any rooftop.  I’ll sit, whistle, and wait,” he said.“Any rooftop?”“Ah,” he said.  He looked around.  “One with a view of the horizon.”Of the horizon.Shit, no.  I really hoped this was a head game.I exchanged looks with Dynamite.From what little I knew of Sabrina Crowley, who I could remember a little more easily because she didn’t blend in so much with her brothers, she charged up and released a ‘wave’ effect, about as tall and as big around as a house.  People in the original ‘cast’ could fly within the area of the slow-rolling wave, and there was some duplication trickery in there somewhere because she was from the Crowley family unit.  She used it to hit a location with a whole squad of people who could fly on top of having other powers, or to get her entire team away.And from what I knew of this team, they might have been just the right people to tackle that particular set of problems.“It would make it harder for Empusa to rescue him with her power.  We’d see her coming if she aimed at a rooftop,” Dynamite said.“If you’re okay with it,” I said.  “Okay.  Give him what he wants.”She put a hand out.  I clasped it for a moment.  She turned to her subordinates, and immediately began haranguing them in the manner of a no-nonsense prison guard that was used to dealing with unruly inmates.I felt a bit better about these guys now.“We should help Capricorn,” Sveta said.I nodded, putting a hand on her shoulder as we jogged away.  When we were a polite distance away, I took flight and Sveta grabbed my shoulder, using me for the first portion of her trip.“Coming your way, Capricorn,” I said.“He’s not on,” Looksee said.  “I will as soon as I get a stable signal again.”“Not on,” I repeated, for Sveta’s benefit.  “Do you have a location for the call recipient?”“Some.  A bunch, ackshully,” Looksee said.  “Fenway Station.  Calls made mid-event, when the brothers left the camp, and when they got to your area.”“We’re in Fenway station,” I said.  “That’s the name of the neighborhood.”“Fenway Station Station,” Looksee clarified.The issues of nomenclature.“Call the Wardens.  Don’t brick their phones.  Good work, Looksee”Trains, stores, people, parahuman security, a portal to Bet.Capricorn had Flechette -Foil- and Parian near him.  Parian was trying to guard the other two, Foil was picking off the members of the Clans and the Fallen that were still lingering near the building, and the Clan were trying to set fire to Parian’s dolls with thrown bottles.Capricorn, in turn, was extinguishing the fires with water, and working to trap the Fallen in stone, splashing them with water before turning it to stone.The idea had been to stay clear of the fight, but I couldn’t imagine someone calling themselves a hero with a straight face and not wanting to help those in need.Or needing to support those who were wanting help, maybe.The lies we told ourselves, when need trumped reason.Sveta went straight to Capricorn.  I went straight to the Fallen.There was one I recognized.  He wore a latex demon mask with paint on it, but I’d seen him a while ago, and he had Fallen flowing out from around him in a way that drew the eye when I was up in the air.  On the ground, he would have been one masked face in the shuffle.  In the air, I could see people emerging from the crowd, ducking out from between people when they hadn’t been there before.Maybe a small part of me had been looking for him.  When I had talked to the Attendant about joining, he’d been there.The latex mask being what it was, he didn’t seem to have the ability to see in the upper periphery of his field of vision.  He didn’t see me.  I had the wretch up on the descent, to protect myself, and I dropped it just before flying my knee into his jaw, the hit punctuated by a heavy dose of my aura.Swearing erupted around me.  His power was flaring up, visible now, with arcs of red-orange light dancing between the people in the crowd he’d been using to help form his gateways.  People shrieked and cussed as they were burned.Shouts overlapped.  The mob with a focus became a scramble.  Two people had one arc of portal energy, starting at one person’s foot, running up the side of his body, along his arm, and out to the other person’s hand, tracing down the body to the ground again.  As they parted, the arc stretched and snapped, flailing out and striking the crowd or ground before dissipating.  No serious damage done, to look at it, but the cracks and snaps were like whipcracks, driving the already retreating group to run more.  Elsewhere, more portals were breaking.  Some people were trying to stand still, fighting the tide of the crowd, because they had portals connected to them.There.  That was satisfying in a way I couldn’t put my finger on.  I couldn’t even stop to contemplate it.  I had to get to Capricorn, and we had to get to the station with the gateway to Earth Bet.A flare of light caught my attention, but it wasn’t portal light.  A molotov.There were people beneath me.  In the moment, not entirely sure if the bottle would break through my defenses and splatter me or hit the wretch and splatter it, I positioned myself and the Wretch between the bottle and the crowd.In that moment of acceptance of the fact I might burn, the memory of Crawler’s venom and the pain that had followed felt so real I felt like I was already on fire.  It hit me like a punch to the gut, and my breath caught in my throat.Idiots, the word flashed through my mind, aimed at the Fallen and members of the Clans.Idiot, the word flashed through my mind, the singular reserved for myself.The flaming projectile changed direction in midair, almost disappearing.  I could follow the path it took, the orange in the gloomy, overcast drizzle tracing a line through my vision like Capricorn’s power did.  I saw the explosion, the bottle cast off to the side, landing in an inconsequential patch of road.  Sveta had grabbed it.Other heroes from the perimeter were collapsing in.  I didn’t see anyone who might be the other Crowley brothers.  Jake and Cutter.I made two more quick strikes, targeting people who looked like they were giving orders or rallying the Fallen.  I saw someone in passing who might have been Victor, from Brockton Bay, and in the moment I was trying to decide if it would be wise to try to go after him, I saw that this wasn’t close to over.I flew to Capricorn, landing while still moving at a speed where I had to run a couple of steps and use a moment of flight to keep from stumbling.“Thank you,” I said, to Sveta.“Anytime.”There was no need to ask what it was.  She got it.  That- this, I liked it.  It would be nice to do the hero thing with her, even sometimes, even if the team fell through.“Did you catch what Looksee said?” Capricorn-Byron asked.Had I?  No.  I checked.  The cord dangled.  I popped it back in.  “Sorry, Looksee, my earphone came unplugged.”I could hear her, “I’m trying to figure this out.  There are cameras at the station.  I’ve notified security.  I’m getting other stuff through the camera feeds.  They’re in a restaurant, I think.”Byron became Tristan.  Tristan pointed, and we walked as a group.I turned to Foil as we passed her.  “Thanks.”“I wish we could talk more,” she said.“Soon.”Capricorn stopped in his tracks.  “We should tell Tattletale.”“Looksee?” I asked.  “She’s looped in, isn’t she?”“I’m talking to her when I get a chance,” Looksee said.  “She ignores half of what I say.”“She’s running ops,” Parian said.  “Besides, I think she’s worn out.”“This is big,” I said.  “The Fallen said he wanted to see the horizon when this hits.”“I’ll call,” Foil said.  “I’ll make the gravity clear.”“Thanks,” Capricorn said.“Good fighting beside you, Cap,” Foil said.He gave her a nod.The station wasn’t far.“You could have gone without me,” Capricorn said.We could have.  Just as Tattletale was worn out, so was I.  I was hurt and that hurt was a dull ache with a more intense pain at the center that made it feel like it had a core or something lodged in it.  Apparently a phantom symptom, with my nerves trying to process the damage.  My focus was slipping a bit.But I needed to be here.  This whole thing, others might have needed us to be here.  People still needed us, if there was anything to this attack or event tonight.“We…” I started, trying to voice my thoughts aloud.  “I hit things.  Sveta grabs things.  We can do other things, but… against a bomb?  Or whatever this is?”“You wanted a toolbox,” Sveta said.“I wanted more of a team,” I said.  “Looksee, listening in?”“Half listening.  I’m tracking these calls still.  If we can figure out who, we could figure out how or what.”“Good,” Capricorn said.“Can you defuse bombs, Looksee?”“Maybe.  I’d have to see the bomb.”“If you can, can you come?  Follow?”“I’ll head there.”“Chris?”There was a wet sound over the phone.“I think he ate the phone,” Looksee said.  “I hope he un-eats it before he changes back, or he’s going to need either surgery or a slot shaped butthole.  He’s near the station.”“Can we get him?” I asked.“We can try.  I’ll have my computer ping him until he listens.”“I’m running,” Capricorn said.  I was close enough to him that I could hear him on both phone and in person, with a bit of an echo.  “You guys move.  The kids can follow behind.  Keep an ear out for any calls to get away.”“Yuh huh,” Looksee replied, in the rushed kind of way that suggested she was too active or enthused to even form full words.  She’d been hurt and as close to sullen as Kenzie ever got, and that had faded into the background, almost forgotten.Capricorn broke into a run.  Sveta used her power to pull herself ahead.  I took to the air.“Hanging up for a sec,” I said.  “Wave at me if you need me on the phone.”“Got it,” Capricorn said.I used my speed dial.  I heard the phone ring twice.Droplets of moisture touched my skin as I flew.  Too far apart to be even a drizzle, it was moisture in the air.  Half of the sky was dark.  Too early for sunset, but the clouds were thick and the smoke and industry of the areas on the coast were contributing to the haze.“Victoria?” was the response.  Gilpatrick’s voice.  I could hear the bus in the background.  “What happened in Boston?”“It’s happening.  The Fallen have guns.  They were ready to shoot people.  Heroes are intervening.  It’s not important-”“It sounds important.”“No.  The Fallen have something big going on.  Retaliatory, I think, or it’s someone who’s talking to them and using the attack today as a distraction for other things.”“What kind of big?”“There’s a possible attack hitting Fenway Station.  We’re on our way there.”“We’re too far away, Victoria.”“The guy I’m hearing this from is saying he wants to see it.  On the horizon.  He said it while a few blocks away from the target location.  That could be him trying to mislead, but it could be…”“Other attacks?”“Call, please?  This is an all-hands on deck thing.”The station.  The building was made to look like an old building, even though it really wasn’t.  It was shaped like a plus sign, with a squat domed tower in the center, a red stone exterior, and arching entrances set at below ground level, with broad stairs leading down into them.  There was infrastructure around the building for refugee intake, but the buildings were locked down and shuttered.“You guys are there?” Looksee asked.  “I’ve got them on camera.  Sitting and drinking coffee while eating raspberry pie.  I’ve never had either of those things but that sounds like a bad combination.”“Just so long as they’re not doing anything,” I said.  Sveta caught up with me.  I pointed at one entrance while walking to another.  She nodded.“We don’t want to scare them,” Capricorn said.“We do want to be in a position to stop them,” I said.“Go in, stay put.”There were kids from the patrol in the building as I entered, more alert than they usually were.  They looked alarmed at my appearance.  Had word traveled this far in the past couple of minutes?I pushed my hood back and held up my hands, approaching at a walk.“Stop,” the junior captain said.  She was black, a teenager Rain’s age, her hair shaved at the side and brushed back and away from her face at the top.  She had the ‘cop’ look down one hundred percent.  The technique too- she’d already had her gun in hand, out of sight, and she raised it to point it my way without hesitation.  I could admire that kind of fluid confidence, as someone who’d once had the same position.“We’re on your side,” I said.  “You just got an alert, right?”She nodded.“I gave the info to Captain Gilpatrick at Bridgeport.  I’ve worked with him.  He passed it to others.  Something big is up, and we think the culprits are in the restaurant with the pie.”She didn’t ease up.“You’ll want to evacuate,” I said.  “Do it soft, we don’t want to tip those guys off.  Don’t let people enter, encourage them to leave if you can do it quiet.  Let the place naturally empty.”A light flashed at the desk, at a point I couldn’t see- but I could see the green LED reflected on the glossy black body armor she wore.  Nicer quality stuff than we’d had, but I supposed that came with the big city.“Ben,” she said.One of her squad members reached for the phone.  There was a pause.“Bosses and cops say there’s someone at the other door.  Obvious parahuman.  We’re supposed to send one or two that way for numbers.”Bosses would mean captain.  Cops would be the local authorities.  One of the two should’ve been making the real decisions.  There should have been one close by here.“That’s Sveta,” I said.  “She’s a case fifty-three.  My friend and teammate.  With the current emergency, we approached from two angles.”“Yeah,” the Junior Captain said.  Her voice was level.  “Tell them we’ve got one too.”“We’ve got one too,” the guy said, into the phone.  “We’ve got two, actually.”I looked where he was looking.  It was Capricorn.“Oh, I know you,” the junior captain said.  “Capricorn, right?”“Yeah,” Capricorn said.“You’re a hero.  You’ve been active out there.  Somewhere near Fairfield?”“Cedar Point.  She’s a hero too.”“And Sveta,” I said.“Yeah,” he said.  “If my word counts for anything.”The suspicion wavered, and then it gave.  She held the gun in one hand, and reached for the phone with the other.So many hurdles.  But the captain communicated the situation, and she communicated my suggestion about the people being evacuated.  The patrol squad went for another patrol, and they talked to people.“All stations are evacuating for now,” Junior Captain Eads said.  She’d eased up considerably, after her superiors had gotten the okay.  “Trains are stopped, emergency staff is being called in.  Heroes are in.”Looksee arrived almost ten minutes later.  We were still lingering near the doors, so Looksee sat on the bottom stair, getting out her computer.  Capricorn crouched by her in a position I would’ve been hard pressed to maintain before my legs started complaining, and I wasn’t wearing plated armor.“No word from Tattletale?”“Two words.  She said ‘on it’.  I don’t think she likes me much,” Looksee said.“I did paint her as a pretty horrible person, didn’t I?”“Ha,” Looksee said, without humor.  “We’ve got our targets on camera, see?”Capricorn spoke out of the side of his mouth, while crouched near Looksee.  “Maybe don’t announce that we’re tapped into their security while their people with guns and cops are ten feet away.”Two women and six men at two separate tables.  No costumes.  The restaurant was emptying.  There was one member of the staff walking around, cleaning tables.  Maybe a manager.Keeping up the facade?  Heroes came in all forms.What the hell were they up to?A private message window popped up in the corner.  Tattletale.Tattletale:



call logs. ur right. they r hitting every station with a portal



I let people know.Every station.  My heart skipped a beat.I looked over at Captain Eads.  She was staring at me, looking alarmed.“They’re hitting all of the stations.”“Every one with a portal,” I said.“They’re shutting us down.  Closing us off.”“Capricorn,” Looksee said.  “Victoria.”She had our attention.Tattletale:



tinkr devices. they all have one. under chairs in bags. hit them b4 they can useIt was a message to us, but from the reaction, I had the sense the message was going out to every team and station.I adjusted my costume, flipping up my hood.  Capricorn stood.  Looksee drew her flash gun.  Patrol soldiers had their weapons out.  Older soldiers were jogging over from one of the other entrances.  Leaders for this particular exercise.“Their parahuman wants to be the one to make the first move,” one soldier said.“Who?”“The girl with the painted armor.”“Sveta.  Let me set up, and I’m all for it,” Capricorn said.The minutes that followed were silence punctuated by bursts of movement so intense that it felt like the situation had just erupted.  Boots on the ground, as patrol officers went to one wing or another.  Then laughter, somewhere, eerily out of tune with the feeling we had near the entrance.  Fake, to create a sense of normalcy, when the groups at the table might be noticing how quiet things were getting?At every station, there had to be a situation like this unfolding.We had no idea who these guys were.  They might’ve been friends of the Fallen, but that was open-ended.“Going,” Capricorn’s voice came over the phone, a whisper made loud.I was looking around the corner as Sveta went around the corner across from me, entering the hallway, snapping over to the entrance to the restaurant, and disappearing inside.Capricorn came back in from outside at a run.  I flew in, and the officers were ready behind me.I was just in time to see Sveta skidding on the floor.  She spied the target and grabbed it where it apparently sat on the booth seat beside one of the people at the table, and hauled it to her with enough force that it produced a spatter of blood when it clipped the face of the guy sitting by it.Then she was out, case in hand, and we were in.  A restaurant with red, white, and black tile, black booths, and pretty looking tables.  It was cold on the one side because windows were open, and noticeably warm on the other because heat radiated from the kitchen.Sabrina was one, or another Fallen with Crowley genes was.  When she used her power, she clarified the point- a shimmering bubble around herself, wet with waves rolling, overlapping and crashing around it.  Energy shimmered and danced wherever two waves met.Beside her, someone was using a changer power, manifesting bone armor and a long limb at their right hip.  Possibly a whip.Someone shot Sabrina.  I carried right past her to the changer, and hit it hard enough to shatter the bone armor and send them sprawling.  Capricorn used his power, and water came in through the open windows, flooding the restaurant and knocking just about everyone at the far end off their feet.  All members of the other group.It wasn’t a pretty fight.  It wasn’t even an exciting fight.  It was a trap closing, where I was the jaws of the mousetrap slamming down, Capricorn was the pitfall and the bucket of water they were unceremoniously forced to deal with.  Sveta was the snare.Even with a bullet in her, Sabrina used her power anew, surrounding herself and her teammates.  Her teammates rose up, each one flying within the bubble, with double images forming around each.  Other things were lifted as well- tables and chairs.People took shots.  Most hit the strategically placed and doubled furniture.Sabrina fired a handgun from behind cover.  One shot, and I heard four impacts as the shots landed.  Passing through or traveling through the bubble, the bullets were multiplied.I had the Wretch pick up a table as I flew.  It was my shield, above and beyond what the Wretch offered.  I rammed into the floating cover Sabrina had erected around her people and drove that cover into them.  One flew back and away, stunned, and had a tentacle grab them from the window behind them.It was my means of taking Sabrina’s booth that she was using as cover and, overturning the table that had been damaged by wretch and bullet alike, place it over her head, capping her in the booth.She had to fly out, floating in her bubble, moving low to the ground.  Anticipating her, I flew to meet her, diving and putting my foot where mirror images overlapped.  I kicked her chest-first into the floor, and I could hear the clack of her teeth as her chin met the floor a fraction of a second later.We’d left little room for counterplay.  No room for proper reactions, beyond the wild and desperate attempt to fight back.Just like that, it was over.Nobody who knew anything relaxed.  The captains called in that we’d succeeded.  The confirmation came back.  All looked good.  All clear from Looksee and Tattletale.  Sveta handed the tinker case to a professional.Everyone who knew something about the situation remained ready, waiting for the next shoe to drop.“Good work,” Junior Captain Eads said.There was nowhere to go.  Nothing to do.  We’d done our job, the people with the know-how were interrogating who they could find, and answers would come soon.But the answers had to wait.  The other stations- well, they had to handle their own stuff.  The closest portal to us was really Brockton Bay, and Brockton Bay wasn’t that close.  Our station was busy with cleanup, with questions and no answers.  We were in the way, and we couldn’t go elsewhere to help because things would be over before we arrived.We had nowhere to go except- almost by silent agreement, we made our way outside.As Vince Crowley had wanted to do, we found a vantage point to watch the horizon.The messages began coming in on phones.“Norwalk station,” Kenzie said.“That’s your neighborhood,” Sveta replied.Kenzie nodded.  She was typing quickly.  “My parents look okay.  Reports are coming in.  The sky- a slice of pink?  I don’t get it.  Things seem mostly fine.  What happened?”“Hey,” Capricorn said.  He touched Sveta’s shoulder.  “Look.”Off to the north.Brockton Bay couldn’t catch a break.  It was like a shard of glass or a torn piece of painting.  I could see the sky on the other side.  The world beyond.They were opening the portals wider.  Taller.  A portal that large- it had to have sliced Brockton Bay in half.  What did that impact?  What did it do?We’d have to take off- where?We had somewhere to go now, yet we were paralyzed.  The phone had a list of portals, now, and one by one, the gray rectangles turned green with checkmarks, or were marked with red ‘x’s.One by one, places were deemed okay or thrust into new crisis.  The city had barely been holding up as it was.Green.  Green.  Green.  Red.  Green.  Red…I stopped focusing on the successes and failures, and turned my attention to my contact list.  Crystal.  Gilpatrick.  Dad.  Mom.I sent the messages and waited for the replies.  In the times between waits, I typed out hurried explanations, as far as we had any.  It seemed like hours were passing and it seemed like no time at all was passing and we were stuck in a horrible, unresolved moment for an eternity.On the horizon, another slice of sky that wasn’t overcast, in the midst of sunset.  A spear or blade of the wrong light, cast across a community.A reply from Crystal.  Her team would be out and helping, as soon as they knew what was going on.  If this opened the doors wide for Earth C… what would we even do?Fight.Mom was okay.  She told me that Amy was okay, and I let her.  Dad was fine.  Gilpatrick, Jasper, Ashley and Rain were okay.No response from Weld.New York was the central hub because it was the place with the densest cluster of portals.  The phone noted several failures in that area.No response from the Wardens.  They would be getting bombarded.  Maybe it was that.Hard to convince myself of that, but I tried.  If three portals failed, what happened?  Did they open so wide that each intersected with the others?  What happened to something caught in the middle?No response from Fume Hood or Tempera.Crystalclear was well.  He’d been manning one station, and his group had succeeded in finding and catching the person who had brought the tinker device there.  The portal widening device.I stood, unable to keep sitting, my phone still in my in hand.  Sveta sat with Kenzie, the two of them looking at the same phone.  Capricorn was off to the side, sitting against a wall.  Chris typed.A response from Weld, brief, and Sveta burst into tears.  I sat down next to her to hug her.  When she stood up a minute later, pacing, I remained where I was, keeping an eye on Kenzie and an eye on my phone.There was an agitation that was taking over.  I could see it in everyone’s body language.Phones here and there beeped, people scrolled.Only the anxiety.It wasn’t quite true, I knew, but I imagined it all the same.  That we couldn’t bring ourselves to raise the subject, but we were all doing the same things at the same time anyway.   We sat and we poked at our phones, and we convinced ourselves it wasn’t true, we stabbed fingers at the phone with more vigor, as if that could somehow get through and evoke a response.  We searched, told ourselves it was a congested network, and held off on sending messages while hoping for one more.  The realization settled in, and it wasn’t the good kind of settling.Each and every one of us had one name in common, someone they cared about, and for some, one of the only responsible adult figures who cared about them in turn.  She had every reason to be right at the epicenter, which didn’t make it better.Today had proven more than anything that these guys still needed her.  What the hell was this team going to do without its therapist?                                                                                        Torch – 7.1                                                                                        I gripped until my fingernails threatened to penetrate the skin, squeezing, strangling, until my hand hurt and my bullet wound hurt more.  The pain in the bullet wound intensified, until the muscle started to cramp.“Relax.”Relaxing my grip was a thing I had to tell myself how to do, more than pushing on through the pain had been.  I released the stress ball with the doofy character face on the front.  Bloodshot eyes receded into sockets and the mouth closed to settle into the infuriating little grin.  My handprint remained as an indent on the ball’s thin skin, slowly disappearing.“Agh,” I made a sound.  The cramping feeling in my arm wasn’t going away.  It was like a charlie horse, but more intense than any I’d had.“Are you okay?  Was it too much?”  She gingerly touched my arm, being shy of the wound, and felt out the muscle.  “Let me know if this hurts.”I nodded, because I couldn’t really talk.  The massage helped.  It did hurt, when the fingers pulled against skin closer to the bullet wound, but the massage soothed the cramp enough that the pain was worth enduring.“I wasn’t sure if you were using super strength or if it was you,” she said.Then ask, I thought, the pain sharpening thoughts that might not have been so sharp five minutes ago or five minutes from now.“Well, it seems like you have good strength in your hands.”“It doesn’t feel strong,” I said.“Okay.  Not to worry!  That’s something we can work on.”Anne Lynn was my physical therapist with a first and middle name that she’d insisted were to be used together because she was not an ‘Anne’ and she definitely wasn’t a ‘Lynn’.  Okay, fine.  Going by first impressions, she seemed to be a lovely, warm, caring person who was painfully new to what she was doing.  She went to her mentor, who was in our mostly empty activity area, for things I didn’t imagine really needed clarification or reassurance.  She did much the same for me, double-checking what I said in a way that made me think she wasn’t taking me at my word.It seemed she also didn’t ask for clarification at times she needed it.She was a hard person to really dislike or resent, though.  She was shorter than average, cute and bubbly, and her smile seemed persistent and genuine.  That was a hard thing to find, given recent events.“No super strength, for the record,” I said.  “I turned it off.  It kind of defeats the point, doesn’t it?”“We should make sure that works as you heal,” she said.“It’s not a concern,” I said.  “I could be the strongest or weakest person in the world and it won’t affect how my super strength works.”“Oh?  Okay, got it.  If you’re sure.”There it was.  The vague impression she doubted me.  Was I being unfair?“If you keep me talking about this I’m going to go full powers geek on you,” I said.She snorted.  “That’s convincing.  Oh no, please don’t tell me about your power or show me anything neat!”“Ahhh,” I said.  So she’d hoped to see something.  I thought about how much she didn’t want to see my uncontrolled forcefield in action, and I smiled anyway.  “Maybe sometime.”“Sometime, if you’re comfortable doing it.  But not today, our session is just about over.   How’s your arm feeling?”I tried moving it.  The cramp had mostly subsided.  “Better.”She smiled, reaching for the shelf under the bench I was sitting on.  Papers and plastic bags rustled.  She put a pile of stuff beside me.  “I have stuff for you.”“Homework.”“Some!  Papers, this one has your instructions for your physiotherapy you can do at home.  We want to keep up your hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder strength while letting your arm recover.  This paper here has some recommended tips for recovery and pain.  On the backside, we have some things to watch out for.”“Neuromas, muscle cramps lasting for long periods of time, persistent fever, swelling that appears suddenly or doesn’t let up.  Got it.”“If any exercises are too painful for you to do, make a note.  I’ll see you in two days and you can tell me then.  We’ll figure out if there’s something wrong or if it’s something we want you to work through.  If I don’t know for sure then I’ll talk to someone who does.  We’ll meet two days after that session, then scale down to twice a week after that, and once a week toward the end.”“My doctor told me I should expect two to four more weeks recovery.”“That’s for the muscle damage.  Longer with the bone healing, but my notes say that was minor.  I printed this out for you.  Bone fracture healing is explained on this sheet.  I included a copy of the list your doctor gave for the supplements to take.  Okay, that’s all the papers.  We have some slings for you- various colors and styles.”A sling.  Ugh.  “Great.”“And finally, a bag of rubber bands for some of the hand exercises and-” she paused, raising a bag filled with colorful stress balls.  “Stress helpers!  We have a variety!”There was a part of me that wanted to groan at the forced cheer, and at the even more forced use of ‘helper’.  I went with it, maintaining a smile and peering at the bag.  It wasn’t worth making her an adversary.“We have the faces, Grimace Gus, Dopey Dan, Pinhead Pam, and a few others.  I have a few of these myself.  You can pick one to represent someone you hate and channel that emotion into getting better.”No blonde Smug Susans.  Too bad.Hearing Anne Lynn get so excited over little toys helped me put my finger on her image and way of presenting herself.  She made me think of a kindergarten teacher.  I could imagine her hyping up a class of munchkins with the same attitude she’d shown around me.I poked the bag.  It was a resealable bag, but it was old enough that it had crinkled and scuffed to the point it was foggy.  “You have a few of these, huh?  Do you have a Grimace Gus in your life?”“I do,” Anne Lynn said.  “But it’s mostly the Dopey Dan and Pinhead Pam that give me grief.  Family.”“Ah.  I hear you on that.”  I liked her a little more than I had, hearing that.  I peered at the bag.“We have other things, like the animal balls.  Let’s see… beetle, ick, the bird, the snake, the lion-”“Lion,”  I said.“Do you want to check the bag?  There are others.”“The lion would be great, thank you,” I said.  “I had a childhood toy that was a lion.”“Perfect,” she proclaimed, while retrieving the lion.  It was just a head, with two black dots for eyes, no mouth, and the mane taking up three quarters of it, with ears poking up on top.  “Your therapy partner for when you’re not with me.  Treat each other well.”There was a part of me that felt like she was treating me like a kid, but that might have been her usual demeanor.  I could have rankled at it or said something, and I didn’t.  Another part of me that felt very tired, and that part of me welcomed having a stress doll that reminded me of the stuffed toy I’d loved to the point it had looked monstrous.  That tired part of me almost welcomed the cheer and the being taken care of.Picking my sling was a little less interesting than picking the stress ball.  I tried on two and went with the most comfortable, holding it instead of putting it on.  I said my farewell to Anne Lynn and walked past others who were in the midst of their own exercises at parallel bars, benches, and weight machines.One woman with tan skin, black and gray exercise clothing and her hair in a bun was at the weight machines.  She gave me a nasty look.  I had no idea who she might be.I dropped my stuff off at my locker, then made use of the shower that was adjacent to the therapy area.  It wasn’t that I’d worked up a serious sweat, but I hadn’t slept well, and so I’d flown around before my appointment, checking that all was well.All wasn’t well.Rinsing off gave me a chance to refresh myself, resetting to zero, and it allowed me to change my clothes.  What I wore for a doctor’s appointment and preliminary therapy session wasn’t going to serve for the rest of the day.  Once I’d dried off, I put on a top with a collar that had a fine gold zipper instead of buttons, chosen because it was easy to put on with an injured arm.  I pulled on a pair of olive slacks that served as good all-purpose pants.  The pants proved to be less of a stellar choice with two stubborn buttons that needed doing up, but they were business casual and they’d survive if a fight broke out, which I wasn’t quite ruling out.I stopped at the mirror to braid my damp hair as best as I could with the one hand, taking my time to do it, and then put a bit of makeup on around my eyes.  I was mid-application when the woman with the bun who’d given me a dirty look passed through the shower room, walking behind me and into the locker room, eyeing me as she passed.I almost said hi.  Maybe I would in the future.I got my things, put them in a bag, took a minute to situate my arm in the sling, and situated my bag on my other arm.Leaving the building, I left the smell of sweat made muggy by showers behind me and ventured into the cool outdoors, closing my eyes against the cold sun.  Opening those eyes, I saw the gold-tinted city and a mostly blue sky that would have been pleasant in any other circumstance.Pleasant if the horizon hadn’t been shattered like a dropped mirror.  The sky was divided, with vague shapes stabbing up into it, the sky on the far side taking on different tints and weather.The portals hadn’t been flat doors that things could pass through, but three dimensional objects, transition points with rules that we’d simplified by driving trains straight through them.  Nothing about it was simple now.Four portals in this area of the city had been drawn out to a height taller than our tallest buildings, and expanded out to encompass multiple city blocks.  The fourth had been a surprise by a parahuman that had used a power to hide until the heat had died down.  The worst expansion covered twelve blocks, and it would have covered more if it hadn’t been close to the water.At the edges of those portals, buildings and one bridge had collapsed.  Within the areas encompassed?  We still didn’t know.  The portals had expanded out, bled into one another to surround one of the more critical areas of the city, because that area had been centered to be symbolically near the largest cluster of portals, and they’d scrambled.  They didn’t point to where they once had.I checked the coast was clear enough that I wouldn’t scare anyone, and I took flight.The bugs in the city were bad, stubborn even as the weather was cooling down.  It had been that way for a while, but the spring and fall seemed worst.  They hadn’t gotten the message yet, that the city was here and wildlife and insect life needed to move elsewhere.  Now, though, we had wind.  Different earths had different weather and we had gaping holes in our city with starkly different pressures on one side than we had on the other.  Flying, I could feel it.I could feel it more as I flew over the portals, to the point that I was course correcting more than I was flying forward.  Crosswinds.  If my hair hadn’t been in a braid, it would have been all over me.In the center of the portals, three separate doors sloshed together.  The Wardens headquarters had been there.  Key members and staff of the three sub-teams and the Wardens themselves had been stationed there when it had all gone to hell.  Jessica had been working late.Option one suggested that they’d been torn to shreds, caught by three portals that were clashing together and switching what world they were connected to moment by moment, until they finally stopped expanding and settled.Option two might have been worse.  The Wardens’ head office had been serving as a place to sequester dangerous capes.  Slaughterhouse Nine, ex-Birdcage capes, international enemies, and Class-S threats like Nilbog.  Even the ones who had been cooperating had been kept under close guard because cooperation didn’t necessarily equate trust.If Jessica and the other late-evening staff at the Wardens’ HQ were out there, stranded somewhere after the portals swallowed the area up, then they weren’t in good company.  I imagined it ending up something like the Lord of the Flies, if the talking severed pig’s head was the least fucked up around.It wasn’t a good imagining.Construction crews were working to mend the damage.  Building hadn’t even begun on the structures that might contain the portal.  It was a herculean undertaking, even with powers helping.Even after I returned to the streets, the wind was something I noticed, a constant gust that was either coming or going from the direction of the disaster.Life moved on like normal but the cold wind blew hard.  People on the street kept their heads down and walked briskly, even less likely to make eye contact or offer a kind word than they had been before this.  Businesses were the same, when they were open.  That was saying something, considering this area was the closest thing we had to New York.Brockton Bay, when I’d paid a visit, had been similar enough.  It had been more of a slice, cutting the city and its industry in two, leaving one half without power or internet.  The attitude shift had been felt there too.All of the affected areas.  The affected areas of the city felt like ghost towns that weren’t empty nor were they towns.  The warmth wasn’t there, there wasn’t a soul or community, and everything felt eerie.  Too new, too worn out for how new they were, insects clustered on warm surfaces, and too many businesses were closed with all lights off, despite their posted hours.It was no surprise that I arrived early at the meeting place and yet Kenzie had beaten me there.  She was at the table with her laptop, hair immaculate, and what looked like a set of two individual hair pins that were each one part of a heart, the heart split down the middle by a crack.  She wore both halves, the pins set in her hair so the cracks meshed.  I wasn’t sure if it was meant to be a ‘BFF’ style thing where each friend wore one, or if she was supposed to wear each pin on one side of her head.  She wore a maroon dress with a pattern of black scribbled hearts, and black tights.Her dad stood by.  He wore a long peacoat, one side of the collar turned up against the wind.  His hair had pulled away in strands that swayed with the wind.The patio area was otherwise empty.  The business it served was closed.  There weren’t that many people on the street.“Victoria is here,” he said.Kenzie sat up to peer over the top of the screen, her eyes large.“You’re early,” I said.  I sat in the chair across from her, scooting it over so I could see past the laptop to her, and see Julien standing behind her.  Considering we were nearly as close as we could get to the city center without being able to see the base of the portals, there weren’t many people around.“I like seeing people arrive places.  When they arrive and where they sit tells you things.”“Does it?”“Yep.  People sit closer to people they have an affinity with. It’s not always people they like, but it’s usually people they relate to.  And whether you’re a boy or girl matters.  Girls tend to sit next to others or across from others, but guys sit diagonally across.  Once you start noticing it, you’ll see it all over the place.  It’s a puzzle.”“You like that kind of thing, huh?”She nodded.I leaned back into the back corner of my chair, the armrest and the wall beside me supporting me as much as the chair back did.“How’s your arm?” she asked.  She closed her laptop and turned it over, pressing her hands down on the warm underside.“Doctor said it’s healing well.  I’ll spare you the gorier details.  Physio started today.”“What happened?” Julien asked.“I told you this stuff, dad,” Kenzie said.“When you tell me things it comes in a stream.  I pick out what I can.”“I got shot,” I said.  “In and out.  I had to have two fragments of bone removed.”“I’ve been shot,” Julien said.  “Twice.  Except I didn’t get physio or doctor’s appointments after.”“I only know about the once,” Kenzie said.“Both before she was born,” Julien told me.  “I grew up in a neighborhood where you either went to a gang or the gang came for you.  I went to them when I was twelve, they raised me.  I got shot once while working for them, and once when I left and didn’t keep it secret enough.”“I only heard about the second one,” Kenzie said.“Why did you leave?” I asked.“If you asked me then, I would have said there were different middle managers.  Now?  Wasn’t me.”“You said you were good at it,” Kenzie said.  “Sales.”“Mm hmm,” Julien said.  “It wasn’t good for me.”“I can respect that,” I said.  “Leaving.  That can’t have been easy.”“Thank you,” he said.  He looked down at Kenzie.  “Was she at any risk?”“Dad.”“Minimal to no risk,” I said.  “Given how everything went last week, it might have been riskier for her to stay home.”“My wife invited you over, but with everything that happened and the station exploding near our home, you’ll need to give us a few days to get organized.”“It’s a mess,” I said.Julien nodded.  His hand rose to his chin as he stroked his beard.  His eyes were on the distance, first on the shattered horizon, and then on the street.  “I can’t tell which one that is.”I turned to look, wincing as my elbow banged the chair back.I couldn’t tell who it was either.  He walked with confidence, head high, but his hair had no paint or dye, and it was combed neat.  He wore a vest over a button-up top.  A lot about that image seemed to convey ‘Tristan’, but the lack of color and the more serious expression didn’t.  He seemed to have Tristan’s build, but the cut of the outfit could have created that illusion.  It was a nice suit, minus the suit jacket.“Victoria.  Kenzie.  Good to see you two.  Mister Martin,” he said, as he arrived at the table.  By voice and manner of speaking?  That was Tristan.“Tristan,” Julien Martin replied.  He put a hand on Kenzie’s chair back.  “Kenzie.  You wanted me to stay until people came?”“You can go, dad.  Thank you for sticking around.”He gave us a nod, and with hands in the pocket of his coat, he walked to his car, which was in what should have been a heavily contested parking spot.Kenzie smiled, giving me a shrug.  “Sorry.”“Why sorry?” I asked.“He’s embarrassing.”“You pick the weirdest words,” Tristan said.“Embarrassing doesn’t feel like the most accurate fit.”“What do you think about him, then?” she asked.  She leaned forward, hands still on her laptop.“I-” I started.  “Is it undiplomatic to say he gives me a weird vibe?”“No,” Tristan said, settling into his chair.“No,” Kenzie said.  The smile fell from her face.  “I give off a weird vibe, too.  I had to get it from somewhere, so obviously I overachieved and got a full share from each of my parents.”“Speaking of overachieving and casual segues away from uncomfortable topics,” Tristan said.  “I like the saintly laying-on-hands you’re doing for your laptop there.  That’s a new thing.”“It’s warm and my hands are cold, duh.”“Of course.  Too bad, I liked the image of you as technology Jesus.”She closed her eyes, leaning back, and hummed.  She kept her eyes closed as she stopped humming, and said, “I wish I actually got to go to Church enough that I could know something fancy to say.”“I’m not much of a memorizer,” Tristan said.  “Most of what I could tell you is what I remember from choir.  I could give you Byron, but I don’t know how he’d feel about that.”“No, it’s okay.  Not a big deal,” Kenzie said.Chris was making his way down the street.  Where Tristan had been confident and well dressed, Chris wore a sweatshirt and ducked his head.  He had the headphones on, but not the braces.  He looked very much like a thirteen year old boy, down to the sullen look in his eyes.“What the hell, Tristan?  I feel underdressed,” Chris said.“You dressed up a little,” Kenzie said.  “No braces.  It’s nice.”“No braces because I have back to back dentist appointments,” Chris said.  He put one finger at the corner of his mouth, yanking it back to show his teeth.  The mounts for the braces were still on the teeth, and two of the teeth were missing.  A canine and the molar behind it, at the top.“You changed too much,” Tristan made it a statement and not a question.“And I got dry socket.  I’m fucking miserable.”“You shouldn’t change too much.”“Oh yes, thank you Tristan.  I completely forgot.  I need and want to change, in case you forgot.  Like right now, I want to get back home and change into a puddle of flesh with no nerve endings or teeth.  But we’re doing this instead.”“We’re just missing Sveta,” I said.“The only person without a phone.  Great,” Chris said.“The trains are down so getting here is tough.  I know it sucks, but stick it out,” I said.“Do you have any fun painkillers your doctor prescribed you?”“I have some.  I’m not going to give them to a minor who didn’t have them prescribed to him.  Do you want a boring over-the-counter painkiller instead?”Chris nodded, and I got a bottle from my bag, passing it across the table to him.He tipped four or five pills into his hand and before I could get an accurate count or realize what he was doing, tossed them back into his mouth, swallowing them dry.“Chris!”“Fuck off,” he said.  “I know my physiology and I know what I’m doing.”“You keep saying that,” I said.  “It sounds less convincing each time.”“Chris!” Kenzie said.  “Do you know any good prayers I could say over my laptop?  It’s a thing we were talking about.”“Do I strike you as the churchgoing type?”“Nothing?”“Some random latin.  Ex nihilo nihil fit, I think is a good phrase for you.”“Why do I feel like you just insulted me?” Kenzie asked.“It’s not insulting, nimrod.  It’s actually a compliment.”“Aww!”“Which I’m regretting now.”“I’m struck between the fact that you know that, first of all,” I said.“I spend a lot of time reading when I’m waiting out a form.”“And the fact you’re doubling down on the moody teenage boy thing.  Most just get into nihilism, but you fit two ‘nihil’ in one sentence there.  What is that?  Word, nothing, nothing, word?”“Why do I even talk?” Chris asked, leaning back.  He pulled his hood down over his eyes.Sveta arrived, spotting us before jogging to us in an ungainly way that made me worry she might fall.  She didn’t crash to the ground, but she did teeter, and stopped, her hand resting against a window to catch her balance.She wore long sleeves, a new wig, and her body was scrubbed of paint.  Her dress was long, layered in stages of darkening green from layer to layer, with shapes cut out of each lower portion.  Fish or leaves, it looked like.“I love the dress,” I said.“Oh, this?  It was a gift from Chief Armstrong,” she said.  “I’m sorry I’m late.”“It’s fine,” I said.  “I don’t think we’re all late.”She smiled.  “I’m weirdly nervous.”“It’s a weird thing,” Tristan said.It was a weird thing.  In timing and place, in atmosphere, and in aim and objective.The wind whipped around us as the five of us walked as a group.  There weren’t any crowds, and the building was largely empty as we made our way inside.  The interior of the building was dim, but it was mostly because the lights were off and illumination came from the windows to the outside.“No word on Mrs. Yamada?” Tristan asked.“No,” Sveta said.  “Not according to Weld.”“And we don’t know who was behind it?”“Not yet,” I said.There were some simple folding chairs lined up down the wide hallway.  Either end of the building had large windows, which let the light come in, casting its long, vague shadows.  Some people were already in the hallway, clustered in groups.There was a man sitting alone who gave me a curious look as we looked for a spot to situate the five of us.  He was the kind of guy I might have imagined as a kid’s baseball coach, with a bit of a belly, short hair, and a soft expression with lines in the forehead.  As easygoing as he looked in the moment, I could imagine him getting really intense in the right occasion.He stood when he saw me, and that got my attention.I left the group to approach him.“Do I know you?”“Not yet,” he said.  Before he continued, I was already placing his voice from the phone.  “We had an appointment today.  I’m Dr. Darnall.”“Oh,” I said.  I felt momentarily awkward and weirded out both.  “I’m sorry to reschedule on you.”“It’s fine,” he said.  “Both reschedules were for very good reasons.”Outpatient surgery and this.“You’re here, though.”“I was asked to consult,” he said.  “When you rescheduled to attend, I realized the connection to this.  I thought I’d look in and see how he made out, and get our first meeting out of the way, so you don’t have to worry about it.”“I’m not worried,” I said.  “I’m just trying to work out a lot of things, and timing gets awkward.”“Absolutely,” he said.  He had an easygoing tone.  “Is that the team you’re looking after?”“Kind of.  They’re not so much a team anymore, but I do want to look after them.”The group was all together, talking, with Sveta being the one to look momentarily exasperated.  Each one of them was glancing my way now and again, checking on me.  When the door opened, they would look, waiting to see if we’d see Rain or Ashley.“Understood,” he said.“They’re catching up after a week of everyone going their own way.”“You don’t need to justify or explain, Victoria.  These things are complicated.  If you want to talk about it someday, we can.  If you don’t want to talk, that’s fine too.”“I’d rather they had therapists than I had one,” I said.“I’d like it if they had therapists too, but I don’t have the room in my schedule.  When the plane is going down, it’s important to put your own oxygen mask on first.  If we can’t address all of their issues, we can at least help you enough that you can help them.  If you want.”“Mrs. Yamada- you know her, right?”“I do.  We were friends.  I attended her cousin’s wedding with her.  As a friend of hers.”Weird to think about.  I’d never heard mention of a cousin.“She thought something really bad was going on with this group.  It could be really serious.”“Yeah,” he said.  He glanced at the window, where the shattered skyline was visible in the distance.  A damaged building still stood, but with a chunk missing.  The girders and beams stabbed out into the gap left by the missing chunk.  Black bones and a tinted yellow exterior.  “She seemed very worried about something.  She didn’t confide in me about it.  I can’t think of many others she would have talked to.”“It’s on my mind,” I said.The door opened.  I glanced at it, checking to see if it was Rain or Ashley.  It wasn’t.  It was a middle-aged woman with glasses.“Rain Frazier,” she said.People began filing in.  The others made way for others to pass while looking in my direction.“I won’t get in your way,” he said.  “I’ll be in the back, seeing how I’ll have to leave.  I have an appointment with a patient in ten minutes.”“It was nice to meet you,” I said.  “Sorry for rescheduling.”“I work with superheroes and supervillains.  Some stay up all night, others run off to manage crises partway through most sessions.  A couple of reschedules isn’t a blip on my radar.”“You still came to find me.”He shrugged.  “My clients rub off on me.  Sometimes you can’t limit yourself to chasing after or staking out and waiting.”“Getting out ahead of the problem,” I said.“If you want to put it that way,” he said.I nodded.The others were waiting for me, so I ducked my head in a quick farewell and went to join them.It wasn’t a courtroom, but there was a layout that echoed one.  A series of tables had people behind them.  A woman from the Wardens that had been there when we’d pitched our response to the Fallen hit, then others I didn’t know.  An old man, another.Ashley was sitting in one of the chairs off to one side, and so we all joined her, filing in to sit around her.Rain sat past the divider, facing down the tribunal.  He’d cut his hair.With us, Ashley looked the same.  Kenzie sat beside her, her head leaning on Ashley’s shoulder.What did it say, when I had no idea what outcome we wanted?  He wanted consequence.  Whether he was found responsible or somehow allowed to go free, the resolutions felt right and wrong both.                                                                                        Torch – 7.2                                                                                        “Rain, would you please stand?”Rain stood, his chair scraping, the man beside him remained seated, attention and pen on a pad of lined paper in front of him.  Two women and three men sat at the end of the room.  It was a fairly handsome, clean-shaven twenty-something year old in a suit and tie who was doing the formal stuff, it seemed.  The guy put more attention into his grooming and styling his longer blond hair than anyone else at the table had put into theirs, the woman from the Wardens possibly excepted.“Today we’ll be addressing the case of Rain F, that’s R-A-I-N, full name redacted, case number seven-seven-one-one-two to pass our desks here at the Meadows-Corona office.  Rain is a minor at seventeen years of age, and his middle and last names will be redacted and abbreviated, respectively.”Fat lot of good it would do to trim his name when it was as unique as it was.“Our intention today is not to sentence, but to assess if the case is worthy of the court’s attention.  Spoiler, there are charges of manslaughter, so it probably is.  Our secondary duty today is to decide what we’ll do with the person or people in question in the time between now and when the courts can see them.  Have you sought or been provided with counsel, Rain?”“I was provided with counsel, yes.”There was a pause.  The stenographer shifted her keyboard on her desk at the side of the table and it squeaked as it moved.“To summarize, Rain was one of many to submit himself to the custody of the patrol block when the independent farming settlement outside of New Haven was raided.  Both heroes and villains were on the scene, with members of the patrol block supporting the heroes.”Rain hesitated, then bent down to whisper to the lawyer that sat beside him.  The men and women at the table at the far end of the room waited until Rain straightened and raised his hand.“Yes?”  The response came from a man with a gruff voice, a nice suit and white facial hair and hair in need of a bit of a trim.“Can I clarify something?”“Yes.”“If we’re summarizing, I think it’s important to note that the compound was run by the Fallen.  It was a cult.”“Your statement will be noted, Rain,” was the gruff response.“Yes, sir.”There were two women at the table: one was from the Wardens.  The woman that wasn’t was Hispanic, slightly overweight, and dressed a little more casually than I’d expected for a court proctor.  She offered a more gentle elaboration, “This office has more than a hundred people from that settlement to process.  To avoid bias and to be as fair as possible, we’re not going to make any early conclusions about what it was or wasn’t.  As we address you and your situation, we’ll hold to this idea, but we won’t hold you to it.  Do you understand?”“Yes, ma’am.  I can say things as I saw it.”“Exactly,” she said.The second of the men went on with the formalities.  “On that note, to continue the summary, Rain is one of many that this office will be sorting through in the coming days and weeks.  For easier processing, most are being addressed as groups, where the circumstances are similar.  Rain is a unique case.”Hard to deny.“Rain is unique because, point one, he has turned himself in to the authorities with respect to a case of multiple manslaughters.  He expressed the intention of pleading guilty.  Some of those affected are here at the office today, and will provide testimony.”As Rain looked over his shoulder to glance at the people in the room, I followed his gaze.  There were others seated, and any number of them could have been people from the mall.“Point two, Rain admitted to the authorities that he killed a costumed villain with his own hands, known to this office as a Jonathan Seiter, in what Rain states was self defense.”Snag.  How that particular thing was addressed would impact Ashley quite a bit.  Ashley wasn’t conveying much.  She sat with Kenzie.“Point three, Rain admitted to the authorities that he committed, quote, more crimes than he could count, with crimes including theft, grand theft, auto theft, vandalism, and arson.  Much of this occurred before the end of the last calendar era, at what the individual claims was the behest of a villainous group.”He’d done stuff with the Fallen between the time he was a child and the incident at the mall.“Point four, Rain provided information and assistance during the attack on the farming settlement outside New Haven, and this information and assistance was instrumental in mitigating damage and saving lives.”That was our contribution, in part.  I’d spent the better part of a day trying to figure out how to word my letter to the court proctors.  It had been a distraction from the surgery I’d had looming.“Point five, not unique to Rain himself, but necessary to state for the record, is the fact that he and others were under varying degrees of… how did you put it, Kimberly?  We didn’t write it down in the notes.”“Soft mental compulsion,” the woman from the Wardens said.  “Those affected weren’t controlled like a puppet, but they were under threat, much as if there was a gun to their heads or the heads of a loved one.”“Thank you.  The Wardens, corroborating witnesses and others have given us their input on this.  It’s a thing, this compulsion, but it’s not a thing we can prove was in place.”Rain raised his hand again.“Rain?” the woman with the frumpier clothes asked.“I don’t want her power to be a mitigating factor.  I do want to make sure that woman goes to jail and stays there for a long time, that’s the only reason I brought it up.”“Have a seat, Rain,” the woman said.  “Let’s have a conversation.”“A conversation?” he asked.  He took his seat.“I do think we want to talk about that, but let me start off by saying what our goal is here.  When a case crosses our desk, it’s our job to decide if it’s worth the time of a proper court.  If we say yes or no, that doesn’t mean it’s a for-sure yes or no.”Rain nodded.“My personal view is to imagine four cases.  If I put yours with them, is yours going to be the standout case?  Manslaughter, murder, arson, and grand theft are serious things.  I think yours might stand out.”“Yes ma’am.”“You’re turning yourself in.  I imagine your lawyer advised you that if you kept to yourself, you might fly under the radar.  It’s a lot easier to recommend your case to the courts for processing if it’s a plea.”“He did tell me that.”“Why turn yourself in?” she asked.“Because-” Rain started.  “Before that thing at the mall happened, I was a kid, it felt like a long, unpleasant dream.  I was raised with these people, they chose what I read and what I watched for most of my life, and I was raised in compounds like the one that was attacked last week, or in small towns, or cabins.  Nobody really questioned, nobody said any different.  But then the mall happened and for the first time I had to make a choice.”“Elaborate,” the man with the nice hair said.“I was told to guard the door of the mall.  It was left so I could open it if I had to.  I knew… I knew it was a trap.  I was threatened, told not to open it no matter what, but I realized that if I didn’t open it then I’d be in trouble too.  I still didn’t open it, even when I realized people were hurt and scared.  That’s not okay, and I deserve to be punished.”“Were you compelled?” Kimberly asked.“Um.  By Mama Mathers, you mean?”“The soft compulsion,” she said.  “Mama Mathers, yes.”“She was there in the back of my head.  You see visions of her if you think about her, and I thought about her and what she’d do.  She was there, then.”“She can make people lose their minds if they don’t do what she wants,” Kimberly said.Someone in the back stood up.“Sit,” the gruff man said, annoyed.“You can’t go easy on him,” a man said.“Sit.  We will ask you to speak when your turn comes.  If you do not take your seat and remain silent, you will be removed.”There was a pause as people got settled.  There was murmuring, and a bald man at the end of the court proctor’s table banged his cup against the table a few times, in lieu of a gavel.When all had nearly settled, Rain said, “I don’t want you to go easy on me.”“We want a full understanding of the situation,” Kimberly said.  “She could have made you lose your mind, yes?”“Not as much as some did back at the attack on the camp.  I hadn’t talked to her recently, so it wouldn’t have been as strong.”“Still.  She could have.”“Yes,” Rain said.  “But people died and were hurt.  I see and hear them every night in my dreams.  I should have made the call and opened that door.”“Do you think turning yourself in will make that better?” the frumpy woman asked.  “Seeing them in your dreams?”“No,” Rain said.  “I don’t see how that matters.”In the back, Dr. Darnall stood and left the room.⊙I set down on the rooftop as Dr. Darnall erected a blue patio umbrella.“That was quick,” he remarked.  “I thought you would take a few minutes to spot it.”“There aren’t that many rooftops that are that easy to lounge on,” I said.  “A lot of them are in pretty scary shape, actually.  Flying over, I see cracks and water that’s been there long enough to have algae or something form.”“That would explain the mosquito-like flies we’ve been getting,” he said.  “I’m glad to have you here.  Is Victoria okay, or do you prefer a cape name?”“Victoria,” I said.“Victoria,” he said.  He reached over for a handshake, and I shook his hand.  It was cool- probably from the recent work with the umbrella.  “I’m Dr. Darnall.  You can call me doctor, Wayne, or whatever you prefer.”It was hard to imagine calling him Wayne and taking him seriously.  “Doctor,” I said.“Very well,” he replied.He worked with the umbrella for a bit, and I offered my assistance with my one good hand, pulling the fabric of the patio umbrella around one of the prongs.We each settled into chairs.  The metal was cold- even though it was only September, the weather was turning.  There was a gravity to the seasonal change that I couldn’t remember ever experiencing back home on Bet.“Did your friends have their turns in front of the tribunal?”“No.  Rain had his.  Ashley will have hers soon.  I’m helping her pack up her apartment tomorrow.”“With one arm?”“It’s for emotional support, as much as anything.”“Drink?” he asked.  He reached down and pulled a small cooler out from beneath his chair.“Please,” I said.  “Whatever you have would be great.”He had an assortment of sodas, water, lemonade and iced tea.  I took the iced tea, set it down, and got the papers out of my bag.“The stuff you asked me to fill out.”He took it, leaning back in his seat.  It was disconcerting to deal with the silence, when I was used to one person guiding and leading conversation, steering things and making the most out of the hour and a half or however much time was set aside.That had been back at the hospital, though, and maybe the need to fill the silence had been because I’d been something less human.He read through the paperwork, and put it down on the table with the last page on top.My ‘homework’.  I’d submitted the critical information back when I’d made my first appointment, which I’d had to cancel for surgery.  I’d walked away with some information on therapy and what to expect, and this.  Questions.The page he’d left on top had been the unusual exercise in the batch.  The bottom half of the page had been left empty, but for a circle with a thick bold line.  The instruction had been to draw, not write, how I was feeling, and to leave the paper and pen in arm’s reach for a while before and after using the space.I’d settled on a face, drawing it like I might a sighing emoji, eyebrows slightly turned up in worry.  I wasn’t much of an artist.In letting it sit, though, I’d drawn around the perimeter of the face, lines circling the bold circle that framed the face.I felt self-conscious about it.  Now it sat on the table, between the two of us, the page facing nobody in particular.“Anything you want to get off your chest before we start?” he asked.  “Some people come to a session with something in mind.”“Uh,” I said.  I leaned back, holding my iced tea.  “No, no I guess not.  This feels pretty different from what I’ve experienced in the past.”“The therapy you got at the hospital?”“And what I saw of the session with the group,” I said.With Jessica.  The rooftop seat gave me a view of the broken skyline, and the place where Jessica might have died.  It made me uneasy.  Powers had taken my body from me, they’d briefly taken my heart, and they’d almost taken my mind.  They’d taken my forcefield and strength and given it over to something else.Now they’d taken the sky, and with it, they’d taken the one person that I’d known in my life who could make things better without betraying me.Maybe that was unfair to Crystal and Gilpatrick, to give them the unfair label of people who had helped me but who didn’t help, in that way that I couldn’t put words to.“Thinking of Jessica?” he asked.“Yeah.  I don’t want to dwell on it too much,” I said.  I put my iced tea down.  “I’m here for therapy.”“The therapy I provide is going to be different because I’m new to working with capes.  My background is in cognitive-behavioral therapy, and in the past I worked with police officers, paramedics, firemen, doctors, and other rescue personnel.”“It seems pretty relevant,” I said.“I think so,” he said.  “But powers are complicated and you might have to talk me through some things you take for granted.  If you can be patient with me, I’d like to work with you on identifying problems and goals, then addressing your patterns of thought and action to change your emotional landscape, fix the problems, and reach the goals.”“You might have a bit of an uphill battle, doctor.”“Which part?” he asked.“Thought, action, emotional landscape, problems and goals.  All of the fucking above.”“Do you want to try explaining it?” he asked.  “A big part of what we would be doing is setting goals.  A starting point in figuring out what to address or explaining yourself in totality could be starting off with where you’re coming from, where you are currently, and where you’re going.”“I-” I started.  It was hard to put things into words.  “Currently I’m bothered.  Because I feel like ambushing me at the courthouse, having me draw the image instead of writing out my feelings, leaving that image out where I can see it, and having this meeting on the rooftop, it’s… confrontational.”“Confrontational,” he said.  His eyebrows went up briefly.  “Can you elaborate?”“Pushing me, or testing my boundaries, trying to catch me off balance.  It feels like little plays I’ve had to deal with for a long time.  I don’t know if you’re doing it intentionally because you want to get past my guard or if it’s unintentional and you’re doing it because you’re insecure.  Because I have experience dealing with people who do that.”“Okay,” he said.  “Let’s get back to that in a minute.”“Fine.  Where am I from?  I was raised by capes to be a cape, and after finally getting powers I lived a lifetime in three years.  I was reborn, I rushed through my education, I made mistakes, I started working, I found someone who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, I… started losing people.  I went to the funerals.  I gave my dad showers, because he needed the care.  Then it was my turn, except… worse than death.  I ended up in a hospital and a care center, broken and kind of forgotten or ignored.  I can’t leave that hospital room or that feeling.”“I’ve heard the general story.  We will touch on that.  I think I can help you if you want that help.  I’ve dealt with a lot of people who had rooms or scenes they couldn’t put behind them.”I shrugged.  “I don’t think it’s that easy.  It was two years that I was like that.  Every moment was a scene unto itself.”“Understood.  Just do me a favor and don’t dismiss the idea of it being fixable right away.”“Okay,” I said.“That’s where you’re coming from, then.  A lifetime of crisis is hard enough to deal with, and you didn’t have the tools to deal with it.”“I had some,” I said, annoyed.  Annoyed because he wasn’t jumping to the right conclusion and because he wasn’t Jessica.  There couldn’t be a Jessica because Jessica was gone.  “I was raised to be a heroine.  I didn’t do it all right, I cringe at who I used to be, and how I used to hurt people, but I was given more tools than most people my age, I think.”“Okay,” he said.“Yeah.  I’m getting sidetracked.  Where am I now?  I’m trying to make sure that a whole lot of people, some of Jessica’s old patients foremost among them, don’t end up like I did, because there’s nothing I’m willing to do to undo that or unlive those years, but I can at least save other people from it.”I stabbed the table a few times with my finger to punctuate the last few words.“You feel what you had to deal with with could have been averted, and you want to avert it for others.”“One thousand percent,” I said, with emotion.  “One thousand fucking percent, it could have been averted.”“By an outsider?  Or by someone close to the situation?”“Both.  By- by any of us paying more attention or communicating more, or paying more attention to powers and how powers work, or being a little bit more of an actual family.  It could have been better if I’d fought better or harder and torn through some mutant dogs and gotten home sooner, if I’d dodged that one acid spittle or follow-up hit and avoided being taken out of commission, or if one less person had died maybe those of us who were grieving might have been clearer headed and we could have steered things away.”He gave me a sympathetic look.  When he answered me, I couldn’t hear him that well in the physical feeling of how agitated I was and how uncomfortable I was in my own skin.  I hadn’t nosedived into panic or feeling off, but I’d walked here and I’d gotten out of breath walking.  Now I couldn’t get back into breathing regularly.I wasn’t making sense, because he didn’t have the context for all of that.I didn’t want to make sense.I wanted to put him off balance, to shake him and get more of a sign than a sorry look and kind, quiet assurance that he could put me on the right track.I wanted to gut him.  Not to impale him or tear his stomach out, but to make him feel a fraction of what I felt, emotionally.“Breathe,” he said.“I’ve become pretty-” I started.  I stumbled on the word.“Breathe.”“Pretty accustomed to the breathing, thank you very much.”“Okay,” he said.  “Good.  Come back to here.  This rooftop.  Cool weather, your drink.  Have a taste.”“I’m not not here,” I said.  “Okay?”“Got it,” he said.  “Do you want to take a minute to catch your breath?  What works for you?”“I don’t-” I said.  I stopped.  “I’m fine.”“Do you want to carry on with that thread of conversation, or would you like to change topics?”“I don’t see the point in carrying on, I guess,” I said.  “I don’t want to sound like I’m resistant to therapy or anything, but I’m kind of frustrated.”“Okay,” he said.  “You don’t see the point- are you frustrated because you think this is insurmountable?  Or is it because you don’t feel heard?”“Both,” I said.  “No.  Actually, neither.”He nodded slowly.  “Neither, then.”“I think there are skills I can learn and ways I can deal better.  I think this is doable.  But I think the way we’re going about it is wrong.  Because you hear a good bit of what I’m saying, not all, and you don’t understand.”“Fair,” he said.  “I can’t know your experience.  I do think I can come to understand it.”“That feels like a canned answer,” I said.  “Like the kind of thing someone says when they can’t come up with a good response.”“Victoria,” he said.  “I am on your side here.”“I know,” I said.  “Absolutely.”“Okay?” he asked.  “Yes, maybe the response was a little trite, but I don’t think it’s wrong.  I can’t know where you’re coming from.  From what you describe, that could be a good thing.  From what you describe and from what I was told, the experience was legitimately horrifying.  Sometimes when you’re in a bad place you need someone who isn’t in that place to lead the way out.”I drew in a breath.  He held up a hand.“Canned, I know.  Bear with me, please.”“Bearing,” I said.“If it reassures you, I have a lot of experience helping people through trauma.  I’ve spent twelve years with people, with heroes, who were traumatized on and off the job.  I’ve dealt with people who were scarred head to toe, and their experiences after were not too dissimilar to what you most likely experienced in that hospital room.  Others have been through what you’ve been through and they found their way through it.  I have confidence that I can help you do the same.”I drew in a deep breath.“You are not alone,” he said.“You spent a lot of time with heroes, you say, but you don’t mean capes when you say hero.  You’re new to helping caped heroes, you said.”“Yes,” he responded.  “I get it.  You came from a background that celebrates capes, that puts a lot of importance on costumed heroics.  You value that and it matters that I admitted I’m not that experienced.”“I celebrated capes, yeah, but you know my aura is all about awe and fear, right?  I put my awe of capes behind me a good while ago,” I said.  “So that background?  It’s not that I’m elitist.  It’s that I’m worried.  I’m worried you don’t understand because the normal rules do not apply.  Every cape you deal with is alone and unique.  They have their own rules and neuroses.  They have their unique, personal powers and challenges.”“Everyone’s unique, Victoria.  I don’t think that’s exclusive to capes.  We can look to common ground.”I shook my head.  I was getting annoyed again.  I couldn’t put words to what I was trying to encapsulate for him.  Something I felt Jessica Yamada got.  The consequences.  “Capes magnify, okay?  They exaggerate.  The personalities, the issues, the disorders.  Everything gets bigger or more distorted.  It’s why, if you really truly understood what I’m trying to convey, you’d hear what I said back at the courthouse, and you’d find those kids someone.  Because Jessica was worried and Jessica got it.  If you understood, you wouldn’t be here with me, you’d be running to get these kids some attention.”“There aren’t resources.  I’m sorry.”I drew in a breath, then huffed it out, because I couldn’t quite get enough oxygen.  I was too agitated to be still, even to the point of keeping my lungs in a state of equilibrium.I hadn’t responded, so he carried on.  “If you were to work with me, we’d work on outlining goals.  What I would work on you with would be fundamentals.  Fundamentals work because they apply whether you’re a five year old, a police officer, a surgeon, or a person with powers.  You are human.  Most of the rules still apply.”Hosting this first meeting on a rooftop was a mistake, because I felt the very real impulse to just stand from my chair, put down my iced tea, and fly away.I felt other impulses too.  To break the table, to try to drive some point home by scaring him through a display of power.The Warrior Monk wouldn’t have approved of that, though.My voice was small.  “I don’t know if I’m human.”“I beg your pardon?  Is this a case of arguing the idea of ‘parahuman’?”“No,” I said.  My voice sounded very automatic, as I found the words.  “When my- when the incident happened.  I was mutated, changed into a tangle of limbs, heads, torsos, pelvises and connecting tissue.  I couldn’t speak and I couldn’t eat without assistance.  I could barely move under my own power.”“That was outlined for me,” he said.  “I can’t even imagine.”“I had my emotions twisted around.  To make me fall in love with the person who did that to me, and to experience unending heartbreak over the fact that she couldn’t be with me and I couldn’t be with her.  My- she was family, I always saw her as family.  I didn’t exactly leave that behind or stop seeing her that way, so it felt wrong, twisted, even as I felt it in full.”“You would argue, then, that this is beyond the usual human experience?”“I don’t think I’m human, doctor, because when Gold Morning happened, she put me back together.  She fixed the feelings and she stripped away the excess flesh.  She made me the way I had been on the day I’d been when I was turned into a monster.  People came and wrapped blankets around me, and I was numb from shock and trying to remember how to move again when she talked to me.”“She talked to you?”“She rambled.  She was never good in a crisis and me being fixed was a crisis, I guess.  She told me, um-”I scratched at my arm, then stopped myself.“There’s no rush,” Doctor Wayne said.I met his eyes.  “She told me that when she made that body, larger than mine, the sprawling, broken, wretched thing, raw materials were harvested from stray cats, dogs, and rodents.  Birds, bugs, other things.  People’s household pets that were left behind after Leviathan attacked.  She said, um, she said-”I felt like I’d get caught up in a loop of ‘ums’ if I let myself continue talking.  I stopped to drink some of the iced tea I’d barely touched.“Um,” I said, defeating the point of the pause.  “Just, you know, I should be careful about giving or getting transplants.  There’s a chance it wouldn’t be compatible with humans.  Understand?”He didn’t respond.  Good.“Because she didn’t want to get carried away, she wanted to get me as close to normal as she could get me and stop herself there.  Then she said- she’d ask if I wanted more fixes, and I couldn’t talk so I shook my head no.  She asked if I wanted my memories of things erased and I couldn’t let myself have that because there’s nobody left in the world I trust enough to protect me from her, except me.  So I told her no, and I told her never to show her face in front of me again.  So I’m- I’m-”I blinked away tears.“I am very alone, doctor,” I said.  “My maybe-not-one-hundred-percent-human self is going to fight like hell to save people from… from that-”I indicated the horizon.  The portals speared and lurched up into the sky, frozen where they were, the sky on the far side a different shade.“-And from other horrors.  I’m not going to win every fight.  I would really appreciate some help to keep me in the fight.  Because we have a brief moment of calm, and history suggests the periods of calm before the crises get shorter and shorter.”Again, there wasn’t an immediate response.  He fixed his gaze on the broken horizon because it meant he didn’t have to make eye contact with me.I’d gutted him.  It was wholly satisfying and far from being a good feeling.  He’d felt something, been shaken, he was forced to reassess his perspective, and now maybe there was a chance he’d understand.These things weren’t easy.  They required a little baring of the naked and vulnerable soul.  Revealing who and what we were.⊙“Freak.  Monster.”“Enough, thank you.  Please.”The formalities of a courtroom were looking pretty darn sweet, now that things had reached this point.  Rain’s accusers were noisy, and the officers in the room were fighting an uphill battle to keep the peace.They’d been given a chance to speak and make their arguments, and every one was as angry and vicious as the last.I felt uncomfortable.  I was only on the periphery of it.  I couldn’t imagine what Rain felt, being the focus.“That should be enough.  Thank you.  Your feelings have been made abundantly clear, and I and the other court proctors, I’m sure, agree that the pain and loss are real, profound, and very much present.”There were more noises from that part of the room.“May I speak?” someone asked.“If you have something to add, that hasn’t already been stated.”“I do, sir.”It was a young girl, twelve or so.  She had thick, straight dark hair with severe bangs and an ankle-length dress.“Hi, Rain,” she said.  Her voice was steady, but she held a paper or a letter, and it fluttered in her hands.“Hi,” Rain said, his voice faint.“My name is Staci.  I was at the mall, the day the Fallen attacked it, but I was not inside when the attack happened.  I really do not hope that people get upset because they think I have no place to speak.  Two of my friends died that day and I think because I saw the aftermath and how the school and the families dealt with it, my perspective is valid.”Her speaking style was stilted, as she read from the page.“Two people died and three families were left devastated.  Many of their friends were anguished to hear about what happened.  School has not felt the same.”“I’m so sorry,” Rain said.The girl nodded, an intense motion that betrayed nervousness.“I can not imagine what it was like to come from where you did.  I wrote another letter that I planned to read here or give to you and I changed my mind while I sat here listening.  I wrote this down over the last hour.  I don’t think you should blame yourself.  You were a teenager and teenagers don’t always make the best decisions.  I have a big sister, so I know.”It was an attempt at a joke, as she turned to her sister in the seat beside her.  Nobody really laughed, though, and the silent disapproval of the people sitting around her seemed to drive things home, because her nervousness amplified tenfold.  Her mom reached over to rub at her arm and shoulder.“I don’t speak for everyone.  I definitely don’t.  But I’ve hurt and cried a lot over the past year and I’m glad you came here and you did this.  Thank you.  I don’t expect others to but I forgive you.”There were noises of discontent.  People couldn’t shout down a child, but they could make it clear they didn’t agree.“Thank you,” the court proctor said.“Everly?” Rain asked.  “That was your friend?  With the red hair?”“Yes.  And Sarah was the other.  How do you know that?”“I see and hear them every night, in my dreams,” he said.  “Sarah had the blonde hair then.”“Yes.”“I’ve memorized the faces,” Rain said.  “I’m so sorry.”“I don’t blame you for them dying,” Staci said.  “The people who set the fires were the ones to blame.”“I didn’t save them.”“You were scared.”Rain had wet eyes.  “I was so stupid.”“You didn’t have a chance to know better.”The noises from Rain’s detractors grew louder.  Things dissolved from there, with the officers trying to keep order.  Staci ducked out, her parents providing a bit of a shield.  They left through the door.The man with the nice hair announced, “The court would like to take a brief recess.  We’ll give Staci and her family a minute, and then we’ll leave.  There are refreshments out in the hall.  Rain’s acquaintances can stay, as they wanted to provide their testimony regarding his character in private, without giving up identifying details.”The room emptied.  The court personnel, minus some guards that went to the hall, Rain, Rain’s lawyer, and our group remained.“This is hard,” the gruff man with the white, messy hair and beard said.  “We’re short on heroes.”“I know,” Rain said.  He wiped at his eyes.  “I’m not much of a hero.  But I’ll be one in the future, given a chance.”“But you’ve expressed a desire to go to prison,” the gruff man said.“This kind of thing can’t be something where nothing happens,” Rain said.  Sveta’s sentiment.“Prison isn’t there solely for your absolution, Rain,” the frumpy woman said.“I know.”“You reported one attempt on your life.  Do you think you’ll be safer if you’re in custody?”“No,” Rain said.  “Probably the opposite.”“We’ll do what we can.  Your friends.  We will have some questions for the record, but to start us off, do we have any arguments against a stay in the juvenile prison while we wait for the courts to process the young man?”“Yes,” Kenzie said.  Heads turned her way.  “No.  I just think it isn’t right.”“These things rarely are,” Kimberly, the woman from the Wardens said.  “Then to get this out of the way, we note no strong arguments against a stay in our custody.  The crimes are severe enough to warrant one.  You have a few months of wait before the courts will even begin to address your case, but it should be quick once you reach that point.  Time served will count against any sentence.  There will be no remuneration if no sentence is doled out.”“I understand,” Rain said.“Then when the recess concludes, we’ll note the verdict and seal the paperwork.  Until then, if my colleagues don’t mind, I’d like to get as much information as possible from you and your group, for the court record and the Wardens.”“I will help however I can,” Rain said.“Then, to go back to the timing of when you provided information about the Mathers, why the time provided?”“I was sedated for a surgery, swapping my eyes and ears out.  I started to provide information as soon as I was able.  Before then, Mama Mathers was in effect.”“Tell us about the timing of your interactions with her.  We would welcome input from the rest of the group as well.”Rain continued, and I added my own comment.In the moment, though, I was mostly just taking in how Rain seemed to be.  He sat straighter, and he spoke with more conviction.  Something in him that had been bound up was free.  In the face of his sentence and an interrogation from a staff member of the Wardens, Rain looked at ease for the first time I’d ever seen him.  He still wasn’t one to smile, but I imagined he could come close.If only we could all have a Staci.
